title: "Use Vision Table"
---

I bought a vision chart to track my natural vision restoration progress. It only cost me around 10 RMB on JD. I installed it on my bedroom wall as shown below.

An optician at an eyeglasses store taught me how to use it. First, he used a machine to give a brief report on my eyes' myopia. Then he used several lenses, assembling them like Lego, to combine them. Typically, he would use two myopia lenses and one astigmatism lens to construct glasses for one eye, and vice versa for the other eye.

Then he asked me to stand 5 meters away from the wall. The line I could see clearly indicated my vision level.

When I returned home, I decided I could buy a vision chart and check my eyes myself.

It costs around 30 RMB to test my eyes at the store. Doing it myself isn't about saving money - it's about learning.

Interestingly, I've now learned a new way to do things.

After a few days, I decided to buy another type of vision table—a C-shaped vision table.
