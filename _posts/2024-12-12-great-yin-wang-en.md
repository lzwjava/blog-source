This is a story about me and Yin Wang. I just checked my Twitter account.

> "@yinwang0 Oh, this is similar to Lisp. However, I don't quite understand how useful this feature is. I know its introduction helps functional programming by returning multiple values, allowing a single function call to return a lot of data, like how `get-decoded-time` returns the year, month, day, etc. Indeed, the convenience in this regard is already quite powerful."

I replied to this in Chinese on Yin Wang's English account. The date was 2023/08/19.

I started sharing his blog with some friends on 2019/01/31 and continued sharing it with new acquaintances.

On June 11, 2023, I sent him an email titled "Sharing my experiment report with the teacher, 'How I Wear Glasses with 150 Degrees Less Than the Actual Prescription to Reduce Myopia.'" He replied, and we discussed Astigmatism When the Eyeballs Reverse to the Normal Shape.

I reflected a lot on what he said.

Actually, on February 11, 2022, I was kicked out of the discussion group on Telegram by him. I sent the following message to him through another Telegram account:

> "Hi, Teacher Yin Wang, sorry. I was mistakenly thought to be advertising in the group earlier. I was quite surprised, as I had just registered a new account and joined the group. I saw the chat history, and it's true that there are still people seeking the cheapest glasses these days. Here is my purchase record. I really think it's good and convenient online, which is why I recommended it. I've been following you for ten years and also recommend your blog and Weibo to everyone I know. Over the past two years, I have frequently followed your updates. Thank you, and I hope my ban can be lifted. I’ll just quietly observe in the group. It's inconvenient to use my secondary account. Thanks!"

He responded:

> "Whether others want to pursue cheaper glasses is their own business, you don't need to worry about it. Our group is for studying myopia, not for discussing how to save money."

He has shared almost everything he has learned. He truly is my best teacher. His best teacher is his professor, Daniel P. Friedman, who was born in 1944. He is a professor of Computer Science at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, and has dedicated his life to learning.

Yin Wang wrote an article about his story with Daniel P. Friedman, allowing more people to learn about him. He now has 140k followers on Weibo. The title of his article is "GTF - Great Teacher Friedman". So today, I am writing "GTY - Great Teacher Yin" to share a bit of our story. In today's internet age, he is probably the best teacher for 50k people. I guess one-third of them will pay a lot of attention to him.

He truly taught me how to think. He passed on the technique of how to catch fish from Daniel P. Friedman to me. Yin, thank you.
