I have spent numerous years attempting different methods, utilizing multiple apps, and eventually discovered a way to cultivate a love for English and enjoy it without continuous effort. I adopted the practice of utilizing English frequently, reading English news and books, watching American TV shows without subtitles, browsing English websites, and immersing myself extensively in it. Additionally, I had experiences interacting with foreigners and even earned income by communicating with Dutch clients in English for a website project. Here's my story. I found high school English textbooks uninteresting. However, I came across Paul Graham's book "Hackers & Painters" which introduced me to intriguing concepts. I read numerous articles on his website, looking up unfamiliar words in a physical dictionary. In college, I utilized a Chrome plugin for translation and read technical websites. My English conversational and reading skills were limited.

In 2016, I visited the US with limited English proficiency, managing simple conversations and directions. I struggled to understand and felt embarrassed. I focused on work, occasionally reading articles and looking up words. My listening, speaking, and reading skills remained weak.

In May 2019, I aimed for international projects with my outsourcing company and registered on Upwork. To my surprise, a Dutch client contacted me for a website project via WhatsApp communication. I had several voice calls, but my listening skills were not good. I asked the client to speak slowly and repeat himself multiple times. Despite completing the project and earning a few hundred euros, I realized I needed to improve my English.

I used the Kindle Mac app to read "The Accidental President," a book about President Truman during World War II. It was a challenging experience due to the extensive specialized vocabulary and geographic references. However, overcoming this challenge boosted my confidence. I thought if I could finish such a lengthy book, I could handle other articles and everyday written communication.

I continued reading several English books, including "The Everything Store" about Amazon's entrepreneurship story, "To Pixar and Beyond" about Pixar Animation Studios, "Jony Ive" about the Apple designer, "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman" about physicist Richard Feynman, "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind," "The Meaning of It All" by Richard Feynman, and the first ten chapters of "The Feynman Lectures on Physics." I also attempted novels like "The Great Gatsby" and "A Mathematician's Apology" by G.H. Hardy, as well as "A Brief History of Time."

Reading English books was a test of patience, requiring me to immerse myself in the process without worrying about finishing them quickly. I learned not to set rigid goals and allow myself to read at my own pace. This way, I could understand and appreciate the content better.

Books helped me familiarize myself with vocabulary and improve my comprehension. However, they did not significantly enhance my listening skills. So, I turned to watching American TV shows and documentaries on Netflix without subtitles. Although I didn't understand everything, I focused on picking up some vocabulary. I watched various documentaries like "Mission Control," "Our Planet," "American Factory," "Spielberg," "The Bleeding Edge," "The Dawn Wall," "The Edge of Democracy," and "Hondros." I also watched several seasons of "Friends." I became better at listening over time, but I encountered challenges comprehending specific details in videos. I tried using apps like "Youdao Vocabulary" for memorizing words, but gave up after a few days. I came to understand that familiar words should be learned through frequent exposure and comprehension, while uncommon words could be looked up as needed. Constantly memorizing obscure vocabulary seemed laborious and impractical.

I also joined English learning groups on apps such as Telegram and conversed with an Iranian friend for several hours via voice chat to enhance my speaking abilities. Although it was beneficial, speaking with a native English speaker was challenging. However, it presented opportunities to meet individuals from diverse backgrounds, like an Indian man with whom I had a video call, introducing our families to one another.

Looking back on my English learning experience, I recognized that I had taken numerous detours. Instead of focusing on whether learning was enjoyable, I compelled myself to tackle challenging tasks. Just as when we were children learning Chinese, we absorbed Chinese culture through martial arts films, which eventually enabled us to understand and speak the language effortlessly. The secret was immersion and enjoyment.

I hold that once one has mastered approximately 1,000 basic English words, one should immerse oneself in listening and watching content such as TikTok videos or American TV shows. TikTok is particularly advantageous because it integrates entertainment with immersive language learning, simulating face-to-face interactions with foreigners. By doing so, we can naturally learn more words and comprehend more content without the requirement to memorize extensive vocabulary lists. I found that the most effective way to learn is through play, enjoying the process, and having a genuine desire to continue. TikTok significantly contributed to my language improvement, and I strongly suggest it to others. However, accessing TikTok may require bypassing restrictions for certain regions, which could involve using a separate Android phone or learning to access foreign networks.

During my English language learning journey, I pondered the essence of learning. I realized I struggled with self-discipline and perseverance, but excelled when learning became an entertaining experience that I genuinely enjoyed. If we can approach learning as an enjoyable experience, it becomes effortless and sustainable.

Ultimately, I recognized that being proficient in one language, such as Chinese, is sufficient. It enables us to live a rich life in our home country, with an abundance of knowledge and resources in our native language. Nevertheless, for those eager to learn English, I wholeheartedly endorse immersive and enjoyable methods like TikTok to make language learning an enjoyable and stress-free journey.
