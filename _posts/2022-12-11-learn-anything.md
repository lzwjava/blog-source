How to learn anything in a year? Let's take English as an example. I spent one year learning English to achieve IELTS 6 score. Here is my way.

1. Trust yourself. You are a genius. Everyone is a genius.

2. Find the real expert on the Internet. They really know, and they share a lot, Like the teacher Yin Wang.

3. Find all interesting materials on the Internet. Like Youtube, Bilibili, Tiktok, Douyin, Tencent Video, WeChat Channels, Twitter, Google. 

4. Start small. You can watch any short videos or long videos as long as they have English.

5. Step by Step. If you don't know English at all, please learn the basic alphabet and 100 simple words for your first two months.

6. 16 hours to learn. If you can play mobile phone, then play it. If you can't play, then listen with a Bluetooth earphone or speaker. Listen when driving. Listen when taking care of your baby. Listen when cooking. Listen when falling asleep.

7. Go crazy. Then you can't live without English all the time. You must ensure you have some English materials to listen to as long as you are awake.

8. Know yourself and be focused. Let the lecture audios float around your ears, you will be automatically focusing time by time. When I drive for 2 hours, I must listen carefully for 1 hour. 

9. Take exams and then know your limit. Though my IELTS 6 score is good, However, most of the top 50 need IELTS 6.5 or 7. So be humble.

10. Polish your skills. Write down what you hear on the computer. Just write some notes and some words instead of whole articles. So it's easy. No transcribing software can work better than this way. And write down what you want to share, and share them with your friends.

11. Keep finding ways to learn interestingly. Like using DeepL or Grammarly to check your grammar. Like finding foreign friends to talk to. Like using simple English words to chat with your Chinese friend on WeChat.

12. The ultimate way is to think about it all the time. Think in English. Talk to yourself in English all the time. Write in English, Think in English, Listen in English, Read in English, and Speak in English. 

13. Everything can be learned in this way. Think in math, speak in Math, write in math, listen in math, read in math. 

14. To be short, as long as you are awake, keep inventing new ways to learn happily about the topic. And then you find that you don't need to learn, you just live with it. It is your soulmate, you live all the time with your soulmate.
