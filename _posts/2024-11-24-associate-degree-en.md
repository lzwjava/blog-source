Below is my assoiciate progress. 

Guangdong University of Foreign Studies，Computer Application, Associate Degree, 2022.10 - Present

* National Higher Education Self-study Examination. Passed 7 courses as of today, Introduction to Operating Systems, Introduction to Data Structures, Advanced Language Programming (I), English (I), Advanced Mathematics, Database and Applications, Computer Application Technology.
* Currently preparing for 9 courses such as Computer Organization and Architecture, Computer Networks, Basic Electronic Technology (III), Microcomputer and Interface Technology, College Chinese, Mao Zedong Thought and Theory of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, and Ideological and Moral Cultivation and Legal Basics, Linear Algebra, Introduction to Law.

I am unhappy about my progress. It is slow. The reason is that I mainly prepare it for one year until now.

## Reasons for Passing Courses
* Had strong foundational knowledge before the exam, like Introduction to Data Structures and English
* Prepared thoroughly in recent months, like Advanced Mathematics and Database Applications

## Reasons for Failed Courses
* Overestimated preparation level - completed fewer practice exercises for failed subjects compared to passed courses
* Did not allocate sufficient time for preparation
* Relied too heavily on passive video watching without active learning

## Exam Preparation Strategies
* Maintain a healthy sleep routine and ensure adequate rest
* Verify exam locations in advance, as morning and afternoon sessions may be at different venues
* Complete exam registration within deadline periods
