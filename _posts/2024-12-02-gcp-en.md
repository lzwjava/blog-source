I have written an article titled [Some Global Cloud Platforms](./cloud-platforms-en). Recently, I gained more experience with Google Cloud.

I needed a proxy server to use as a VPN to connect to networks that are blocked by the GFW. I hadn't tried Google Cloud before, so I decided to test it. You can use an OCBC credit card to get $200 in credits. However, for some reason, sometimes your spending won't be counted against your credits, but instead charged as actual spending.

In the latest month, I spent around 75 SGD on Google Cloud. This was basically for just one compute engine instance (1 vCPU, 1 10GB disk, Jurong West, Singapore).

I have used Digital Ocean for a long time. It is much cheaper. It only costs 6 USD per month for a Droplet (1 vCPU, 1GB Memory, 25GB SSD, Singapore).

However, after using Google Cloud's pricing calculator, I realized that the issue might be with Outline. I used Outline Manager to set up the proxy server.

The machine type is an important factor. I need to do more research on this.
