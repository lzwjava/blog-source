title: 'Natural Vision Restoration: The Principle of "Just Barely Clear"'
---

## Key Discovery

After extensive experimentation and observation, I've discovered that the most crucial principle in myopia reversal is wearing glasses that make objects "just barely clear" at your typical viewing distances. This is more important than adhering to a fixed reduction number like 150, 175, or 200 degrees.

## The "Just Barely Clear" Principle

The optimal prescription reduction should achieve this state:
- Objects should be just clear enough to see without straining
- Text should be readable but not crystal clear
- Your eyes should feel relaxed, not struggling to focus

From my experience:
- For mobile phone use, typically reducing by about 175-200 degrees achieves this "just barely clear" state
- For computer work, about 150 degrees reduction often works well
- Though I personally can wear glasses with 175-200 degrees reduction for both mobile phone and computer use - I simply move my head slightly forward to see the computer screen barely clear
- However, these numbers are guidelines - your optimal reduction may differ

## How to Find Your "Just Barely Clear" Prescription

1. Start with your current prescription
2. Try glasses with different reductions (150-200 degrees less)
3. Observe which prescription allows you to:
   - Read your phone just clearly enough
   - See your computer screen without strain
   - Function comfortably in daily life

The key is finding the prescription that keeps things just at the edge of clarity - clear enough to function, but not so clear that your eyes aren't encouraged to adapt.

## Why I Emphasize "Just Barely Clear" So Much

I want to share an important personal experience that illustrates why the "just barely clear" principle is so crucial. In the first year of using this method, my myopia reduced by about 100 degrees, which was an exciting result. However, in the second year, there was no significant improvement in my myopia. After deep reflection, I discovered the likely reason:

In the first year, I primarily used a computer for work while wearing glasses with a 150-degree reduction, which created many opportunities for "just barely clear" vision. However, in the second year, while studying for my associate degree at home, I reduced my computer usage and mainly used my mobile phone for exercises and reading exam materials.

This led me to revisit Yin Wang's article, particularly this crucial passage:
>"When looking at distant objects, the crystalline lens needs to relax and reduce refraction. If the image still falls in front of the retina after the lens is completely relaxed, objects appear blurry. If you continue to look at the object in this state, the external eye muscles will begin to gently compress the eyeball, making the optical axis slightly shorter (perhaps only 0.x millimeters), and the blurry object will gradually become somewhat clearer. If you frequently maintain this slightly blurry state, the repeated small compressions of the optical axis will lead to permanent shortening, and myopia will reverse."

This passage was a revelation to me. Based on this understanding, I recently tried glasses with both 175 and 200-degree reductions, which have worked well. By creating more "just barely clear" states, I expect my myopia to reduce by another 100 degrees in the coming year. Let's see what happens.

This experience teaches us that the key isn't about reducing by a fixed number of degrees, but rather about consistently maintaining the "just barely clear" state. The specific reduction needed to achieve this state may vary for each person, but what's important is finding and maintaining this optimal point.

## Practical Tips

1. Daily Use:
   - Use these reduced prescriptions for most daily activities
   - Objects should never be so blurry that you strain to see
   - If you find yourself squinting or straining, your reduction might be too large

2. Safety:
   - Use full correction for driving
   - Keep a stronger prescription pair for situations requiring perfect vision
   - Listen to your body - no pain or significant discomfort should occur

3. Adaptation:
   - Give yourself 2-3 days to adapt to reduced prescriptions
   - The initial blur will improve as your eyes adjust
   - Don't force clarity - let it come naturally

## Monitoring Progress

You can tell your eyes are improving when:
- Objects that were blurry become clearer without changing glasses
- You can function comfortably with the reduced prescription
- Your vision testing shows improvement over months

## Conclusion

The secret to natural vision improvement lies not in any specific degree reduction, but in finding that sweet spot where your vision is "just barely clear." This creates the optimal condition for your eyes to gradually improve.

Remember:
- Focus on finding your personal "just barely clear" point
- This might be around 150-200 degrees less than your current prescription
- The exact reduction matters less than achieving that optimal state of clarity
- Be patient and consistent - improvement takes time

I encourage you to try this approach yourself. Pay attention to what prescription allows you to see things "just barely clear" in your daily life. That's your optimal prescription for vision improvement.
