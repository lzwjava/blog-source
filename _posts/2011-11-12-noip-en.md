Departing from Guangzhou Ronggang, arriving at Zhongshan Nanlang Town. I thought there would be enough time to take the Chinese test followed by the Mathematics test, but to my surprise, the Chinese test was finished in just two hours. Besides the fame and reputation of Zhongshan Memorial Middle School, there's not much else noteworthy about the town. The students of Zhongshan Memorial Middle School often take leisurely strolls to Sun Zhongshan's residence. Couples can even rent a rickshaw and hold hands while imagining the deep longing and speechless moments between Sun Wen and Song Qingling. Sun Wen's bed was wider than that of Juyuan's, but it was about ten centimeters shorter. I guess Sun Wen was a real six-footer. Six-footers spent their nights on that bed from 1892 to 1895.

I arrived at the first canteen of Jici around 7:15 am for breakfast. Jici has two canteens, and they are not as refined as those in Juyuan, so they were named accordingly: the first canteen and the second canteen. The second canteen was not open at 7:15, and it was empty when I passed by. At the first canteen, there were still many students in Jici uniforms having breakfast at 7:20. It's unlikely that so many students overslept, and considering today was Saturday, it's probably because their weekend rest schedule is different from usual.

Jici gave me a feeling of being in a university campus. It's spacious, with wide campus roads on both sides having long pedestrian walkways. If the path from Sun Zhongshan Memorial Hall to the canteen were also made into a pedestrian walkway, it would seem absurd. However, this is natural in Jici. Jici is built in a forest, surrounded by green trees.: Before the exam, I met a chubby guy, let's call him Fat Brother. Fat Brother shared with me his experience of learning algorithms. They had over fifty people playing CS in a room. Later, the teacher thought they were wasting time, so he abruptly stopped them, probably using the disconnect-the-internet trick. They all showed their protest by playing Minesweeper instead...

Arriving at the exam room, a lush green hill came into view. To my surprise, Windows XP was provided instead of the depressing Linux I had grown accustomed to in the past few days. I had installed Linux and familiarized myself with the environment, allowing me to write code and debug normally. However, it took me almost five hours to fully adapt. For those like Fat Brother who had never used Linux to code before, it would be a fatal blow. I didn't know how to compile PASCAL on Linux, but finding the Linux command line terminal would have shattered the keys on my keyboard. The person sitting to my right was Chen Yixiang from Shantou. He wrote code quickly, completing all the questions and providing extreme data to support his programs.

My exam process was quite complicated. The examiner intended to use the first question to encourage everyone and boost morale, but I disappointed him. C++, please grant me immense space to open a 100,000*100,000 space. He said I was incapable, urging me to optimize my program and reduce its space complexity. I said, "What?" I vowed to fight to the end. By mistake, I reduced the 100,000*100,000 space to 100,000*3.

The examiner had anticipated that I would struggle with the first question, so he gave me another one to boost my confidence. This time, I listened. The third question was about using a specified number of steps to pass a game. I wrote an enjoyable program and the exam ended while I was playing it...

The second day continued... If you come out with a jade boulder, it's not easy. Outside, enjoy yourself well. I. Problem Description

Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array answer such that answer[i] is the index of each element in nums that equals i.

II. Examples

Input: nums = [4,2,2,3,1]
Output: [3,2,1,4,0]

III. Constraints

* n is in the range [1, 10^5]
* The numbers in nums are unique.

IV. Hints

* Use a hash table to store the index of each number in nums.
* Iterate through nums and add the index to the hash table when encountering a number equal to i.
* Return the array of indices in the same order as they appear in nums.
