### Foreword

The above glasses and 1 year time helped me to confirm this extraordinary discovery from Yin Wang. 

He wrote an article around 2022 February. You may check it out here, [http://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2022/02/22/myopia](http://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2022/02/22/myopia). Now it is 2023 June. With his help, I have done the experiment for a year. And I will continue to do it. So let me share my discovery in this experiment.

## Myopia Reports

This is my myopia report on 5 March 2022:

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/eyes/22.03.05.jpeg" width="400px" /><img/></div>

This is my myopia report on 13 November 2022:

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/eyes/22.11.13.jpeg" width="400px" /><img/></div>

This is my myopia report on 20 April 2023:

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/eyes/23.04.20.jpeg" width="400px" /><img/></div>

You could check carefully. I did all my myopia reports in one store nearby my home. All the information is correct except that in the last report, the clerk listened to my name poorly so he wrote it as "梁先生" instead of "李先生".

Let's make a table to show it better.

Time | Myopia In Left| Astigmatism In Left| Myopia In Right | Astigmatism In Right|
2022.03.05| 350 |225|575|175
2022.11.13| 325| 200| 550|175
2023.04.20| 300| 125| 500|125

You could see that in one year, my left eye's myopia degree is reduced from 350 degrees to 300 degrees, and my right eye's myopia degree is reduced from 575 degrees to 500 degrees. And regarding astigmatism, my left eye's astigmatism degree is reduced from 225 degrees to 125 degrees. And my right eye's astigmatism degree is reduced from 175 degrees to 125 degrees. 

Is it shocking? It was very shocking to me when I got the report. In November 2022, I found my eyesight improved. I was a little shocked, but not much. So I said to myself, let's see another half a year. And then after half a year, when I did the checking, I was super shocked. 

## How I do it

Thanks for the pictures I took. We can see here how I do it.

Let's see the report on 13 November 2022 carefully.

Item | Myopia In Left| Astigmatism In Left| Myopia In Right | Astigmatism In Right|
My eyesight | 325 |200|550|175
Eye glasses I was wearing| 225| 200| 450|175

Here, we found that the astigmatism degrees are matched between my eyesight and eyeglasses. And the degree of eyeglasses I was wearing is 100 degrees less for both my right and left eye.

So at that time, I changed to a new pair of eyeglasses with 150 degrees less. So I bought one around November 2022 with the specification:

Item | Myopia In Left| Astigmatism In Left| Myopia In Right | Astigmatism In Right|
Old glasses I was wearing|  225| 200| 450|175
New glasses I changed| 175| 200| 400|175

You could see here that the degrees between old and new are that for myopia, it is 50 degrees less, and for astigmatism, it remains the same.

So after half a year, on 20 April 2023, I got the latest report about my eyesight:

Item | Myopia In Left| Astigmatism In Left| Myopia In Right | Astigmatism In Right|
My eyesight | 300 |125|500|125
Eye glasses I was wearing| 175| 200| 400|175

So my eyesight improved again:

Time | Myopia In Left| Astigmatism In Left| Myopia In Right | Astigmatism In Right|
2022.11.13| 325| 200| 550|175
2023.04.20| 300| 125| 500|125

For this half a year, I don't know why the astigmatism of my eyes reduced. However, the myopia of my eyes continues to reduce with the left 25 degrees, and the right 50 degrees.

So I can say that, I wore eyeglasses for a year with 150 degrees less than the actual to reduce the myopia of my left eye by 50 degrees and the myopia of my right eye by 75 degrees.

## Practical Tips

When you just got your new pair of eyeglasses with 150 degrees less, you are uncomfortable a bit. The view far away seems unclear. But, after you wear it for a few days, you can adapt soon. The eyes are smart to adapt fast. It won't affect our daily study, work, or life. Now, I only will change my eyeglasses to the ones whose degree is 50 degrees less than the actual one when I drive, when I attend the courses the company arranged and I need to see the whiteboard, when traveling or in the cinema.

The rule is it is enough to just see things. We don't need to see much clear. And for our daily life, we mainly use mobile phones or computers.

The reason why people got deep myopia is that people wear full degrees eyeglasses to look at very near things most of the time. So actually wearing 150 degrees less is enough for people to see near things clearly. That's why we can find that some people's myopia never exceeds 200 degrees. Normally, they don't wear glasses. They only wore eyeglasses when they need to see the whiteboard.

I started to wear glasses around my second year in junior middle school. And I wore it all the time, That's why the myopia of my eyes evolve from around 200 degrees to 375 degrees left and 575 degrees right. And now, I wear eyeglasses with 150 degrees less than actual to make my eyes just can see near things then I made the myopia of my eyes reduced to 300 degrees left and 500 degrees right.

For Chinese readers, you could buy the glasses in the Pinduoduo. It just cost around 60 CNY to buy. And for the myopia checking, it just costs 48 CNY to check in on the minus 1 floor in Wanda Square.

## The Underlying Reason

It is complicated to understand the underlying reason. Please check out Yin Wang's article here if you are interested. [http://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2022/02/22/myopia](http://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2022/02/22/myopia)

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/eyes/eye-camera.jpg" width="400px" /><img/></div>

Here's one of the pictures in his article. To be honest, I don't understand every detail too.

## Further Report

I will post my further eyesight report in the next few years.  Now:

Time | Myopia In Left| Myopia In Right | 
My eyesight| 300|  500|
The eyeglasses I am wearing| 150| 350|

And in the ongoing years, it will be:

Time | Myopia In Left| Myopia In Right | 
My eyesight| 300| 500|
My possible eyesight after one year| 250| 425|
My possible eyesight after two years|200|350|
My possible eyesight after three years|150|275|

So after three years, my left eye doesn't need glasses with degrees anymore. 

## Amazing New Theory

After writing these and reviewing the article, I probably found something new. It is not mentioned in the teacher Yin Wang's article. That's the reason why after one year, both my eyes are wearing eyeglasses with 150 degrees less than the actual, but the reduced degrees are different between my left eye and right eye. That's probably because my right eye's muscles are distorted much more than my left eye. So when the muscles get recovered to the normal state, the right eye can recover faster. It is just like machine learning, it learns fast at first and then slowly. So the provisioning table of my eyesight in the next years is wrong in that it uses a linear way, that is, every year, my right eye's myopia degree will reduce by 75 degrees and my left one by 50 degrees. When my right eye's myopia degree will probably reduce by 50 degrees too when it hits below 400 degrees.

You probably won't find any place on the Internet there are people saying this. It is really interesting. Zhiwei does things and thinks more carefully when he gets old. If his theory is true, he can tell better how many years that need for one to recover from myopia symptoms. It will give people much more confidence.

Let's do experiments, be a friend of the time, and try to prove this.

## Follow Up

Please check out the article [The discussion regarding astigmatism when the eyeballs reverse to the normal position](./astigmatism). There are some corrections. Actually, if we count astigmatism, then the degrees of both my left eye and right eye are reduced by about 100 degrees.
