title: "Finding the Right Winter Gloves"

My journey to find suitable winter gloves for computer work has been challenging. I first tried two-finger gloves, but they proved impractical - Mac touchpad scrolling requires the middle finger along with thumb and index finger. Five-finger gloves offered better dexterity but were too bulky for comfortable typing.

I've now ordered a sleeve-style option and hope it will better meet my needs for both warmth and functionality.
