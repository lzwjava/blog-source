title: "My Creative Ideas - Updating"
---

If you want to write a long essay and not a boring one, how do you make it? As I am learning English writing now, I can't express a lot of topics fluently. So my way is to write an article about my creative ideas. It is not boring to me as they are my new ideas and I like to share them. It is not boring to readers as they are somehow creative. Because I am a lazy person and lack of patience to write boring stuff. And I have the habit of accumulating my ideas in the app Microsoft To Do. I write shortly there, so here, I select some ideas and explain a bit. Let's begin.

### How to write long essays

One of the keys to writing long essays is to share what you want to say. Just like sharing with your friends. Share something new and interesting things. We don't talk about the boring stuff again and again. But we do want to talk about new things. 

However, in my previous essays, I at most write around 1000 words in an essay. Then I gave up and publish it. So the trick is to suppress my urge to publish. And write a few paragraphs when having a good mood and write it for a whole week. Just like listening to English lectures to learn English. Don't push yourself and make everything happens smoothly.

You can see that it is not only the recipe to write long essays. It is a recipe to do a tedious task. It is a recipe to achieve something great.
