title: "My Creative Ideas - Updating"
---

If you want to write a long essay and not a boring one, how do you make it? As I am learning English writing now, I can't express a lot of topics fluently. So my way is to write an article about my creative ideas. It is not boring to me as they are my new ideas and I like to share them. It is not boring to readers as they are somehow creative. Because I am a lazy person and lack of patience to write boring stuff. And I have the habit of accumulating my ideas in the app Microsoft To Do. I write shortly there, so here, I select some ideas and explain a bit. Let's begin.

### How to write long essays

One of the keys to writing long essays is to share what you want to say. Just like sharing with your friends. Share something new and interesting things. We don't talk about the boring stuff again and again. But we do want to talk about new things. 

However, in my previous essays, I at most write around 1000 words in an essay. Then I gave up and publish it. So the trick is to suppress my urge to publish. And write a few paragraphs when having a good mood and write it for a whole week. Just like listening to English lectures to learn English. Don't push yourself and make everything happens smoothly.

You can see that it is not only the recipe to write long essays. It is a recipe to do a tedious task. It is a recipe to achieve something great. 

### How to change the working language of a company

Nowadays, many Chinese technology companies go overseas to earn global money. There are reasons for companies to change the working language. It is better to communicate with end customers and users. It is better to understand what they need. However, it probably is one of the biggest challenges for these companies.

I spent one year to be able to use English to work fluently in a global company. Indian and Singaporean colleagues helped me and had the patience to repeat several times to let me understand. I learned English hard after getting off work. And how you can help your employees to do so. It's the job of universities or English training centers. 

I think the first approachable way is that make everywhere full of English. We provide bilingual offer letters and anniversary celebration words. We provide bilingual contracts and an office automation system. We let every internal tool support English too. Though it is hard to require employees to write English documents, however, in those tools and formal documents, we just need to write the English version once. 

Then after a year, for some easy tools or documents, we remove the Chinese version and just provide the English version. So just step by step, let English float around the company.

In the meantime, we can begin to open a development center for foreign companies. For example, in Singapore, we hire some people who are from local, India or Vietnam. Let every team have English-only speakers. So in the meetings, we have to discuss in English. 

I believe in this way, just need 2 or 3 years to change the working language of a company regardless of the company size. At least for the development apartment, engineers are eager to learn.
