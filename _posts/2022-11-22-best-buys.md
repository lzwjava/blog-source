### Royalstar Dryer, 378 CNY

Living in the south of China is a bit painful because the clothes can't dry up on wet days. So I tried to solve this problem. I once bought a big dryer, like the below one. It is a portable closet plus a dryer machine on the bottom. It can contain a lot of clothes inside the closet. You can dry them in a two-hour run.

However, the disadvantage is that it is too large. So when I moved out of my parent's house and rent a small room with other guys, I found that I couldn't buy that product to solve the problem anymore. Because we share a house. 4 guys share a house of 100 square meters size. And my room is just 8 square meters. And there is not much space in the living room and balcony. So I found this small dryer, Royalstar Dryer. It just cost me 378 CNY to order in Pinduoduo.

The user experience is wonderful. The capacity is suitable for one person and it just occupies a small place. The bottom size is 38cm * 38cm， just like the bottom size of a rice cooker. And its height is 74cm, just like the length of your hand.

I don't use it to dry my clothes directly after the washing machine finished washing them. When I want to take a shower, then I go to pick up my clothes. If I find some of them still wet in some parts of the cloth, then I will put them in the dryer. And turn the program to the outerwear level, and set a timer of 1 hour. And I just go to get my other clothes to wear temporarily. After taking my shower and waiting some moments, then the clothes will be dried up. So I can dress my favorite clothes again.

I know the dryer is popular in the western country. However, that kind of dryer is just like the washing machine. It is big. Whatever, Royalstar Dryer is my best buy this year.

### Myopic Sunglasses, 68 CNY

I once shared that I bought my myopic glasses in Pinduoduo with decent money. This time, it turns to sunglasses. I bought a pair of the below kind. The right lens is 500 myopia degrees and 175 astigmatism degrees. The left lens is 275 myopia degrees and 200 astigmatism degrees.

I use it in the daytime when I drive my car. It is too comfortable wearing it for looking ahead to be unable to leave it. The sunlight is harsh.
