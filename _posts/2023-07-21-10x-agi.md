title: "The 10x AGI Information World"
---

10x here means 10 times. AGI stands for "Artificial General Intelligence." So, I use three adjective words to describe the future world. And 16 million people in the world might be aware that the future will be the AGI world. Midjourney has around that user account as of July 2023. And ChatGPT had 100 million users in January 2023. So if we choose a number to define the count of serious AI tool lovers, we probably want to choose 16 million. ChatGPT is a text conversation tool, it is simple and direct. And Midjourney is a tool to help generate images by AI algorithms. That's the tool serious lovers will try.

10x means that it is really fast, faster than the normal 10 times. And it has no question to say this world is an Information World as the number of Internet users in the world reached 5.160 billion people.

The people who work hard and think hard will be more optimistic about the future.  One reason is that you have a feeling to impact the world by using your brain. Another reason is that as you learn more, you know that human society is just beginning its technology chapter. The third reason is that you have the boldness to suspect the opinions of everyone. So the future seems interesting if you think you can prove you are right about something few in the world know. 

And I am one of these people after 28 years of learning in this world. So here I want to share the future world I think. 

## How We Work 

I think that Jira and Confluence are outdated in the 10x AGI information world. They should totally integrate the power of AGI and GPT. We may say a lot of Jira issues shouldn't be created by product managers. We should let users use AI tools to create it. And then the issues created by the users with the help of AI tools will automatically calculate out the assignee. The AI-powered Jira will use the description of the issue, and all internal information (like documents and code) to know this issue should be assigned to who.

When we mention the assignee, the one is an AI-powered developer or tester, or an AI-powered full-stack worker. We may not need to differentiate roles like product manager, developer or tester anymore. They are all AI-powered full-stack workers. 

And when we think about it, we should think, in that world, why we still need users to report bugs or issues to us. Why we don't create a lot of AI-powered test users to do so? The perfect app is hard to make because it has a lot of scenarios to use and a lot of users with different backgrounds. They need the app to support the language they like. They like it just like ChatGPT. A very basic and simple conversation interface with any language it support. The main disadvantage of it is that it needs users to type text to input. However, it is inconvenient to input in mobile phones. And when users input from mobile phones, a lot of them like to separate their messages for the fast speed and convenience. It is easier to send three short phrases instead of one complete message. The input message box is also not supporting the long text well. 

I just checked the ChatGPT iOS App. Though the input box will expand like below, the user habit is hard to change to send short phrases instead of whole sentences.

And however, I just found that ChatGPT supports voice input here. So it is easier to input the long text. And we can close this discussion as they already know it. 

Let's come back to our discussion about how we work in the future. Suppose we have PayGPT work as a payment app with AI power and ChatGPT interfaces. How should we iterate the products? What's the gap between the ChatPT and the PayGPT? Underlying these data-sensitive applications are databases. So we should ask what's the gap between text and database?

How about we just export the database to text, train it to the language model, and then query it? How do we deal with the user rights problem? One user should be only able to access his data, part of his friends' data, and the public data of the app. Do we need to train a language model for every user? Or that we have pre-trained large language model, and then we input the user context to them, and then we begin to query.
