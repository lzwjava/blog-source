title: "Why and How I Learn Japanese"
--- 

Two years ago, I learned Japanese for two weeks, then I put it away and did other things. Now, I have restarted my journey to learn it. What I have observed is that this time things are much smoother. I can still recognize some Katakana and Hiragana. My journey has just begun, and this time, instead of following any advice, I have used some unique ways to learn. I drive cars to learn. After logging off from work, I drive for 4 hours while listening to Japanese TikTok or some Japanese music. Because driving requires patience, it makes me more patient. When driving, you can’t go faster; you have to wait for the car or traffic light ahead. Driving can also be boring, so it's better to have something to think about. I bought a remote control to hold in one of my hands so I can use one hand to drive and the other hand to remote control my phone, sometimes scrolling down to the next TikTok video.

I remember in 2019, after watching TikTok for three months, my English listening improved significantly. My level grew from only being able to understand a few words the first time I watched to being able to understand most of the words. Although I could read them as text, I couldn't listen to them the first time, especially at that fast speed. However, after watching more than 10,000 short videos, my brain magically changed.

So, while learning Japanese this time, I am more patient and more observant of my current level and the next level I should achieve.

These are the words from "Stay with Me":

わたし は わたし あなた は あなた と

ゆうべ いってた そんな き も する わ

I can recognize half of the Hiragana, but it is still the next level thing I need to learn.

Watashi wa watashi, anata wa anata to

Yuube itteta sonna ki mo suru wa

This is the English translation of it. This is what I am learning. It is much easier to learn and comprehend. So my current plan is to learn it by listening and recognizing its English translation. The good news is that I can say, I can now recognize much more by listening during my leisure time throughout the week.

I still watch some Japanese videos to learn about Hiragana and Katakana. Doing so makes learning more fun. You can also learn interesting things by mastering Japanese, like their food, and their daily life.

Reflecting on how I learned English over the years has helped me learn Japanese faster and better. Our brains are magical; all you need is patience and never stop thinking, and it will automatically do its job.

The basic elements of a language are simple. For example, all Chinese characters can be spelled as Pinyin, all English words are made of 26 alphabet characters, and all Japanese is built on Hiragana and Katakana. So the first thing we need to do is learn these basic elements fluently. Even though Hiragana may be challenging at first sight, we can start by learning its English translation.

I admire some people on the internet who are fluent in Japanese. Nowadays, the world is more connected, and mastering English is easy. Due to curiosity or influencing environments, people learn a second foreign language. The internet is full of language resources, and they are everywhere. Although my TikTok algorithm shows me English Videos, after searching for some Japanese keywords and watching or listening to 1000 Japanese videos, it now recommends Japanese videos.

Before I started learning Japanese, I wondered why these people learn it. Now I understand that learning one more language is easy for them. Also, once you have mastered English, you may find the internet boring, and so you start learning a new language. Your soul needs another culture to be fulfilled. That is why some people like to move to other countries to live.

I have noticed that more young people in global cities are capable of at least three languages by the age of 18. When I moved from a village in China to a big city at the age of 10, after a few years, I became fluent in Hakka, Mandarin, and Cantonese (less fluent but okay to listen to). They are all Chinese, and two are dialects. The same thing is happening to young people today. When their parents move to new countries or global cities, their kids find it easier to master three languages when they grow up.

To me, it is not just catching up with young people now. It is also that learning new things makes one young again. Why can a kid learn a language, but an adult usually cannot? It is because adults start to lose patience and curiosity. It is because adults are too purpose-driven and too rushed.

The good news is that nowadays, there are tons of tools to help people learn. I have also developed more patience for learning a new language this time. I cherish the feeling when I see tons of Japanese words and think, "What the hell are they talking about?" because I know our brains are magical, and I will soon know them all. The overwhelming time will be short, and I should cherish it.

Chinese Translation by ChatGPT:

两年前，我学习了两周的日语，然后放下了并做了其他事情。现在，我重新开始了学习之旅。我观察到这一次事情进行得更加顺利。我仍然能够识别一些片假名和平假名。我的旅程才刚刚开始，这一次，我没有遵循任何建议，而是使用了一些独特的学习方法。我通过驾车来学习。下班后，我会开车四个小时，一边听日本TikTok或一些日本音乐。因为开车需要耐心，这使我更有耐心。在开车时，你不能开得更快，必须等待前面的车或红绿灯。开车也可能很无聊，所以最好有些事情可以思考。我买了一个遥控器拿在手里，这样我就可以一手开车，一手遥控手机，有时向下滚动到下一个TikTok视频。

我记得在2019年，看了三个月的TikTok后，我的英语听力显著提高了。我能够从最初只能理解几个单词的水平上升到能够理解大部分单词。虽然我可以读它们作为文本，但我第一次听时无法听懂，特别是那么快的速度。然而，在观看了超过10,000个短视频后，我的大脑神奇地改变了。

因此，这一次学习日语时，我更有耐心，更加注意我的当前水平以及我应该达到的下一个水平。

这些是“Stay with Me”歌词：

わたしはわたし　あなたはあなたと

ゆうべいってた　そんなきもするわ

我能够识别一半的平假名，但这仍然是我需要学习的下一个级别的事情。

Watashi wa watashi, anata wa anata to

Yuube itteta sonna ki mo suru wa

这是它的英文翻译。这是我正在学习的东西。这样学习和理解要容易得多。因此，我的当前计划是通过听和识别其英文翻译来学习它。好消息是，我现在可以说，通过整一周闲暇时间的学习后，我能够通过听力识别更多的东西。

我仍然观看一些日语视频来学习平假名和片假名。这样做可以让学习更有趣。通过掌握日语，你也可以学到一些有趣的东西，比如他们的食物和日常生活。

回顾我多年来学习英语的经历，帮助我更快更好地学习日语。我们的大脑是神奇的，你只需要耐心和不断思考，它就会自动完成工作。

语言的基本元素很简单。例如，所有的汉字都可以用拼音拼写，所有的英语单词都由26个字母组成，所有的日语都是建立在平假名和片假名之上的。因此，我们需要流利地掌握这些基本元素。虽然平假名可能一开始有些困难，但我们可以从学习它的英语翻译开始。

我钦佩的一些人，日语也很流利。如今，世界更加紧密，掌握英语很容易。由于好奇心或环境影响，人们学习第二门外语。互联网上充满了语言资源，到处都是。尽管我的TikTok算法向我展示英语视频，但在搜索了一些日语关键词并观看或听了1000个日语视频后，现在它推荐日语视频。

在我开始学习日语之前，我想知道为什么这些人学它。现在我明白了，对他们来说学习另一门语言很容易。此外，一旦你掌握了英语，你可能会觉得互联网很无聊，于是你开始学习一门新语言。你的灵魂需要另一种文化来充实。这也是为什么有些人喜欢移居其他国家生活的原因。

我注意到，在全球化的城市中，越来越多的年轻人在18岁之前就能掌握至少三种语言。当我10岁从中国的一个村庄搬到大城市时，几年后，我就能流利地说客家话、普通话和粤语（不太流利但能听懂）。它们都是中国语言，其中两种是方言。今天的年轻人也正在经历同样的事情。当他们的父母移居到新的国家或全球化城市时，他们的孩子在成长过程中更容易掌握三种语言。

对我来说，不仅仅是跟上现在的年轻人，学习新东西也会让一个人重新变得年轻。为什么孩子可以学一门语言，而成年人通常不能？因为成年人开始失去耐心和好奇心。因为成年人太注重目的，太急躁了。

好消息是，现在有很多工具可以帮助人们学习。这一次，我也对学习新语言更有耐心了。当我看到大量的日语文字时，心里想着“我靠他们在说什么啊？”这种感觉让我很珍惜，因为我知道我们的大脑是神奇的，我很快就会了解它们。这种不适应的时间会很短暂，我应该珍惜它。
