title: "Measuring Blood Pressure"
---

I bought an electronic blood pressure monitor and tested my blood pressure recently.

On my first measurement using my left arm, the systolic pressure was 140mmHg, the diastolic pressure was 90mmHg, and my heart rate was 68bpm.

On the second measurement using my right arm, the systolic pressure was 120mmHg, the diastolic pressure was 80mmHg, and my heart rate was 64bpm.

Using the monitor was an interesting experience. Initially, I had trouble properly wrapping the blood pressure cuff around my arm. I learned that it's not just about putting the cuff on - there's a specific technique to wrapping it correctly.

The proper wrapping technique involves:
1. First wrapping the cuff 360 degrees clockwise around your arm
2. Then wrapping an additional 60 degrees counterclockwise

And we can record the measurement result using the iOS health app.
