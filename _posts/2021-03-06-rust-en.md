 I. Try Rust Programming

Rust is a popular programming language in recent years. In 2006, a Mozilla employee started a personal project, which later gained the company's support and was released as this project in 2010. This project is named Rust. Next, let's run the first Rust program. Go to the official website to see how to get it running.

The official website provides a script:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
``` On Mac, you can also install using Homebrew, the Mac system's package management tool. Run the command:

```shell
brew install rust
``` I use Homebrew here to install Rust. At the installation time, let's continue checking the website.

Next, we see Cargo appearing on the website, which is Rust's build tool and package manager.

The official website states:

[Rust programming language – Install Rust with rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

To install Rust using rustup, add the following repository to your package manager:

```sh
$ curl --proto 'https' --tlsv1.2 --silent --show-error \
    --compressed https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This script will install Rustup and the Rust compiler, as well as set up your `$PATH` environment variable.

Now you can check the Rust installation by running:

```sh
$ rustc --version
```

If the installation was successful, this command should print the Rust compiler version number.

To install a new Rust project, navigate to the desired directory and run:

```sh
$ cargo new project_name
```

Replace "project\_name" with the name of your new project. This command will create a new directory with the given name, and it will contain a basic Rust project structure.

Now you can start coding! To run your project, navigate to the project directory and execute:

```sh
$ cargo run
```

This command will compile your Rust code and run it. You should see the output of your program in the terminal.

For more information about Cargo and its features, visit the [Cargo documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). Tell us how to build, run, and test a Cargo program.

- Build your project with `cargo build`
- Run your project with `cargo run`
- Test your project with `cargo test` Running:

Installing Rust using Homebrew.

The given Chinese text does not contain any direct translation to English, but rather it is a description of an action in English using Chinese characters. The action is to install Rust using Homebrew. The English command to accomplish this is provided in the shell script format.

USAGE:
cargo [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]

OPTIONS:
-V, --version: Print version info and exit
--list: List installed commands
--explain <CODE>: Run `rustc --explain CODE`
-v, --verbose: Use verbose output (-vv very verbose/build.rs output)-q, --quiet: no output to stdout
--color <WHEN>: Coloring: auto, always, never
--frozen: require Cargo.lock and cache to be up-to-date
--locked: require Cargo.lock to be up-to-date
--offline: run without network access
-Z <FLAG>...: unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo (see 'cargo -Z help' for details)
-h, --help: prints help information

Some common cargo commands are (see all commands with --list):
build, b: compile the current package check - Analyze current package for errors, do not build object files
clean - Remove target directory
doc - Build documentation for this package and its dependencies
new - Create a new Cargo package
init - Initialize a new Cargo package in an existing directory
run, r - Run binary or example of local package
test, t - Run tests
bench - Run benchmarks
update - Update dependencies listed in Cargo.lock
search - Search registry for crates- Publish and upload a package to the registry: publish
- Package and upload this package to the registry: publish
- Install a Rust binary. Default location is $HOME/.cargo/bin: install
- Uninstall a Rust binary: uninstall
- See 'cargo help <command>' for more information on a specific command: help

Important commands: build, run. Continue checking the official website documentation:

Let's write a small application with our new Rust development environment. To begin, we'll use Cargo to create a new project for us. In your preferred terminal, run:

cargo new hello-rust This will create a new directory named "hello-rust" with the following files:

- Cargo.toml
- src
  - main.rs

"Cargo.toml" is the manifest file for Rust projects. It contains metadata and dependencies.

- src/main.rs: where we'll write our application code. This tells how to create a project. Next, create.

$ cargo new hello-rust

Created binary (application) `hello-rust` package. We use VSCode to open the project.

main.rs:

[Rust code goes here] I will come to the build and run part later.

Here's the English translation of the given Rust code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Translates to:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

// Function named 'main' with no arguments
// Prints the string "Hello, world!" to the standard output
```: The following error occurred while building:

error: cannot find `Cargo.toml` in `/Users/lzw/ideas/curious-courses/program/run/rust` or any parent directory. Error. Why. This indicates that cargo can only be run in the project's directory. Next, enter the subdirectory and run `cd hello-rust`.

At this point, let's try running it directly:

```shell
$ cargo run
``` All right, succeeded. Outputted string, program started working.
[Translation of the Chinese comment above the command output]

Compiling hello-rust v0.1.0 (/Users/lzw/ideas/curious-courses/program/run/rust/hello-rust)
[Finished in 4.43 seconds with unoptimized and debug information]
[Target(s) compiled successfully]
[Running target/debug/hello-rust]

Hello, world! Try changing the program.

In English code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("{}", 2 + 3);
}
``` After running `cargo`, the following was displayed:
shell> error: format argument must be a string literal
 --> src/main.rs:2:14
 |
2 | println!(2+3);
 |--------------^-----^
 | | |
 | | missing | string literal
 | |
 | println!("{}", 2+3);

Suggestion: Replace `println!(2+3);` with `println!("{}", 2+3);` to include a string literal for formatting. error: aborting due to previous error
error: could not compile "hello-rust"

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.

Translation:

error: aborting due to previous error
error: failed to compile "hello-rust"

For more information, run the command again with --verbose. I haven't learned any Rust syntax yet. Based on our intuition, we modified the code and made an error. The error message is good, it already tells us how to fix it.

English translation:

I have not learned any Rust syntax yet. Based on our intuition, we modified the code and made an error. The error message is good, it already tells us how to fix it.

Without Chinese characters or punctuation:

I have not learned any Rust syntax yet. Based on our intuition, we modified the code and made an error. The error message is good. It already tells us how to fix it.

Regarding the Rust code provided, the error message would depend on the specific error encountered during compilation. However, assuming a common error like a missing semicolon, the corrected code would look like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("{}", 2 + 3);
}
``` This time it's correct, indeed outputted 5.

By the way, what about build.

```

In English, the Chinese text translates to:

This time it's correct, indeed outputted 5.
Anyway, how about build. Why do we need build. It's because we might just want to generate an executable, without running it. Maybe for large programs, running is time-consuming. Maybe we want to generate locally and then transfer to a remote server to run.

$ cargo build
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s. We have gotten the Rust program running. Next, we will be familiarizing ourselves with more Rust language syntax to find the corresponding symbolic representations for the variables, functions, function calls, and expressions discussed in "Computational Thinking with Scratch."
