title: "What Problems Do Bifocals Have?"
---

Bifocals have two different optical powers: one for the upper segment and one for the lower segment. They typically have a significant difference in optical power between these two segments of the lens.

The upper segment is for distance vision, and the lower segment is for near vision. The issue with bifocals is that when you look at a blackboard and use a computer, you use the distance vision part, which is the upper part of your eyeglasses.

So when you use a computer, you end up looking straight ahead as if you are looking at distant objects. However, you actually want to look at the near computer screen. Therefore, using the upper part for distance vision and the lower part for near vision can be problematic.

I think there isn't a perfect pair of bifocals that allows your eyes to see exactly what you want to see clearly. It might be better to adjust to your normal work routines by preparing two or three pairs of eyeglasses to see things clearly. This way, you might be able to reverse your myopia over time.
