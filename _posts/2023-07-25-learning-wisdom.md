### Foreword

My teacher Yin Wang wrote an essay with a similar title in 2019. You could check it out http://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2019/07/12/learning-philosophy. I read it probably 30 times in these 4 years and recommend it to friends for probably the same times. Besides sharing it by direct messages, I also share it on the social network several times. You could know how I love this essay and am beneficial from this. 

Yin Wang joined 3 PhD programs at Tsinghua University, Cornell University and Indiana University Bloomington. And in these years, he shared a lot on Weibo and his blog. I dropped out of a top university in Chinese before. Now, it is 2023, so in these 4 years, I can say that I took my PhD program online and was mentored by him. He taught me every day with new knowledge. The knowledge is precious because he thought out them and few people in the world knew it.

Let me share more YinWang's website:

I will introduce him more in the future. Now let's focus on the discussion about the wisdom of learning. 

### Yin Wang's Essay

Let me pick out some paragraphs from that essay. 

> Most people learn knowledge from schools, books, and literature, ending up with a pile of "dead knowledge." It's straightforward to test whether knowledge is dead or not. If you encounter a completely new problem but can't apply that knowledge to solve it, then that knowledge is likely dead.

> After tracing back to its origins, you will discover that the creators of this knowledge went through hundreds and thousands of errors. It's like Thomas Edison inventing the lightbulb, undergoing thousands of failed experiments. The creators of knowledge publish their final successful results in literature, and that's what you read. You may think you have obtained the most valuable treasure, but the most valuable treasure remains unseen. The lessons and experiences gained by the authors from those hundreds and thousands of failures are the most precious. However, no one ever writes and publishes their failures.

> Living knowledge must be created by oneself and requires numerous failures. Without going through failures, it is impossible to acquire living knowledge.

> When reading a book, don't always try to read it from cover to cover. If you find a topic overwhelming, the best approach is to set aside that book and seek simpler explanations of the same subject. These resources can come from the internet, other books, or even people around you. By keeping multiple sources like these, you can apply the same "breadth-first" search to any topic, increasing your chances of gaining a deeper understanding.

> Chinese children start learning English from a young age, but when it comes to critical moments, they rarely use it. I don't reject reading Chinese content, but I suggest not solely relying on it. For every matter, one should also refer to information in English and analyze from multiple perspectives before making decisions. This applies to both daily life choices and the pursuit of professional knowledge. When encountering the same subject, it's advisable to search for its English equivalent when reading in Chinese. By comparing various sources, you are more likely to obtain accurate information.

The essay is so good that it is full of these insights about learning. I have to stop myself to copy more and sharing here. Otherwise, most of my content will be from his essay. So there will be no points for me to write my wisdom of learning. I can just tell people to check out his. 

### Learning is Hard

Because everyone's experience is different, everyone has his learning way. So I have my learning way too. Some might be the same as others, some might be my own. And Even regarding some learning ways, I can say few people in the world will do the same as me. 

One reason is that in this fast-growing technology world, new ideas are just a lot on the Internet. One is able to think of the idea few people had thought about, surely one is able to think of the new learning way few people had tried. 

Everyone is born to learn. As a child, we don't know we are learning, we just play. But we learn things. So learning ability is actually innate. Why we would lose it when we grow up? I was born in 1995. In my observation, in primary school, most of the kids like school. It is funny and new. And then in junior middle school, some students start to dislike it and choose to drop out. And in a big province with 100 million population in China, Guangdong here, in 2013, probably only 600k in 1 million will take the National College Entrance Examination. So we got 40% of students who couldn't make it from primary school to the college entrance exam. It is about 12 years. 

We have to admit anything we can insist on for 12 years is hard, so including the school education. I was a top student in those 12 years. And I chose to drop out after the first year of my college. I became a bad student or a bad young person. I got my two feelings in my life. 

Fortunately enough, I met good companies and good people in my life who can tolerate my dropout and give me good jobs. So finally, I cured my dropout and lived well in this society. However, many of my classmates who drop out are not, especially if they are grown up in villages instead of the big cities. 

Another problem is that even for those undergrads in the big cities, besides some hot industries, like information and finance, people don't earn enough of what they should get. 

I have worked as a contractor engineer for two big global companies. I went to the USA 2 times. I have some Hong Kong and Singapore colleagues. The gap between the wealthy and the poor I have seen always astonishes my eyes.

Everyone knows this. I don't need to point out the problem to discourage people again. When we see carefully, it has some positive good aspects of this society. You will never get hungry. You can always rent a small room in the cities or towns to watch short videos though besides making a basic living, you don't have money to do other things. 

So I have to share my solution for those people who wants to have a better life, who become dropout student in a year when taking a primary school or university. My solution is learning. 

### Hobby Way

Learning is actually quite simple when you do it right. We should treat learning as a hobby instead of a serious endeavor. 

When I was probably 7 years old, taking the first year of my primary school education in a village in China, my father give me some Olympiad math books when he come back to the village to spend the Spring Festival with family members. 

The books have some simple math questions like adjusting the matches to make the equations correct. I liked it at that time. I probably played such simple math games 30 times a year, each time for 1 or 2 hours. They are funnier than my textbooks. 

This play attitude in learning is actually quite essential if you want to learn something. Actually, I have to say if we forget what we want to learn, we just play, it is better. So we don't need to insist, we just play and have fun.

That's why I always find that I was doing better in my hobbies than in my daily work. Now my daily work should be learning the papers and code of machine learning, however, I find that I still get distracted by my Japanese learning. 

For hobbies, you won't give yourself a target. It is a hobby. We don't do it for exams, money or to impress others. We do it just for fun. 

For the last several months, I spent my time learning cloud computing in my daily work.  And I still have probably 6 hours in a day. In these 6 hours, I probably listen to Japanese music and short videos for 5 hours. And actually, I just did machine learning for about 1 hour a day on average. 

So it shouldn't be astounding for me to find that I am making more progress in Japanese than in machine learning. Actually, I was quite astounding. Because what I want is to switch my cloud computing job to a machine learning engineer job. Because machine learning is hot now and the companies doing it pay well. 

Even now, I am listening to wonderful Japanese music while writing this essay. I am not doing anything about machine learning. 

The common sense of learning is quite simple. You need to put 1000 or more hours into one topic, then you will be good at it. The hard thing is to insist. It is really hard to do anything for a long time you don't like in your deep heart. 

In retrospect, in my school, I did better in programming than in daily courses. In my first year in school, I probably go to classrooms just 10 times. I did much better in my mobile application programming than in traditional computer science courses at universities in China. 

I just notice that I will do better in my own thing. The traditional computer science courses are not my own things. However, mobile application programming is my own thing. I take ownership of what I love. So I really love that in my heart and I want to do well. 

And in my first job, I did mobile application programming for 1.5 years. I was quite happy overall. And then I got distracted by startup things. Then I did startup with my friends for half a year and then I did it by myself for 3 years. 

In retrospect, I was quite happy for about 4 years though I needed to do marketing and programming all by myself. And after around 2 years doing freelancing, 

Hoppy is a magical word. We probably should use it in other places to guide our life. Like the best wife is a hobby wife. If the other one has the same hobbies as us, what they love deeply in their heart is the same as ours, that person might be the right person to be our life mate. People have different hobbies. It might better say that the people who have actually boldness to pursue their hobbies regardless of money or the whole world, are the ones we should be with. 

Like we should only treat our job as a hobby. We should only do a hobby job. We won't force ourselves to do things we don't like. And we should make more hobby friends and make more conversations about our hobbies. We should treat every matter as hobbies,  and treat everyone as hobby friends. 

It is probably better to discuss hobbies with friends instead of work or daily boring life. 

I learned enough to select most jobs I wanted. I should find a hobby job instead of that earned most money or whatever. The way how we earn money is much more important than how much money we earn. 

So there is a recipe to do any job well. Try to treat it as a hobby job. There is a famous quote, do what you love, love what you do. Actually, I find it is easier to change one thing to a hobby nowadays. To my way, it is to listen to experts in that area all day long for weeks. The real experts in one topic are always sharing that topic happily. If they don't like it most, they won't learn the most. 

## Detailed Ways

Now we have a general principle to learn anything, treat learning them as a hobby. How about our detailed ways to learn? 

When I prepare for the information competitions in high school, I read books and did programming on the computer. Learning by actual doing is important. Tony Fedell said so in the Lex Fridman Podcast. 

There is no magic in the top talent and top genius in the world. They just do too much and think too much. Their learning ways are quite similar to the kids. The kids try to walk again and again and fall down often, and then one day they can walk.

My first programming language is Pascal. I don't know a bit about its grammar when I just entered junior middle school. I tried it again and again on the computer. And then one day in the third year of my junior middle school, I was just able to write 100 lines of Pascal code for an hour to solve some simple programming questions. 

And then in the next half year of my third year in junior middle school, I switched my programming language to C. And then one day in the first year of high school, I just can do similar coding using C programming with that using Pascal programming language. And then in my first year at a top university in China, I found that I can beat down the high-grade ones in programming. Because I learn more programming in middle school they learn programming at the university. Just like that among the young people in China, my English is probably quite good even to the people who majored in English at university. Because I spend more time using English than them. 

I have probably written 300k words in the last year including my daily conversation with colleagues in the global company, and my leisure writing of 20 essays in my blog. I usually forget that I am learning English. I just use them in my life, 10 hours a day using them. And then one day, I found that I use them even more than my native language. My English level is almost half capable of my Chinese level. 

And regarding English learning, I used a lot of ways to learn. The language is just everywhere. I used Grammarly to correct my grammar. I used ChatGPT to translate my English essay and often found that my English expression has some problem so it leads to translation errors. I did leisure driving in my city while listening to English lectures. I probably did the 20000 kilometers of English learning in this way.
