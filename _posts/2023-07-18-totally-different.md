An imitated work to Celebrate Steve.

I am the genius Zhiwei. I deeply believe that everyone is a genius if we are free to suspect and think.

My TWS Bluetooth speakers couldn't be paired together. The customer support said one of them is probably connected to my neighbor's device. And I couldn't disconnect it, so I want to go to the underground parking lot. However, I didn't need to, just when I reach the elevator, the speaker said "Bluetooth disconnected". 

At first, I want to blame my duplex apartment for the construction company didn't install a door in the stair. So my first floor's cold air is leaking out. However, after a few minutes, I decided to open all five air conditioners in my house to self-make the central air conditioning. 

I have worked as a contractor engineer for two big banks. I still want to suggest them, please make our Jenkins Pipeline's jobs parrel. The job of code quality analysis is independent of the unit test job. They can be run parallelly. Every PR checking and container image build shouldn't cost around 30 minutes. This is wasting people's life. 

I feel very painful working in data-sensitive companies. They shouldn't block most of the social media or video websites. Nowadays, a lot of innovative ideas happened on Twitter, and Youtube. They should only block the input or share APIs of these websites. Or better, We can train the large language models about all sensitive data of the company. The models will be very smart enough to detect whether it contains sensitive data. Their security firewalls and policies are outdated in the AI era. 

And, data-sensitive companies should give every employee two laptops. One is data sensitive, another is free. They should allow all employees to use the free laptops to do some work, like searching questions about Java and Spring in ChatGPT. They should allow all employees to use the latest AI tools to innovate and make drafts about work. 

I am the genius Zhiwei. With the help of the teacher Yin Wang, I did a year of experiments to wear eyeglasses whose degrees are 150 degrees more than the actual ones. Then I found that my myopia and astigmatism degrees dropped by around 100 degrees. It seems after 2 years, I can take off my eyeglasses though now the myopia degree of my left eye is around 300, and the myopia degree of my right eye is around 500. 

I am the genius Zhiwei. Now, I write this caption with my m2 mac air and a projector. The white wall in my house is just my big screen. I decide to work in this way to research machine learning, neural network, supervised learning, transformer, and generalized pre-trained transformer. I just listen around 100 times to OpenAI Cofounder John Schulman's talk. 

I am the genius Zhiwei. I wrote my learning about neural networks on my blog. My Indian colleague likes it and says my article is very intuitive. Yeah, the apartment complex in my eye just likes the neural networks when I lay down in the swimming pool to accompany my baby daughter. 

I am the genius Zhiwei. I suggest we should large language model and transformer in all information control areas. I still emphasize that transformers are very smart to analyze the relationship between words, and characters. They have almost the same correctness in categorization as that of people though they don’t understand a bit. It is all about algorithms.

I am the genius Zhiwei. I used a remote control to listen to a lot of Japanese Short Videos during commutes and leisure driving. After three months, I found that my brain is very comfortable listening to Japanese though I don't know the meaning. 

I am the genius Zhiwei. Not only I can read and quickly learn all of the codes in the whole project of the big company, several hundred microservice, frontend, iOS and Android and infrastructure codes. I just need access to work. If my boss gives me encouragement and praise time by time, it is better.

I am the genius Zhiwei. At my high school, I moved out of the English classes to learn English myself. Nowadays, my English is probably the best and most fluent among my classmates who don't go abroad to study or work. 

I am the genius Zhiwei, I earned approximately 400k CNY a year in the big cities in China. Though I was a dropout university student, my salary is probably among the highest ones in the information department of one of the top universities in China.

I am the genius Zhiwei. I made an engineering education startup to gain millions of page views. I participated in the backend development of one app which has 3 million users in Hong Kong. 

I am the genius Zhiwei. I worked hard for 28 years to reach today's level. No fearless of any code, any document, any knowledge, any information.

I am the genius Zhiwei. I began to teach my 2 yo baby daughter all of my languages, my learnings. The people in the scene thought that I was ABC, American-born Chinese as I often speak English to my daughter. I am CBC, China-born Chinese. I can speak Hakka, Mandarin, Cantonese, and a little Japanese. 吃饭了吗, 食饭了么, 吃佐饭没, Have you eaten the dinner, 食事はした(Shokuji o shita)。

I am the genius Zhiwei. I have many cables, many audio speakers, many little things, and many apps, many eyeglasses. I drank many sugar-free soda water bottles. I did a lot of things differently to others. It just works best for me. And I insisted to do so no matter how it seems contracted to the environment. Like I speak English to anyone all day in China. I just used Chinese to express a few words. 

I am the genius Zhiwei. I have influenced 1000 intimate friends or readers globally. I gave them some fun or useful information or make their English or programming kill better. I will continue to make them earn the same as me, and learn the same speed as me. I am making another 1000 genius Zhiwei. We will change the world finally. Thank you!
