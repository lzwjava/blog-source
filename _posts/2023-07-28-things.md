Quick share:

1. For recent clues, Zhiwei's ability now is able to get a job of 600k a year in China, or even more.
2. Japanese seems so easy. Zhiwei is going to write or speak Japanese a lot after receiving tons of input in 4 months.
3. Yin Wang is Zhiwei's best teacher and teaches everything to Zhiwei. Strongly recommend following his Weibo or reading his blog. 
4. Learning seems so easy to Zhiwei's brain now. Earning big money seems doable.
5. Zhiwei will buy more products to learn and go to more places to learn.

### Thoughts

I am 28 years old now. My life experience is rich to the standard of most of the young people of the same age as me in China. Even in the global standard, my life experience should be a little rich. I am lucky to born in this Internet area. The news ideas, things, and places just come into my mind. Then one day, you want to have the things you don't have or go to the places you haven't been to.

I have a 2 year old daughter now. Our couple will bring up her to explore this wonderful world. I dropped out of a top university in China to pursue the life I want to in 2014. Now 9 years passed. I bought the above things or went to the above places with the money I earned except for the house. My wife and I both owned our house. And my parents gave us around half a million CNY for a down payment on the house. 

I learned a lot by using these things or staying in these places in my life. So I will encourage my daughter to use wonderful things human beings ever created, the natural places nature created, and buildings human beings created in this world. 

And I will pursue bigger success to buy more things or enjoy more places too. I am greedy. But I really want to have a life like Alibaba founder Jack Ma or Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. We just lived one time. We enjoy the world through our honest labor. It is totally ethical. 

And I created value for others to earn some money. I have worked as a software engineer or as a startup founder to make others' life better. However, others do more for me than I do for others. 

And, I start to help human beings and the next generations with my discovery. I have shared a lot about my language study method with friends around me. I shared the method to help me cure my myopia in natural ways. Please check out my essay "How I Wear the Eyeglasses With 150 Degrees Less Than the Actual to Reduce Myopia".

### Third Language

Not having a basic fluency in the third language will limit my freedom to explore the world. So this is why I still learn Japanese for 4 hours in the last months every day. And it is very easy for me to learn new langauge. I just do some leisure driving to listen to the sound of Japanese short videos. And I just listen to some nice Japanese music when I am coding or writing. Then when I am comfortable listening to the Japanese language, then I find that it is very easy to learn the written symbols. When I see the symbols, the sound just appears in my mind.

As there are many friends I have in China who are still not able to use English fluently, I want to give them the confidence to master English. It is so easy. And once you master English, you have a new world. You will find that you want to go to English countries to work or study. It seems so easy though there are some administration processes we need to walk through.

I have observed that in my 2 years of global corporate life. When I learned a lot about their LinkedIn pages, a lot of my colleagues switched countries to work and stay once or several times. And Some colleagues left their current company to go to another countries. It was just happening to my eyes.

And I start to buy more global products. I bought the Apple TV and Fire TV. I made my home more international. And I found that the digital lives of the USA and the China are richest in the world. So I really have an amazing digital life. 

So if I am ok to use Japanese fluently, it is just like I was born in Japan again, I couldn't imagine how my third life will be. I was born in 1995 in China. And I was born in 2016 in the USA. This was the first time I went there. And now I feel I was just like 2 yo Japanese kid. So I was born in 2023 in Japan.

I can feel that Japanese is much easier for me to learn than English was to me. I want to learn a new language every year. It just spends me 2 hours every day. It won't affect my daily work. Even though sometimes it seems to affect my daily work, my brain become sharper while learning the new language, and I use that same brain to work, so I can feel that learning new languages will help a lot my work.

### Final

I surely will teach all these to my daughter. I couldn't imagine how her life will be. The brain we have is so powerful. Maybe my daughter won't like learning like I, so I write down this for other kids to see. The Y Combinator founder Paul Graham taught me a lot when I was in high school. And I became so strong after 10 years. Magic happens.

And I am teaching other kids or students who are younger than me. Surely, the magic will happen again.
