### Thoughts

I am 28 years old now. My life experience is richful to the standard of the young people with the same age as me in China. Even in the global standard, my life experience should be a little richful. I am lucky to born in this Internet area. The news ideas, things and places are just come into my mind. Then one day, you want to have the things you don't have or go to the places you haven't been to. 

I have a 2 years old daughter now. Our couple will bring up her to explore this wonderful world. I dropped out from a top university from China to pursue the life I want to in 2014. Now 9 years passed. I bought above things or went to above places with the money I earned except the house. My wife and me both owned our house. And my parents gave us around half a million CNY for a down payment on the house. 

I learned a lot with using these things or staying in these places in my life. So I will encourage my daughter to use wonderful things human beings ever created, the natural places and buildings human beings created in this world. 

And I will pursue the bigger success to buy more things or enjoy more places too. I am greedy. But I really to want to have a life Alibaba founder Jack Ma or Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have. We just lived one time. We enjoy the world by our honest labor. It is totally ethical.
