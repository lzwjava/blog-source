 I used to search for English solutions to programming issues on Google in 2014, but I struggled due to my slow reading speed and frequent dictionary usage. I felt overwhelmed and switched to Chinese web pages. At that point, I preferred reading in Chinese whenever possible. However, over the past six years, my reading habits have changed, and I now only read English content when it's not available in Chinese. I spend my free time in the English-speaking world, watching American TV shows without subtitles and browsing TikTok videos. Despite my efforts, my English proficiency is still not as strong as my Chinese, which is roughly half as good. I have found the answer to the question of how to reach the level of a native English speaker. Over the past two years, my English proficiency has significantly improved, particularly during the second half of 2019. Reflecting on this progress, I believe I could have been at this level earlier if I had put in the same effort in 2015-2016. With dedication and time, I can now utilize English resources to tackle problems I once gave up on. This advancement enables me to read professional books and broaden my horizons. In today's digital age, I've discovered that we can simulate living in English-speaking countries without leaving home. People in English-speaking countries are similar to us; they spend most of their time on phones and computers, using the internet. Once we learn how to access the internet freely, we can enter their world too.

I am sharing these insights and experiences as if I were speaking to my younger self, as well as high school and college students, and anyone interested in self-studying English. In my previous article on "The Journey of Learning English," I discussed my experiences learning English over the years. Here, I want to add some recent reflections.

Just like with any other subject, the most crucial aspect is finding a method you enjoy and sticking with it. If you love English songs, start by learning their lyrics, word by word, and understanding their meanings. Then, listen to the songs and write down the lyrics with a pen or on your computer. If this seems challenging, that's okay; move on to learning another song. Learn many songs, maybe a hundred of your favorites. Trust me, once you've learned a hundred songs, your brain will be different. You'll find that you can understand similar lyrics and songs much easier. To continue improving your English to a native-like level, learn another hundred songs, but this time, switch to different topics and genres, from love songs to country music.

If you enjoy quotes, find a hundred inspiring quotes, especially from people you admire. Learn them one by one, look up words in the dictionary, and understand their meanings. If you admire certain foreign personalities, follow them on Twitter, read their tweets one by one, and look up unfamiliar words. If you like playing games and also want to learn English, try playing English-language games. Find a hundred games to play. If you love watching American TV shows, try watching them without subtitles. Initially, it might be challenging to understand, but as you continue watching, you'll gradually notice that you can understand more. If watching without subtitles is too difficult, try using English subtitles. Platforms like Netflix and YouTube offer subtitle options easily. After watching a hundred episodes of TV shows or documentaries, you'll realize that your English listening skills have improved significantly. If you continue this for a couple of months, you'll find that you can't go back to your previous level. Language learning is fascinating; once you understand something, you won't forget it.

At present, in my daily life as a freelancer, I spend a considerable amount of time enhancing my English. I read a couple of chapters on Kindle, browse TikTok for short videos, watch TV shows and documentaries on Netflix, and explore various content on YouTube. I do whatever interests me at the moment. My only requirement for myself is that since I'm choosing content I enjoy, I should focus and understand every sentence carefully. I have watched over 40,000 TikTok videos and liked approximately 10,000 of them. I have watched around 100 documentaries and movies on Netflix. I have read over 100 English blog articles and 15 English books. I accomplished this progress mainly during the second half of 2019, dedicating around eight hours per day, five days a week. My primary focus was on enhancing my listening and reading skills.

It's crucial not to force yourself to learn. Persistence can be painful. Find the content and methods that you enjoy the most and stick with them. Watching international TikTok videos is effortless and doesn't require persistence. If you find certain materials challenging, look for easier ones to learn from. Once you've mastered the easy ones, move on to slightly more complex content. Language is omnipresent, and there's an abundance of topics and expressions to explore.

Reflect on how you learned Chinese. You didn't learn it by studying grammar and doing exercises; instead, you watched many martial arts movies and TV shows before attending school. You engaged in simple conversations with your parents before starting school. Approach learning English in the same way.

In high school, even after learning English, our listening and reading skills were still weak. In exam-focused learning, we might not have been efficient in our studies. Besides exams, did we take the initiative to learn on our own? Probably not. In the past, learning resources were limited, with only textbooks and exercises like "New Concept English" and language learning tapes. In elementary school, we only occasionally listened to audio tapes in class. In middle school, we had around 15 minutes of listening practice before evening self-study.

Despite the inconvenience of accessing the internet, we now have abundant resources available for self-learning. The internet provides us with ample material for learning English.1. Learning anything is akin to learning English. Trust in the power of time and immerse yourself in the most fundamental knowledge. If your goal is to learn physics, initiate with a sequence of basic experiments. For programming, commence with graphical programming. To enhance your drawing abilities, begin by sketching simple objects. Make learning an engaging experience; even studying English via TikTok is genuinely entertaining and habit-forming.

2. When we transform learning into a game, our concentration intensifies, and cognitive processes become enjoyable. Should you encounter difficulties in comprehension, seek out simpler learning materials. English children's books and animated films for children serve as exceptional resources.

3. Regarding the encouragement of high school, college students, and those eager to learn English, I'd like to conclude with a memorable yet slightly exaggerated statement: Mastering English like a native is truly effortless and delightful.
