title: "The discussion regarding astigmatism when the eyeballs reverse to the normal position"
---

Zhiwei: By your method, I reduced 75 degrees a year in my right eye and 50 degrees in my left eye. [How I Wear Eyeglasses With 150 Degrees Less Than the Actual to Reduce Myopia](./eyes) Also I may find that as myopia gets deeper, the faster it may recover at first. Like machine learning, it learns fast at first and then slowly. Please see the last paragraph. That means when my right eye goes down to 400 degrees, it may also decrease by 50 degrees a year instead of continuing to be 75 degrees.

Yin: Thank you, it seems the effect is quite good. Actually, the reduced degrees should be added with the astigmatism conversion degrees because astigmatism is also a measure of curved refractive power and should not be disregarded. Dividing the astigmatism degrees by 2 is roughly equivalent to the reduction in myopia degrees.

So, if your left eye's myopia is reduced by 50 degrees and astigmatism is reduced by 100 degrees (which is equivalent to a reduction of 50 degrees of myopia), the left eye is considered to have been reduced by 100 degrees. The right eye is similar, reduced by 75 degrees plus 50/2 = 100 degrees.


Zhiwei: Alright, I roughly understand. It's interesting. I will pay attention during my next eye examination.

Yin: Also, you have more astigmatism, which is probably why the astigmatism is reduced so much. I suspect it is when the astigmatism was created and reversing it back is probably the same point in time to reduce it back.


Zhiwei: Oh, I see. So, if I understand correctly, during the process of eyeball deformation, initially the degree of myopia increases, then astigmatism starts to develop, followed by both the degree of myopia and astigmatism increasing. Eventually, the astigmatism stabilizes while the degree of myopia continues to progress. This is a rough hypothesis about the evolution of myopia degree and astigmatism. The reversal process might follow a similar pattern, which explains why my astigmatism remained stable in the first half of the year and started changing in the second half.

Yin: I feel that because the specific shape of each person's eye is different, the process of deformation is sometimes a regular change, which becomes a uniform "myopia". Sometimes irregular, it becomes astigmatism. Astigmatism is a columnar lens, like the side of a wine bottle.

That's why you calculate the reduction by converting astigmatism into astigmatism, so you actually lose about 100 degrees in both eyes.


Zhiwei: Okay, thank you, teacher. I understand a bit. I'll take a closer look at your article and the references at the end of the day.
