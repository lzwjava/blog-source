 I. Intro

Today we'll discuss "Learn By Doing." This concept is crucial. Learning is important. But the importance of how to learn is even more significant. I've found that creating things, doing while learning, is the best way to go. For instance, if I want to learn Android development, I should genuinely practice Android development, undertaking one challenging project after another.

II. Paul Graham on Computer Science Students' Lives

Paul Graham talks about how computer science students live. Solving numerous complex problems. Firstly, dealing with these challenges from start to finish allows learning a multitude of things. For example, creating a challenging project, like developing a WeChat client. If you dedicate yourself to it, you should be able to handle image processing with PS by the end, and understand various aspects of Android. If you don't use third-party push services, you can even write a real-time communication server, learning even more.

III. Understanding a Book vs. Mastering a Skill

Reading a book leaves you with a general understanding. But it's far from enough. After finishing "Crazy Android" by Bob Sutor, I felt that I knew quite a bit about Android programming, having a good grasp of the basics. It took me approximately 10 days to read through several hundred pages. However, it took me 4 months to fully master the knowledge, having worked on several small projects and one larger project. I merely grasp the knowledge from reading books, which is far from sufficient. Reading is superficial. After all, since I only spent ten days reading, it's not that I spent a lot of time on it.

I thought about it, maybe most of the time in high school education, junior high education, and elementary education is being wasted. These are all based on textbook education.

Last time I discussed with my grandfather how calcium hydroxide is fixed on the wall. To be honest, I'm not clear about it now. Did CaO and O2 form CaCO3? Then CaCO3 is a solid and quite hard. In life, I can't distinguish between CaO and CaCO3, although I can balance them, and through practice and doing problems, I can know what they can transform into and what properties they have. However, I quickly forget it. I've been more than a year and a half since the college entrance exam, and the knowledge I can actively recall is not much. I scored 590 on the college entrance exam, and if I took it again right away, would I get 300?

Fortunately, I spent three years in high school and studied algorithms and programming for a while. I didn't spend all my time playing a boring game of books and exams on paper.

Unfortunately, at that time, I didn't study programming well enough.Although learning materialized languages such as Chinese, Spanish, English has honed me for countless perfects, training my patience and perseverance. However, its drawbacks are apparent - it makes learning feel painful, knowledge seem mundane, and everything is for the sake of rankings and high scores. It further influences one's innate interests and curiosity, making one concerned about rankings even on the path to programming. One no longer enjoys the joy of learning for its own sake.

TJ (Vision Media) stated, I have never gone to school, and I have never read books. I learned programming by looking at other people's code and was always curious, always wanting to understand why.

Paul Graham said, ambitious adults concentrate their curiosity in a small domain.

The more complex the knowledge, the less it can be driven by fame or self-discipline to learn, and can only rely on spontaneous curiosity.

Since childhood, I have acquired knowledge more for the sake of fame, for the sake of rankings, and to be better than others. I crave external validation. Of course, I also have a liking for programming. I'm driven by my core, I'm still not as good as some friends. They're amazing, around the same age, sophomores or 20 years old, one of them writes compilers in their free time and does well at outsourcing companies, another friend has two companies, full-time job for backend development, and has classmates from Tsinghua University who have won various awards.

It's obvious that I can feel a big gap. It's not that they're earlier starters or anything, but their efficiency is high and they spend more time than I do every day.

Due to the pressure of peers of the same age, the motivation to be better than them is huge. I must admit that my colleagues are also amazing. But subconsciously, I feel they're older, maybe I'll be like them when I'm their age. Thinking about it, there's nothing more.

Therefore, we should try to meet and get to know people around our age who are better than us. It's harsh, but the results are good. As long as you bravely face all challenges, don't give up on yourself, notice the gap, and work hard silently, the results will be excellent.

There might be more benefits. Since they're amazing, more talented, more skilled in some area, they're more likely to be people who truly love that thing. They're more likely to be passionate about programming. Therefore, they have a positive influence on us and let us experience the joy of programming. I admit, I invested time in programming because it was my job and I had to report something to my boss, because I felt I was not good enough and might miss the opportunity, and because I had a dream to become a programming expert and start a full-stack business. But since I invested, I quickly felt the joy of creating something. The sense of accomplishment from solving one problem after another.

Starting to work on it, I learned knowledge more effectively, and it was more enjoyable.
