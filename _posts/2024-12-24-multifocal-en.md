After trying a pair of multifocal lenses for a few minutes, I found them to be quite good. They suit my needs perfectly and cost around 130 CNY.

I used the above data to customize a pair of multifocal progressive lenses. I can use the near vision part when using my mobile phone and the far vision part when working on my computer.

Actually, you can adjust which part you use for near or far vision by moving your gaze up or down the lenses. While it's possible to make small adjustments, it can feel unusual or uncomfortable to adjust too much.

I'll use them for a few more days to see how they feel.

When I received the eyeglasses, I could see the yellow markings on the lens.

Customer support says,

> The yellow markings on the lens are painted on for your reference. For distance viewing, look through the upper circle, and for near viewing, look through the lower circle with your eyes slightly lowered. These markings can be wiped off. After adapting for two days, you can apply clear tape to the front of the lens and peel it off to remove the yellow line. Then, clean the lens with a lens cleaner. You can also clean it with alcohol and cologne.

And SP and WV mean the following, according to Mistral:

> In the context of multifocal progressive lenses, the abbreviations "SP" and "WV" typically refer to specific measurements or features of the lenses. Here's what they usually mean:
>
> 1. **SP (Segment Height or Segment Position)**: This refers to the vertical position of the optical center of the near vision zone (the segment) from the bottom of the lens. It's important for ensuring that the wearer can see clearly at near distances when looking down.
>
> 2. **WV (Working Distance for Vision)**: This term is less commonly used in progressive lenses, but it can refer to the effective working distance or the length of the progressive corridor, which is the area of the lens where the power gradually changes from distance to near vision.
>
> These measurements are crucial for fitting progressive lenses to ensure optimal visual comfort and performance for the wearer. Always consult with an eyecare professional for the most accurate and personalized information.
