title: "To the 10 yo's me: how to become an information genius (revised by ChatGPT)"
---

I am now 28 years old, and looking back, being 10 years old feels like it was just yesterday. It was around September of 2004 when I left a village in Guangdong and came to Guangzhou, a big city in China. I was actually born in January 1995, so technically I should have been 9 years old. But saying I was 10 years old is more convenient. That year was special to me because it was when I first encountered a computer at my father's workplace. It was a building monitoring tunnels, and inside, computers displayed videos captured by CCTV cameras showing the traffic inside the tunnels.

At that time, I couldn't imagine what it would be like to grow up and become a father like my own. I probably never even considered that question when I was young. Now, 18 years have passed, and it's already 2023. Soon, it will be history.

There are so many things I would like to share with my 10-year-old self, but it's challenging to fit them all into one article. However, one thing I particularly want to convey is how to become an information genius.

After my first encounter with a computer, like many other primary school students, I enjoyed playing games. At the age of 13, in 2008, I started participating in the National Olympiad in Informatics at the provincial level. By 2011, I made it to the second round, competing against around 360 top students in Guangdong Province, which has a population of approximately 100 million. Unfortunately, luck was not on my side, and I didn't even receive the third prize. The third prize was typically awarded to the top 200 students based on scores, so my ranking was around 300.

Since then, my journey has taken me to university, dropping out, working at a startup, and even founding my own startup. Currently, I work as a full-stack engineer for a global bank through a contractor arrangement.

Over the past year, I've had numerous moments where I feel like an information genius. When I seek confirmation from colleagues, they acknowledge that I sometimes approach tasks with innovative methods. When I answer questions from newly joined Chinese engineers, they express frustrations about the challenges of working in a global company, such as language barriers, access permissions, overwhelming information, lack of mentors, and demanding bosses.

In fact, my initial experience working at a large bank in Singapore in 2022 was not great. However, my boss was kind enough to transfer me to a different team, where I excelled. My new boss praised my performance among the four or five Chinese engineers in the team.

As of June 2023, I've continued to shine not only among my Chinese teammates but also among my Hong Kong teammates. My boss is pleased to see my eagerness to learn. Although I still have much to learn from my boss and brilliant colleagues, I celebrate these small successes.

One of my hobbies is updating my resume and the skills listed in it. Here are the skills I have gained experience in:

- Over 5 years of experience: Chinese, English, Java, Spring, Algorithms, TDD, Linux, Windows, MacOS, Writing, Databases, Redis.
- 3 to 5 years of experience: C++, iOS, Android, Vue, HTML, CSS, DevOps, Cantonese, Alibaba Cloud.
- 1 to 3 years of experience: Product Management, PHP, C++, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, Python, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Kafka, Networking, RTMP streaming, Pascal.
- Less than 1 year of experience: Hardware, Go, Ruby, Big Data, Machine Learning, Japanese, AWS, ChatGPT, Elasticsearch.

As you can see

, my focus is quite broad. However, upon closer examination, all these skills revolve around the realm of information. While my current role primarily involves Java engineering, my title is a full-stack engineer in the company.

So, how can I prove that I am an information genius? In my daily work, I am learning about cloud computing, and during my leisure time, I study neural networks, as explained in my article "I Finally Understand How Neural Networks Work." When I relax or drive, I enjoy watching Japanese TikTok videos and listening to podcasts, as I described in my article "Why and How I Learn Japanese." Zhiwei is sprinting towards the goal of being recognized as a true information genius.

In the past 10 years, I have experienced numerous failures. However, I now feel that I am starting to taste some success. Recently, there have been moments when I am extremely happy. Sometimes, I can't believe how intellectually sharp I am now, how I can learn anything I set my mind to, and how I can devise solutions to achieve my goals.

After shutting down my startup and spending the first half of the COVID period learning and working as a freelancer to make a living, I joined two startup companies in Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Unfortunately, I was fired from both. When I was let go by the first company after two months, I blamed the boss for being bad. However, when I was fired from the second company within a week, I realized that I had been mistaken, and my previous boss was actually good.

I believe my struggles stemmed from the fact that after running my own startup for three years and working as a freelancer for another 1.5 years, I was not adequately prepared for working in a company. The transition from being a proud startup founder to a subordinate engineer was challenging. I faced numerous obstacles and setbacks. Despite these experiences, I maintain a friendly relationship with my two former bosses who let me go, and we still communicate occasionally.

Working for global companies has been immensely beneficial for me. I have been employed by two global banks thus far. The people I've encountered there have given me confidence and shown great tolerance. Although I am only required to be in the office for a minimum of two days, I rented a parking spot near the office for 1000 CNY and drive there every working day. I enjoy listening to Japanese TikTok during my commute. I hold a small remote control in my left hand while my right hand remains on the steering wheel. I watch short TikTok videos with my eyes on the road and occasionally use my left hand to scroll through videos on my iPhone.

This experience brings me tremendous joy. I find myself laughing out loud multiple times a day. I cherish the interesting words and ideas shared by my colleagues. I contemplate how I can showcase my genius abilities on social media and impress others with my accomplishments. I appreciate the way my colleagues deliver harsh truths with utmost politeness. To be honest, I apologize if I sound too blunt, but phrases like "sorry for being too honest" have become commonplace among my colleagues.

It's fascinating how, as a genius, I can express myself authentically without offending anyone. This is because I have fellow geniuses as colleagues in the company and genius friends on social media.

I believe I am a genius, and I believe everyone else is a genius too. My two-year-old daughter is undoubtedly a genius. I have learned a great deal by observing her and playing with her. Her Chinese language skills surpass my Japanese proficiency. She has taught me many things. She engages in play and displays curiosity in everything she encounters. I truly envy her fearlessness. She fearlessly climbs to touch tourist attractions while leaving the specialized paths designated for adults. She breaks rules and fearlessly engages in activities that adults either lack the courage to do or never even consider after growing up. She happily plays with toys, while we adults often need a purpose behind our actions. For me, that purpose is learning. I must learn something while doing something. It's too purpose-driven.

I am grateful to the company for allowing me to be a child genius again naturally. I am also thankful for Yin Wang, a genius in his own right, who continually learns and shares his knowledge. He is an expert in programming languages, having previously worked as a Staff Software Engineer at Intel and a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft. In recent years, he has delved into learning Japanese, music, painting, and more. He is absolutely correct in asserting that we can learn easily by constantly thinking and questioning.

After two months of dedicating my leisure time to listening to Japanese content, my brain has become accustomed to the language. I now enjoy singing along to the songs playing on my phone during my drives. Soon, I will be comfortable speaking Japanese, even though I lack the patience to sit down and understand the written symbols or their meanings.

I learned this from my daughter. Chinese sounds helped her when she was younger and unable to speak fluently. At two years old, she could express herself simply, saying things like "mama," "papa," "I'm holding the ball," or "I didn't learn English today." Due to her exposure to English animations, she is comfortable with English sounds as well. Naturally, children are adaptable to any language. It is only as they grow older that the second language becomes uncomfortable.

It all comes down to the environment. Many children in Hong Kong are fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English because they are immersed in these languages. When it comes to learning, environment is crucial. Nowadays, the internet provides a convenient means of creating such an environment if one desires it. For instance, I changed my mobile phone's system language to Japanese for a few weeks. Initially, I struggled to use my phone correctly and often made mistakes while operating it. However, after a few days, I realized that learning from a book about neural networks is actually easier than spending an entire day immersed in the Japanese language.

This is my genius way of learning. I listen to audio materials while driving or during my leisure time, regardless of the subject matter. Whether it's Japanese or cutting-edge machine learning papers, this approach works for me. YouTube offers numerous videos explaining machine learning papers. Once I feel comfortable with the material, I am then able to sit down and read papers or books attentively.

Listening before reading allows me to grasp the concepts more easily. I read to supplement my brain's effort to fully comprehend the material.

Over the past six months, I have analyzed hundreds of long log files. I meticulously copy them from the cloud computing platform, separate continuous log lines by adding new lines, and format JSON-formatted logs using a Visual Studio Code plugin to enhance readability. I search for keywords to find the information I need. I scrutinize every line of source code, occasionally wondering why certain logs were not printed. When encountering error stack traces involving underlying framework code I've never worked with before, I delve into it and learn.

I have become unafraid of any code, document, or log. It doesn't matter who wrote it or what code it involves. Due to my experience in Android and iOS development from 2013 to 2015, I find analyzing and reading code in those languages to be effortless. Recently, I directly examined iOS code and discovered that it was not the first API call causing the problem, but rather the second continuous API call. In these moments, I feel like an information genius.

In large company projects, there can be hundreds of microservices on the backend, and the frontend is also a sizable project. Countless documents and tickets exist. I have the ability to navigate between them and extract the information I need. Although I still have much to learn, my years of learning and programming have made me unafraid of the learning process. After all, it's all about learning.

Now, when I receive a ticket, I embark on a journey to learn everything about the code and documentation surrounding it. I am sometimes amazed at how easy it has become for me. After dedicating months to learning about neural networks during my leisure time, I have developed a slight fearlessness when faced with mathematical formulas. In comparison, they are actually easier to tackle than the Japanese language, of which I understand nothing about its written symbols. Nevertheless, I have methods to learn it. So why couldn't I learn math?

During my high school years, I envied those who won gold medals in the National Olympiad in Informatics in China. I always wondered how they achieved such success and how I could do the same. Now, I understand the answer. In high school, I didn't work hard enough and lacked focus. I also lacked the environment to excel. I was the only one practicing and participating in such competitions.

In retrospect, many of my failures could have been avoided. These failures turned the most optimistic person into the most pessimistic. However, they also provided me with the strength to face challenges and difficulties.

The kind-hearted people in my life saved me. Their kindness and tolerance moved me to tears as I reflect on my journey.

We are currently living in a remarkable era. The value of information is surpassing the value of land. People all over the world are contributing to the generation of truly valuable information. I hope this article can also be of help, especially to those who are 10 years old and have a passion for learning. Many individuals are eager to help and share their knowledge. I can't imagine what your generation, including my daughter's generation, will achieve as you all grow up.
