### Time Flies: A Year in Review

![Image](/assets/images/summary/summary0.jpg)

Time flies, and another year has passed. A year ago, I could never have imagined that I would spend my 22nd year like this.

This year, my thoughts have undoubtedly undergone a huge transformation. A year ago, I was running Qu Zhibo alone, scrolling through my contact list to see which tech expert I hadn't yet invited to share their knowledge on the platform. I sent messages, discussed live stream topics, published announcements, promoted everywhere, and then maintained the platform during live broadcasts. By April, Ye Fei, the former Vice President of Jumei, invested in me. Later, in April, Mr. Li Xiaolai invested, and by July and August, I had eight colleagues working with me on Qu Zhibo. With the increase in operating costs, it became unsustainable, and only four colleagues and I remained, feeling directionless. In September, I faced a personal crisis, impulsively went to the U.S. to win back my ex-girlfriend, and spent four weeks there. By late October, I returned to China to work part-time at Ye Fei's company and took on some outsourcing projects. By January, I stopped the part-time work and returned to entrepreneurship full-time, working on outsourcing projects, stationed at partner companies from Monday to Friday, sometimes running to the tax bureau to issue invoices, and communicating with clients about projects.

The fluctuations in my finances over the year are also telling. From struggling at the beginning of the year with only a few thousand yuan, to having 550,000 yuan in the bank after financing, then spending too quickly on recruitment and being directionless, leaving only 100,000 yuan. By October, I took on multiple jobs, working day and night writing code, gradually earning some money back, with 230,000 yuan in outsourcing income.

In October, I wrote an article summarizing the gains and losses of Qu Zhibo:

***

In summary, a 1995-born entrepreneur created a knowledge live streaming platform, writing code and promoting it alone, gaining over 20,000 users and 120,000 yuan in revenue. Ye Fei, the former Vice President of Jumei, supported with 50,000 yuan, and later, Mr. Li Xiaolai invested 500,000 yuan. The founder then recruited eight employees, with salaries ranging from 5,000 to 15,000 yuan. Moving from a home office to a larger office, the founder lost focus, failed to manage properly, and did not set a clear strategy, leading to a loss and only 100,000 yuan remaining. Employees left, leaving only the founder alone again.

This story is very similar to other startup failure stories. Previously, I read about the story of Wang Kaixin, the miraculous girl born in 1998, and I thought I wouldn't end up like that; I believed I was more reliable. I've seen many stories of entrepreneurs who, after raising a lot of money, became arrogant, moved to bigger offices, hired more employees, and then quickly went bankrupt. I thought I wouldn't make such stupid mistakes, but it turns out I did. It wasn't until I experienced it that I realized I was also foolish.

On March 23, I published a report about Qu Zhibo's financing, titled "22-year-old boy establishes Qu Zhibo in half a year and receives investment from former Vice President of Jumei Ye Fei." Many friends helped to share it, resulting in 15,000 views. Following that, Pencil and Lieyun interviewed me, and both published reports. I also shared the article in many groups, receiving praise and likes, especially from some founder groups where prominent figures praised and shared it, making me very happy.

At that time, two partners joined Qu Zhibo: one was a senior user of Qu Zhibo who participated in the most live streams, and the other was an alumnus from Beilin. I also spent some time moving my home to Wangjing, living in an office at Wangjing SOHO. Thanks to investor Ye Fei, who allowed us to use a friend's office for free.

I felt that attracting users through live streaming was slow, so I tried community viral marketing. I invited a few tech experts to be present in a group, created a poster, and asked everyone to share it to join the group. We created several 500-member groups this way, resulting in thousands of shares. However, there were some issues: I wrote a bot program to automatically add people to the group, but WeChat restrictions on fast operations led to complaints from some users who shared the poster but weren't added to the group.

In April, a friend introduced me to Mr. Li Xiaolai. A week later, 500,000 yuan was transferred. We handled the equity transfer along with Ye Fei's previous investment. Mr. Li Xiaolai, who knew Ye Fei, was introduced by a CTO friend who noticed Qu Zhibo in the tech circle. After observing me through my WeChat moments, he thought I seemed reliable and innovative. Thanks to Ye Fei's endorsement and the introduction, the investment deal was quickly finalized after a one-hour chat. I asked Mr. Li why he invested in me, and he said he saw potential in a young man developing a product from scratch alone and wanted to help me improve.

With 500,000 yuan in the account, I felt a significant change. I had never handled so much money before. Previously, after working for a year and a half, I saved 120,000 yuan, gave 50,000 yuan to my parents, and had 70,000 yuan left in Alipay. The first half-year of my first venture, I spent all my savings. In the first half-year of Qu Zhibo, my parents supported me with 7,000 yuan monthly, covering rent, server fees, company registration, and living expenses.

From April to June, we continued with live streams like "2 Hours on the Internet's 20-Year History" by Gao Chunhui, "BestSwifter's Advanced iOS Course," "Baidu Maps Public Class," "Future of iOS Development from WWDC2017," "Introduction to Computer Vision," and "Go Programming in One Hour." Yanbo helped with stream maintenance and operations. Besides live streaming, I spent time interviewing and recruiting new team members, reaching out to high school friends and college roommates for candidates. Although we hired a few people, I felt lonely in the office and recruited more.

In July, with five new members joining, we had a total of six people, including me. We had a dinner together. There were three more pending hires. Salaries were market-based: 5,500 yuan per month for fresh graduates, and 10,000 to 15,000 yuan for those with 2-3 years of experience.

Although I wanted to pivot in July, I didn't make a firm decision, so we continued with live streams like "Consistency in High Concurrency Systems." We invited foreign tech expert Sam for "Ray Wenderlich CTO Shares iOS Concurrency Programming," with over 1,600 attendees. We also held live streams on career planning, web security, and password recovery. In July, I asked new colleagues to convert previous live streams into WeChat articles.

Since online streams weren't profitable, we tried offline events. On July 26, we contacted speakers, designed posters, and arranged venues. The event page was published on July 31, and we encouraged colleagues to call users to register. Over 100 people signed up for the 288-yuan event, held on August 6. This event mobilized the team, with everyone playing their roles. Organizing a larger event forced me to rely on others, which improved my management skills.

After the August 6 event, we summarized the activities and prepared transcripts of guest speeches. In August, we paid salaries of over 70,000 yuan and rent of 13,000 yuan. We moved our office from Wangjing SOHO to Hesheng Qilin Community. After paying the salaries, we had about 200,000 yuan left in the company account. I felt a strong sense of crisis and sought help from friends.

I informed colleagues about the company's situation and decided to cut salaries by one-third. I spoke with each person, explaining the lack of a clear strategic direction and financial pressure, leading some team members to leave. The remaining three in operations stayed, with reduced salaries.

I also decided to repay the 66,000 yuan my parents had given me over the first half-year of Qu Zhibo. I wanted to be self-reliant and not burden them further. This way, if the company went bankrupt, my parents might still support me with a few thousand yuan monthly to start over. If I continued to drain their resources, they wouldn't be able to support me indefinitely.

In September, I considered several directions, like creating a high-end paid tech community or a tech media platform. On September 16, I made a rash decision to go to the U.S.

From September 20 to October 14, I spent over 20 days traveling in the U.S., visiting New York, Niagara Falls, Washington, Seattle, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Francisco. I visited friends, saw the world, and thought about my future direction, spending 40,000 yuan.

So, this unreliable 95-born CEO spent 550,000 yuan of investment, leaving only 100,000 yuan.

Here is the company's monthly expenditure for the year:

| Month | Expenditure (10,000 yuan) |
| --- |:--:|
| 16.08 | 2.6 |
| 16.09 | 0.9 |
| 16.10 | 1.0 |
| 16.11 | 0.9 |
| 16.12 | 0.8 |
| 17.01 | 0.8 |
| 17.02 | 0.5 |
| 17.03 | 1.6 |
| 17.04 | 2.0 |
| 17.05 | 3.0 |
| 17.06 | 6.3 |
| 17.07 | 16.1 |
| 17.08 | 14.8 |
| 17.09 | 5.5 |
| 17.10 | 3.3 |

Running a company requires money everywhere. Unknowingly, we spent a lot. In July and August, when we had nine people, we provided meals. Each meal cost 25 yuan, amounting to 9,000 yuan per month. Monthly meal costs were nearly 10,000 yuan, which was very high. You can see that as the company grew, so did salaries, with poorly controlled costs leading to high expenses in July and August.

The story ends here. First, I feel sorry for my investors. I feel guilty towards myself too. Initially, I was focused, working from home, writing code, and finding hosts. Later, with some money, I started thinking about management, recruiting, and pivoting, trying various things without focus.

I thank the investors for their initial support, providing real money to back me. I'm sorry to have disappointed you. I didn't use the money well, didn't grasp the pace, and made numerous mistakes, failing to use the money wisely.

Second, to the colleagues who joined me, I apologize. Due to my unclear strategy, poor management, and inadequate task assignments, coupled with poor cash flow control, I persuaded you to join the company only to let you go shortly after. However, working with you made us better acquainted, and we remain good friends, with potential future cooperation opportunities.

I also feel sorry for myself. From November 2015, after two entrepreneurial ventures, neither resulted in success. I spent all the 60,000 yuan saved previously, didn't earn much over the past two years, lost a few thousand yuan of my parents' money, and lost 450,000 yuan of investors' money. If I had worked steadily, I might have saved 300,000 yuan by now, enough for a house down payment in my hometown.

But honestly, I have no regrets. I am grateful for my efforts in the first half-year of Qu Zhibo and have learned lessons from the second half-year. In the long run, these experiences are valuable, but I can't afford to make the same mistakes twice.

***

The above is a reflection article written around November but never published.

After returning from the U.S. in late October, investor Ye Fei wanted me to help rewrite a system. Having experienced so much, I couldn't afford to be directionless anymore. I needed to focus and get back to a productive state. I accepted his offer and joined his company part-time.

After joining, I quickly took over the project, leveraging my experience from previous ventures where I had to handle various tasks alone, coding both frontend and backend, using Node, PHP, and writing in multiple languages in a single day. Within a week, I asked Ye Fei about my performance. He said I was much more mature and resilient than a year ago.

My basic belief is that a company owner bears the greatest operational risk, paying salaries every month. If the company fails, it's their loss. Trusting you with responsibilities and paying above market rates is already rare. Having run a company and lost 550,000 yuan, I understand this. I am grateful for anyone who provides me with money, and I strive to work hard and live up to their expectations.

In early November, a friend approached me with a project idea, seeking developers. On one hand, I wondered if I could take on more work to push myself harder. On the other hand, I needed more income to repay the money lost with Qu Zhibo. Additionally, I had promised Ye Fei to work part-time on rewriting a system for a few months.

So, I accepted the challenge and took on the project with a close friend.

My typical work routine involved waking up at 9:30 AM, arriving at the company by 10:30 AM, quickly solving lunch with takeout, working until 10 PM, then heading to my friend's place to continue working on the other project until 5 AM. This continued for over a month, with no weekends. Saturdays were spent coding at my friend's place, and Sundays involved meetings at the partner company.

Later, my efficiency at the part-time job dropped, and the leader pointed it out. Although I couldn't tell my leader about my side job, I reminded myself to stay efficient at work. Despite feeling exhausted, I stayed focused and completed tasks.

That period was exhausting, waking up at 9:30 AM regardless of when I slept. At work, I had to stay alert. My leader's criticism felt unfair, as I was working hard, but they didn't know about my side job. However, this was my choice, and I had to accept it.

Eventually, I adapted to sleeping only four hours a night, finding that less sleep made me more energetic!

Sleep is a basic human need. If you can overcome sleep, many challenges become surmountable. Being this harsh on myself provided the drive to make many changes.

That period was fulfilling. Napping in a DiDi express ride from Wangjing to my friend's place in Wudaokou was a luxury. The pain of exhaustion was better than the pain of aimlessness.

By December 17, the outsourcing project was completed, and the company's project was also wrapped up. The rewritten system was ready for database migration. Previously, the table structure and system were messy, with multiple subprojects in Node and PHP. Now, they were unified under a Laravel framework. The migration started at noon on December 21, facing unexpected bugs, leading to two days and nights of continuous work. Surprisingly, I managed to work for such an extended period, breaking a personal record:

By January 5, a friend approached me with another project. Having fulfilled my commitment to Ye Fei by successfully rewriting and migrating the system, I decided to focus on entrepreneurship full-time, taking on outsourcing projects. We took on two or three projects, including an online claw machine. Having gone through the previous hellish challenge, things became easier, allowing for normal sleep patterns. I worked on-site at partner companies from Monday to Friday, handling negotiations and tax bureau visits.

Visiting the tax bureau to issue invoices took a while. Our quarterly tax reports for the third and fourth quarters were not submitted, resulting in a 200 yuan fine, preventing us from issuing VAT invoices. From January 15 to 19, I visited the tax bureau daily to resolve this. Initially, our accounting was outsourced, but I decided to learn it myself this year. Knowing nothing about accounting, I sought help from various people. I went from the first to the second floor, and from one office to another, eventually finding Director Fan to resolve the fine. The tax bureau closes at 5:30 PM, so I had to return the next day. On the third day, I cleared the fine, enabling the system to process it. On the fourth day, I discovered that VAT invoices required a tripartite agreement with the bank for direct debit. I went to China Merchants Bank in Wudaokou, signed the agreement, and returned to the tax bureau on the fifth day, finally issuing the VAT invoice.

Having completed these tasks, I was able to earn money. From October to now, the company earned 230,000 yuan from various outsourcing projects. Hard work pays off, and I hope to continue working hard.

These experiences have given me new insights:

Running a company requires focus. Focus is extremely important. You can pivot, but you must do so decisively. Don't keep pondering and hesitating; take action and be decisive. If you want to do self-media, then do it. If you want to do offline events, then do it. Define the company's long-term strategy and execute it swiftly. Don't keep trying different things without commitment. Thinking too much and doing too little is a big no-no.

Learn to say no. Life is full of distractions. Learn to say no and focus on your important goals. If you don't accomplish your important tasks, everything else is futile. Everyone knows this, but we often aren't strict with ourselves, not dedicating all our time to important tasks and people. I now earn money because I spend all my time on earning it, working with those who help me earn. Colleagues and partners. No time for nonsense.

If you're not earning money, you're spending it. Life requires money everywhere. If you want to save money, you must earn it. When you're busy earning, you have no time to spend. Spending money is unavoidable, but it should be for essential expenses like rent and transportation. The best way to save money is to spend all your time earning it.

I've been reflecting on why I now earn more in a few months than I did in a year of entrepreneurship. It might sound laughable, but Qu Zhibo's annual revenue was 150,000 yuan, with an income of about 50,000 yuan. The first half-year had 120,000 yuan in revenue, while the second half was a disaster. These are two business models. One is B2C, targeting ordinary users with low unit prices, not generating much revenue from 27,000 developer users due to limited technical and promotional resources. The other is B2B, with high unit prices, targeting business owners.

However, no path is wasted. My ability to take on these outsourcing projects now is due

 to the reputation I built with Qu Zhibo, earning the trust of friends who saw my efforts and achievements. Later, when I switched business models, I could support myself and stop losing money.

Be more self-centered; successful people are more self-centered. Worshipping others, taking photos with them, or basking in their glory won't earn genuine respect. You gain fame by excelling in difficult tasks. Pride comes from creating something, not enjoying something, attending concerts, meeting people, reading books, or receiving praise. These trivialities are not memorable. Life is short; focus on important things and dedicate yourself to them.

While gazing at the stars, keep your feet on the ground. Discussing how to become a billionaire is pointless; first, aim for a monthly income of 100,000 yuan. Talking about industry trends is futile; first, create an excellent product. Always be aware of your current achievements and set realistic goals. Discussing distant aspirations is meaningless. If you want to be a billionaire, solve the current technical challenge first. If you want to run a billion-yuan outsourcing company, start by visiting many business owner clients.

We all want to win but can't rush it. It takes steps, one at a time. Failing to control risks and taking too big steps will lead to failure. Qu Zhibo's situation was such that we couldn't afford to pay so many salaries monthly. The company wasn't profitable, and with my background, securing significant financing for a money-burning business was difficult.

Control risks and take it step by step. Life is long. I'm impatient, but reality teaches patience.

I now have a new understanding of leadership. I always thought of myself as a loner, lacking leadership. Now, I see I have some leadership qualities. Leadership isn't just about high emotional intelligence or motivating others; it's about doing the dirtiest jobs, bearing the most pressure, and doing what others won't. Organizing a team, finding money, people, and projects is challenging. If you're willing to do it, you'll naturally become the team's core and a dependable person.

By organizing activities, becoming the leader of many groups, discussing projects, and organizing outsourcing teams, I've gained confidence in my leadership. Fearlessness in the face of failure, people's refusal to join activities or live streams, and criticism makes me hopeful that my thick skin can be as tough as micro-businesses, caring only about selling.

Jack Ma, Pony Ma, Cheng Wei—why do they compete in every field? Because successful people are self-centered; they don't give an inch to their competitors. Only by being stronger than your competitors can you claim to contribute to the world and donate wealth.

My goal for 2018 is simple: to steadily build a reputable outsourcing company, aiming for five full-time employees and 1.5 million yuan in annual revenue by the end of the year.

Please recommend projects to me—front-end, back-end, mini-programs, and apps. We're also gradually moving into AI, so any AI projects are welcome. Industry referrals have a 20% commission. Everyone benefits, ensuring long-term cooperation.

Our tech stack includes PHP, Java, Go, JavaScript, Vue, Objective-C, iOS, Android, Kafka, streaming media, etc.

***

2017 was eventful, like a rollercoaster. Sometimes I felt invincible, aiming to serve a billion users; other times, I felt useless, just a talker. Now, I'm calmer about life's ups and downs. Like the stock market, to win big, you must risk losing big. You can win as much as you can lose. Winning now means nothing; you must keep winning.

Life is like this: ups and downs. Your perceived peak might be the start of a downfall, and your lowest point might mark a new victory.

In 2018, I'll strive to earn back all the lost money and steadily build the company.

I have many people to thank this year. First, thank you to Mr. Li Xiaolai, Ye Fei, and my parents for supporting my entrepreneurship financially. Mr. Li and Ye Fei are incredibly nice people. Despite losing money, Mr. Li didn't blame me and told me it was okay. He said he'd help without causing trouble, giving me maximum freedom and always being there for me.

A conversation with Mr. Li made me realize that growth often relies on oneself. He shared his experiences in the "Get" column, and those willing to learn can benefit from them. I shouldn't take too much of Mr. Li's time. I'm grateful that Mr. Li always responded to me, showing he hadn't given up on me. Now that I’m earning some money, I hope to improve and live up to Mr. Li’s expectations.

Thanks to Ye Fei. After my month-long trip to the U.S., he criticized my irresponsibility and the failure to build the company. He warned me about over-hiring earlier, which I sometimes ignored.

Thanks to my close friend who worked with me. During those days, you wouldn't let me sleep at 3 AM, pushing me to finish work and not let you down. Thank you for your strictness.

Thanks to the colleagues at Qu Zhibo. In the short two months, we accomplished some tasks and organized an event.

Thanks to the hosts at Qu Zhibo who shared their knowledge and skills, helping us gain 27,000 engineer users. Thanks to you, I met many developer friends, gradually increasing Qu Zhibo’s recognition in the tech circle.

Thanks to the users of Qu Zhibo. Despite having no money or resources, we gained users through your shares. Thanks for participating in Qu Zhibo's activities.

Thanks to clients and partners for your trust and collaboration in developing products.

Thanks to friends in the U.S. who hosted me: Gu Yindaozhang, Peng Qige, Gao Xiejie, Kongming Liuzhuan, Wu Yuxin, and friends from Silicon Valley Scouts.

Thanks to everyone who followed and supported Qu Zhibo in 2017. Your likes during tough times kept me going. I remember the many friends who checked on me after I published my article about going to the U.S. to find my ex-girlfriend. Thank you all.

That's my story. Wishing everyone a happy Chinese New Year in advance!
