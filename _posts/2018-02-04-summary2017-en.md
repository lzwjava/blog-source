 I started a business and lost 45k, earned back 23k, reflecting on my 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time flies, another year has passed. A year ago, I would never have imagined that my 22-year-old self would spend the year like this.

My thoughts underwent a significant change this year. A year ago, I was operating Qu直播 by myself, checking my contact list to see which tech guru hadn't been invited to share on our platform yet, messaging them to discuss the topic of the live session, publishing, and promoting it. I would then maintain the platform during the live event. This continued until April, when Vice President of AggregateApp Jay Fei invested in me. Later in April, Li Xiaocai teacher invested. By July and August, we had eight employees, and we worked together on Qu直播. Operating costs increased, making it difficult to sustain, leaving us with four employees and me. By September, I faced a personal crisis and went to the US to win back my ex-girlfriend. I stayed there for four weeks. By the end of October, I returned to Jay Fei's company to work part-time and do some outsourcing projects. I stopped part-time work in January and focused on full-time outsourcing projects, going to cooperating companies from Monday to Friday to develop on-site, sometimes running errands to the tax bureau to get invoices, and communicating with clients about projects and so on. I started the year with barely enough money, having only a few thousand RMB on me. After securing funding of 55万 RMB, I hired too many people and overspent in various directions, leaving me with only 10万 RMB. By October, I began working on multiple projects and wrote code all night and day. Gradually, I earned back some money with outsourcing income of 23万 RMB.

In October, I wrote an article summarizing the gains and losses of Quzhibo:

---

In summary, a 95-year-old entrepreneur created a knowledge live platform, writing code and promoting it himself, amassing over 20,000 users and 12,000 in revenue. The vice president of Jumuetech, Lei Fei, provided 5,000 RMB in support, followed by 50,000 RMB investment from Li Xiaoming teacher. The founder then hired eight employees, with salaries ranging from 5,000 to 15,000 RMB, moving from a small apartment to a larger office, and losing focus, unable to manage, and lacking a clear strategy and work arrangement for employees. Consequently, he lost money, leaving only 10,000 RMB, and the employees resigned, leaving the founder alone.

This story is similar to the common startup failure stories I've seen. I used to think I wouldn't be like that, that I would be more sensible. After seeing numerous startup founders who raised a lot of money and then became arrogant, moving to larger offices, and hiring more employees, only to quickly go bankrupt, I thought I wouldn't make such a foolish mistake. However, only through experience did I realize, I too, am that foolish.: In March 23rd, Quzhaolive's financing report was released, "22-year-old founder created Quzhaolive half a year ago, received investment from former Jumei deputy general manager Lei Fei." Many friends helped share it, with over 15,000 views. After that, Kaibi Tang and Lieyun Wang interviewed me, and both sides published articles. I also sent this article to many groups, and everyone praised it, especially some founder groups, where they saw impressive people and gave me likes and shares.

At that time, two partners joined Quzhaolive. One was a senior user of Quzhaolive, who had attended the most live sessions, and another was a schoolmate of mine, Wang Xiaoshou. I also moved my family to Wake Up and rented an office in Wake Up SOHO. At that time, I borrowed a friend's office from Lei Fei boss's relationship, so the office was free.

At that time, I felt that the live broadcast was attracting users a bit slowly, so I did some social media splits to attract users. I invited a few technical big-name friends to sit in a group, and then made a poster, which could be shared to join the group. At that time, I made a few groups of 5000 people, so the number of poster shares was over a thousand. However, there were some problems. I wrote a robot program to automatically pull people into the group, but fast operations would be restricted by WeChat. Some partners shared the poster but were not pulled into the group, and they were angry. In addition, compared to PPT study groups and English study groups, which occasionally appeared in friends' circles, many users were tricked into joining the group, only to find that there was no useful information in the group, and they no longer trusted such groups.

In April, a friend introduced me to Li Xiaolai teacher, and a week later, 500,000 yuan was transferred to my account. Then I went to do equity transfer, and also transferred the equity of the previous Lei Fei boss's investment. Li Xiaolai teacher, because he knew Lei Fei boss. The friend who introduced me was a CTO. Because we had some influence in the technical circle, he saw Quzhaolive through his friend's circle and added me on WeChat, and we chatted for a while. He had been observing me from his friend's circle for a long time, and I seemed reliable, and young with ideas. With Lei Fei boss's support and this friend's introduction, this financing talk was very quick, and we chatted for about an hour. I asked Li Xiaolai teacher why he invested in me. He said, "First, I saw a young man who made a product from scratch alone, which was not bad. Second, what I did was not good enough, and the number of active users was too small, and I wanted to help make it better."

Then the company's account had over 50 million yuan. I had never held so much money before. Before that, I had worked for a year and a half, saved 120,000 yuan, gave my parents 50,000 yuan, and had 70,000 yuan in my Alipay account. In the first half of the first time I started a business, I spent 70,000 yuan. In the first half of Quzhaolive, my parents gave me 7,000 yuan every month for rent, server fees, company registration, and living expenses.: By June 4th and 6th, I continued doing live shows. High Springfu teacher's "Two Hours to Cover the Internet over the Past 20 Years," "Advanced iOS Course by bestswifter," "Baidu Map Open Class," "Looking into the Future of iOS Development from WWDC2017," "Computer Vision from Beginner to Wild," and "Technical Manager of Small Envy Brings You an Hour into Go" were among them. At that time, Jingwaves helped the host with debugging and operations. Besides these live shows, I spent some time interviewing and hiring partners. I called my high school classmates, went back to college dorms to chat with friends, and recruited from among acquaintances. I first recruited a few people, but they all joined in July and I felt lonely and empty at the company, so I recruited a few more.

At that time, I thought that my lack of progress in April and May was due to the fact that the interest in live shows only had a few people involved. I should build a team to handle more things. The team was too small, and I couldn't manage it, so I should recruit more people, force myself to learn to manage a team, and delegate my work to them. Although the cost would be much higher with more salaries, it was worth it if I could learn to manage a team, recruit, and cooperate effectively. The company couldn't develop slowly, it needed to grow quickly.

By July 4th, there were already 5 partners on board, making a total of 6, including myself. We had a gathering. There were still 3 people to be recruited. We were mostly talking market wages: 5500 yuan a month for fresh graduates, and 10,000-15,000 yuan for those with 2-3 years of experience.

In July, although I had been thinking about a career change, I hadn't made up my mind and continued doing live shows. There was a live show on "Consistency in Large-Scale High Concurrency Systems." I invited a foreign tech expert, Sam, to speak. There were over 1600 people in attendance for this show. There was also an "IT Career Planning Tea Party," and a "Web Security: A Chat on User Password Reset." My new hires were then tasked with turning these past live shows into public articles and distributing them.

Since I wasn't making money online, I decided to try offline events. On July 26th, I began contacting guests, and my team handled posters and venue arrangements. On July 31st, posters and event pages were published, and my team made calls to users to encourage registration. The 288 yuan event attracted over 100 registrations. It was held on August 6th. This event was quite successful, and the team was fully mobilized. Everyone had their roles, as there were many tasks that needed to be done for the offline event, and I couldn't do it all myself, so I had to rely on everyone to work together. This required managing abilities, so to hone my management skills, I had to take on a larger project and depend on many people. I found myself managing guests, editing event pages, hosting, contacting venues, providing self-service catering, live broadcasting, and welcoming guests, among other things. The event was quite good, and we made 20,700 yuan, but the cost was 32,000 yuan, and we lost 5,000 yuan. Oh well, it was a good learning experience to organize an event. after the event on August 6th ended, we started sorting out the summary and recordings of the speeches. In August, salaries were distributed, amounting to over 70,000, with rent of around 13,000. Our office moved from Wanji SOHO to the adjacent Chongwenmen Qilin She, and we began paying office rent. After distributing salaries, the company account still had about 20 million. At this rate, we would be bankrupt in two months. I suddenly felt a strong sense of crisis and sought help from friends.

I informed my colleagues about the company's situation and made a decision to reduce salaries by one-third. I spoke to each person. I explained that the company currently lacked a clear strategic direction and was facing economic pressure, requiring some team members to leave. Thus, one designer and four people from the technical department left the company. The remaining three people from the operational departments received significant pay cuts and stayed.

I then made a decision. In the first half of the year, my parents had supported me with 66,000 RMB on Quan Zhilive. I felt that I should repay them. My entrepreneurship was my own affair, and I shouldn't burden my parents. I returned the money to my parents. If I continued to lose money, they might not be able to support me indefinitely.

Then came September. I considered various directions, such as creating a high-end paid tech community or a tech media. On September 16th, something happened, and I went to the United States.

From September 20th to October 14th, I spent over 20 days in the United States, visiting friends in New York, Niagara Falls, Washington D.C., Seattle, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Francisco. I traveled to see the world, clear my mind, and think about future development directions, spending around 40,000 RMB.: Therefore, this unpredictable CEO of mine from 1995, spent all 550,000 RMB of our investments, leaving only 100,000 RMB.

Monthly expenses for this startup so far:

| Time  | Expenses (ten thousands) |
|-------|------------------------|
|16.08  | 2.6                    | 16.09 0.9

II. August: 17.08 | 1,476.80
III. September: 17.09 | 277.50
IV. October: 17.10 | 110.65

At our company, money is needed everywhere. Before we knew it, we had spent quite a lot. In July and August, when there were nine of us in the company, we used to take turns to buy meals, with each person paying 25 yuan for a meal, resulting in a monthly cost of 9,000 yuan for the company canteen. The canteen cost was approaching 10,000 yuan per month, which was quite a high cost. As a result, you can see that with the increase in company size, wages have had to be raised, and costs have not been well controlled. The expenses in July and August were significantly higher.

I have finished telling the story. Firstly, I feel remorseful towards my investors. I also feel remorseful towards myself. I used to live frugally at home, focusing on my work and writing code, looking for hosts to promote. After getting some money, I started thinking about managing, recruiting people, and transforming the business, trying various things, and no longer focusing on my work.

Thank you to my investors for supporting me initially with real gold and silver. I'm sorry for disappointing you. I didn't use the money effectively, didn't manage the rhythm well, didn't value the money that came easily, and didn't use the money wisely, instead making many mistakes. I'm sorry to my colleagues who joined the company with me, due to my unclear strategy, inability to manage, unclear task assignments, and poor cash flow control, which led to your departure from the company shortly after recruiting you. Fortunately, our brief work experience brought us closer, and we are still good friends, and there might be opportunities for cooperation in the future.

I feel really sorry for myself. Since November 2015, I have been experimenting with businesses twice, but the results were not good. I spent the 60,000 RMB I saved before, made no money in the past two years, and even owed my parents several tens of thousands of RMB and 45,000 RMB to investors. If I had worked diligently, I might have saved 300,000 RMB by now, enough to pay the down payment for a house in my hometown.

However, I have no regrets. I am grateful for my hard work in the first half of Liveme, and I learned some lessons from the second half. In the long run, these experiences were worth it, but mistakes cannot be made twice. I joined the company in October and started quickly taking over projects, using the determination I needed to start a business alone. I switched between front-end, back-end, Node, and PHP, writing several types of languages in a day. I smoothly took over the technical responsibilities. A year ago, I had worked at this company for a month before leaving to start my own business. At the time, the CTO's evaluation of me was low, and I had never seen such a low evaluation. I reflected on it, so this time I just focused on doing the work, not going to the boss to report what I had done, cooperating with my team, listening more to my colleagues, and not rushing to express my opinions. Everything was for getting the job done, not to show off. A week later, I asked Lei Fei boss how I had performed. He said I had matured more and was more enduring.

My basic thought is that the company and the boss bear the greatest operational risk. He sends salaries to everyone every month, and if the company doesn't succeed, it is his loss. He trusts you and gives you a higher salary than the market price. Because I have run a company and once lost an investment of 550,000 and was left with only 10,000, I know this. The boss bears the greatest risk. I am grateful to anyone who gives me money, and I will work hard and not disappoint their expectations.

In early November, a friend approached me, saying they had an idea and wanted to find someone to develop it. On the one hand, I wanted to do an additional job to push myself harder and make myself more tired. On the other hand, I had lost a lot of money on live broadcasting and had not earned it back yet, so I felt uncomfortable facing my investors. Moreover, I had agreed to help Lei Fei boss write a system as a part-time job, so I could only work for a few months.

So I accepted this challenge and worked on this project with one of my friends. I usually work at this rhythm: get up at 9:30 am, reach the company by 10:30 am, have lunchtime delivery to solve quickly, work until 10 pm, go to my friend's house to continue working for another company on projects. This lasts until around 5 am in the morning. I have been doing this for over a month without weekends. On Saturdays, I write code at my friend's house all day, and on Sundays, I go to the cooperative company for meetings.

Later, my productivity at the bakery decreased, and my leader pointed this out. I indeed had lower productivity because I was working for another company at night. But I couldn't tell my leader that. I silently told myself to keep working efficiently even when tired. When I was feeling sleepy, I had to remind myself to stay focused and finish the tasks.

During that period, I was very tired, no matter if it was 5 am or 6 am, I still had to get up at 9:30 am. Then, at the company, I had to tell myself to get motivated. My leader told me my productivity was low, and I felt sad inside, I had been working hard. But my leader didn't know that. Who made me work for another company at night? My leader couldn't understand me. I was already exhausted, but I hadn't received recognition, and I was criticized.

This was all my own doing. Yes, I had to accept this discomfort. Since I had promised two jobs, I had to complete both, with no reason or escape route.

The first few days were painful, spending the afternoon lying down, working from 10:30 am to 9:30 pm in a very tired state, continuing to work on modifying bugs and writing code. Then, after 10 pm, I went to my friend's house to accept challenges, learn previously unfamiliar high concurrency technology, set up message queues, and had no experience with Java backend or Spring Batis. Sometimes, I also argued with my friend about technical solutions, which ended up in heated discussions. I will get used to it within a week. I have even found that the less I sleep, the better my spirit is!

Sleep is a basic human need. If one can overcome sleep, many difficulties can be overcome. We can be harsh with ourselves and have the motivation to make many changes.

So that period was fulfilling. Taking a Didi taxi from Wangjing Company to my friend's home at Five-roads, taking a power nap was blissful. This kind of tiredness and pain is better than the aimless and confused pain of having nothing to do.

Later, the project was handed over on December 17th. The projects in the company also came to an end, the new system was completed, and the preparation for the database migration began. Previously, the table structure and system were quite chaotic, with several Node and PHP sub-projects. Now, all will use the new project written with the Laravel framework. The migration started on December 21st at midnight, and there were still some issues by 8 am. I went to the company and continued to fix them. The new project was online, with unexpected Bugs and various modifications. I worked straight through until late at night on the 22nd. I was surprised that I could work for such a long time, breaking my personal record:

![summary3.jpg](summary3.jpg) I started a project for a friend by the 1st of January. After fulfilling my promise to the boss Lei Fei, I smoothly rewrote the system and successfully migrated the database online. I then proposed to no longer work part-time and began my own business, taking on full-time outsourced projects. I accepted a few projects, including an online doll machine. After experiencing the previous hellish challenges, I now find it easier and have returned to normal sleeping patterns. I go to the cooperative company on Mondays to Fridays for development. Sometimes I negotiate partnerships, and other times I run errands to the tax bureau for invoices.

Running errands for invoices took a long time. Since the company had not reported during the third and fourth quarters, they were fined 200 yuan. I could not get invoices issued for the penalty. From the 15th to the 19th of January, I went to the tax bureau every day, from the first floor to the second floor, to the first room, and then to another room, to ask the tax office director to waive the penalty. The tax office closed at 5:30 pm. I stood in line and asked a few questions, and had to wait until the next day. The next day, I continued with reporting and paying value-added tax and personal income tax. I went back to ask the director to waive the penalty and wait for the system to remove the penalty record. The third day, I found out that I needed to sign a three-party agreement with the bank for the corporate account to deduct value-added tax for the invoices. I went to the Wuzhong Branch of China Merchants Bank and signed the agreement, but it was already 5:30 pm. The fourth day, I went to the Haidian Fifth Tax Office and found that the invoice issuing machine had been moved to the 14th office. I applied online, filled out the forms, and printed the invoices, finally obtaining them.

The situation is settled, and I can earn money. From October to the present, the company and multiple outsourced projects have earned a combined income of 230,000 yuan. Every minute of hard work brings a reward, and I hope to continue and work diligently. These experiences gave me a new perspective:

Focusing on a company is crucial. Transformation is possible, but it requires firm determination. Don't keep hesitating and instead take action. If you're doing media, do it; if you're doing offline activities, do that. Clarify your long-term strategic direction and execute it decisively. Don't keep thinking and trying this and that, three days working online and two days fishing. Thinking too much and doing too little is a major pitfall.

Learn to reject. There are too many people and things in life that can distract your attention. Learn to reject, clarify what your important targets and things are, and if important things aren't done, then all other things are in vain. Everyone knows this, but sometimes we're not strict enough and don't put all our time into important things and people.

If you're not earning money, then you're spending it. Life requires spending money everywhere. If you want to save money, then you have to earn it. When earning money is very busy, you don't have time to spend it. All spending is necessary spending, for things like rent and transportation. The best way to save money is to use all your time to earn it.

In fact, I have been reflecting on why I've earned more in the past few months than I did in a year of starting a business. I won't be embarrassed to admit it, my live streaming revenue was around 150,000 RMB with an income of about 50,000 RMB. The first half of the year had revenue of around 120,000 RMB, but the second half was all-out effort. This is actually two business models. One is 2C, facing developers and ordinary users, but despite having around 27,000 user developers, I couldn't make any money from them due to low client prices. The other is 2B, high client prices, one deal worth several tens of thousands, facing enterprise owners. but in reality, there's no such thing as a wasted life in life. Later, I was able to do freelance projects because I built up some reputation during my live streaming, friends thought highly of me, grew to over 20,000 developer users, and even received funding. Therefore, after I started doing freelance work, projects came to me. Moreover, my experience with live streaming helped me endure pressure, understand life's hardships, and learn a little patience. Therefore, after I changed my business model and direction, I was able to sustain myself, no longer losing money, and earning some income.

To live a self-centered life, the more successful a person is, the more self-centered they become. Worshipping any person or taking photos with them, or basking in someone else's glory, will not make people respect you from the heart. You earn respect because you handle difficult things well. What's worth being proud of is what you have created yourself, not what you have enjoyed, attended concerts, met people, read books, or received praise from others. These trivial things are not worth remembering. Life is short, what can we write on our tombstones that matters? Those are the important things, focus on them.

At the same time, I found that gazing at the stars requires grounding your feet on the ground. Discussing how to become a billionaire is meaningless. First, make sure your monthly income is over 10 million. Discussing industry trends is meaningless. First, create an excellent product. Be clear about where you are currently and what achievements you have made. The next step's goal must be realistic. Discussing distant things is meaningless. If you want to become a billionaire, first solve the technical problem in your hand. If you want to build a billion-dollar outsourcing company, first ask how many enterprise owners and customers you have visited.

We all want to win, but we can't rush to succeed. Take it step by step. Neglecting risk control and taking big steps will surely lead to failure. At the time of live streaming, I didn't have the ability to pay so much salary per month. The company was not profitable, and with my background, it was difficult to get a lot of funding for capital-intensive businesses.

Control risks and take it step by step. Life is long. I am a person without patience, and reality tells me that I need patience. I have a new perspective on leadership. I used to think I was a lone ranger with no leadership skills. Now, I find I have a bit of leadership in me. Leadership is not just about having high EQ or being able to motivate others. It's about being willing to do the dirtiest jobs, bear the greatest pressure, and take on tasks that others won't. Organizing teams, finding resources, and projects, of course, it's tiring and challenging. But if you're willing to do it, you become the core of the team and the one people rely on.

Gaining users, organizing activities, becoming the admin of many groups, talking about project outsourcing teams, doing all these things, I should have confidence in my leadership abilities. Because I'm not afraid of failure, I'm not afraid that no one will come to my organized activities, I'm not afraid that no one will come to our platform live broadcast, and I'm not afraid of many people criticizing me. I hope my skin can be as thick as that of a merchant, completely indifferent to others and only concerned about whether my goods sell.

Why do big shots like Ma Yun, Ma Huateng, and Cheng Wei compete in various fields? Because the more successful they become, the more they are self-centered. They are unwilling to give their opponents an inch of territory. Only those who are stronger than their opponents can make contributions to the world and donate their wealth.

In 2018, my goal was very simple: steadily build a reputable outsourcing company, with five full-time employees by year-end, and a company income of 150 million yuan. I'd appreciate it if everyone could recommend projects to me, I can handle front-end and back-end, small programs, Apps. We're gradually moving towards AI, so please recommend AI projects to me as well. The commission for industry introductions is 20%. I understand that everyone will benefit, enabling us to work together for a long time.

Our tech stack includes PHP, Java, Go, Javascript, Vue, Objective-C, iOS, Android, Kafka, and streaming media among others.

Last year was really eventful, like riding a rollercoaster. At times, I felt invincible, boasting about serving millions of users. At other times, I felt helpless, just blowing hot air. Now, I've become more relaxed about life. Just like the stock market, to make big money, you have to bear the risk of losing big money. The more you win, the more you might lose. Winning now doesn't guarantee anything, you have to keep winning.

Life is the same way, with ups and downs. What you think is the peak of your life might be the beginning of a deep fall. What you think is a bottom, might be the start of the next victory. I have continued for 18 years, making up for all the lost money, steadily improving the company.

This year, there are so many people to thank. Firstly, I would like to thank Xiao Lai teacher and Ye Fei boss, as well as my parents. They financially supported my entrepreneurship. Xiao Lai teacher and Ye Fei boss are both very nice people. Even when I lost money, Xiao Lai teacher didn't scold me, telling me not to worry and that he wasn't adding to the chaos. He gave me the greatest freedom. Whenever there was a problem, I had to answer.

One conversation with Xiao Lai teacher. I thought, Xiao Lai teacher knew that people grow up often have to rely on themselves. He shared all his experiences in the "Getting There" column, so those who wanted to learn from him could naturally do so. I shouldn't waste too much time on Xiao Lai teacher. I thank Xiao Lai teacher, every time I approached him, he never ignored me, I knew he hadn't given up on me. Now, I am starting to earn back some money, I hope to get better and not disappoint Xiao Lai teacher's expectations.

I would like to thank Ye Fei boss. After I went to America to play for a month, he criticized me, saying that I had done nothing useful and was not trustworthy. The company was not made, and I would quit working when there was pressure. In the past, when we hired a lot of people, he reminded me. Unfortunately, I didn't listen sometimes. I appreciate my colleagues at Jiqiaobo. Those days, I wanted to sleep at 3pm, but you kept me awake, making me finish work, not letting me drag you down, thank you for your strictness.

I appreciate the colleagues at Jiqiaobo Live. In the past two months, we accomplished some things together and held an event.

I appreciate the hosts at Jiqiaobo Live. Sharing knowledge and technology with you, cooperating with you, we gained 2.7 ten thousand engineer users. Thank you, I met many developer friends through you. Jiqiaobo Live is gradually becoming known in the tech circle.

I appreciate Jiqiaobo Live's users. We had no money or resources, and we gained some users only because you shared it in your friend circles. Thank you for attending Jiqiaobo Live's activities.

I appreciate the clients, I appreciate all those who closely cooperated or partnered with us. I appreciate your trust, allowing us to help develop products. Everyone was very helpful and cooperative. I would like to thank my friends in the US, including Abbot Fang, Brother Shu, Sister Guxi, Space Ming, Wu Yusen the Great Master, and the friends from Silicon Valley's secret agents, for welcoming me during my stay in the US.

I would like to thank all my friends who have paid attention to Qi Zhilive and supported me over the past 17 years. In difficult times, it was your likes that kept me going and prevented me from giving up. I remember when I published that article about going to the US to find my ex-girlfriend, many friends expressed their concern and care for me, thank you all.

My story has been shared here, I wish everyone a happy Lunar New Year in advance!
