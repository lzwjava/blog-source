title: "ChatGPT iOS VPN Detection Becomes Less Strict"

Today, I discovered that the ChatGPT iOS app now allows logging in with a VPN in China. Previously, it displayed a blocking prompt like the one shown below:

However, as of today, it works fine with a VPN.  

I recall that in the early days of the ChatGPT iOS release, it was possible to use the app with a VPN without issues. Later, VPN detection became stricter, making it difficult to log in. Thankfully, this restriction appears to have been eased.  

Merry Christmas and thank God for this positive change! 🎄
