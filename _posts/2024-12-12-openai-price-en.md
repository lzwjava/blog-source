title: "OpenAI Should Charge Based on Token Usage Instead of a Fixed $20 Monthly Fee"
---

OpenAI should implement a flexible pricing model based on actual token usage rather than charging a fixed $20 monthly subscription.

Currently, GPT-4o is priced at $2.50 per 1M input tokens and $10.00 per 1M output tokens. For client users, a similar usage-based pricing model would make more sense.

### Proposal: Usage-Based Wallet System
To address the constraints of iOS fixed-price subscriptions, OpenAI could introduce a wallet system:

1. Users deposit funds into their wallet, with a suggested minimum top-up of $20.
2. Token usage is deducted from the wallet balance either in real-time or at the end of each day.
3. Accounts must maintain a minimum balance (e.g., $10) to ensure uninterrupted service.

### Benefits of a Usage-Based Model
- **Flexibility**: Accommodates users with varying levels of activity—low-usage users aren’t overcharged, while high-usage users pay proportionally.
- **Fairness**: Users pay only for what they consume, making the service more appealing to a broader audience.
- **Adaptability**: A wallet system integrates seamlessly with existing subscription models and offers transparency for users.

By adopting this approach, OpenAI could provide a more tailored and equitable experience for its users, maximizing satisfaction and utility.
