title: "ChatGPT Plus Should Charge Based on Token Usage Instead of a Fixed $20 Monthly Fee"
---

OpenAI should implement a flexible pricing model based on actual token usage rather than charging a fixed $20 monthly subscription.

Currently, the API pricing for GPT-4 is set at $2.50 per 1 million input tokens and $10.00 per 1 million output tokens. For client users, a comparable usage-based pricing model would be more appropriate.

### Proposal: Usage-Based Wallet System
To address the constraints of iOS fixed-price subscriptions, OpenAI could introduce a wallet system:

1. Users deposit funds into their wallet, with a suggested minimum top-up of $20.
2. Token usage is deducted from the wallet balance either in real-time or at the end of each day.
3. Accounts must maintain a minimum balance (e.g., $10) to ensure uninterrupted service.

### Benefits of a Usage-Based Model
- **Flexibility**: Accommodates users with varying levels of activity—low-usage users aren’t overcharged, while high-usage users pay proportionally.
- **Fairness**: Users pay only for what they consume, making the service more appealing to a broader audience.
- **Adaptability**: A wallet system integrates seamlessly with existing subscription models and offers transparency for users.

Although transitioning to this model may seem challenging, it is still early in the journey. Reports suggest that 300 million people use OpenAI weekly.

Based on OpenAI's projected revenue of $11.6 billion for next year and assuming most users subscribe to the $20 per month OpenAI Plus plan, the estimated number of subscribers would be approximately 48.33 million.

Implementing this flexible model would undoubtedly attract more users to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus.

By adopting this approach, OpenAI could provide a more tailored and equitable experience for its users, maximizing satisfaction and utility.
