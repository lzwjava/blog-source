Perhaps it is fate that destined me to fight against falsehoods in this lifetime. From a young age, my parents told me that there were many smart people in the world, and that if you had ability, you could have a good life. So I needed to study hard. I believed them, and I was always an excellent student. But...

(At this point, a lengthy account is omitted—please refer to my previous article *The Shattering of the Tsinghua Dream*.)

After meeting my mentor Dan Friedman, I felt I had truly learned the ability to think critically. This ability was something I had as a child but had lost through subsequent "education." My smooth experience at IU made me feel like no problem could stump me. Naively, I thought that having this genuine ability would naturally lead to satisfying work and life. But once again, I was wrong.

It wasn’t until I joined Google that I realized that the workplace wasn’t about the strongest abilities getting the best positions. On the contrary, those who were smooth talkers and adept at leveraging others’ talents were the ones who climbed to the top. In a way, that was the "shattering of the Google dream," though I never had a "Google dream" to begin with. Google often claimed, "We don’t care about your degree; if you have the ability, you’ll get a good job." Now we know those were lies.

Later, in San Francisco, I met Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python. By then, he had left Google. He said to me, "The world still values degrees. You know, I only have a master’s degree, and that puts me at a disadvantage in the corporate world." I was stunned that even Guido van Rossum would say something like that, but it was true. Now we know that the companies that once touted "we don’t care about degrees" (including Google) eventually used degrees to suppress people.

But even a PhD doesn’t solve everything. It might make things a bit easier, but not by much. Some of my PhD friends still toil away working for people without real skills. I’ve come to understand that this world is filled with falsehoods from top to bottom. From space hoaxes to nuclear weapon scams, pandemic frauds, and even fake wars—it shows that the world’s power is controlled by a few evil masters of deception. If that’s the case, how can ordinary corporate jobs be any different?

I remember how many students "got by" in college. Those who couldn’t code, or coded terribly, would always find ways to join a good team with a strong programmer. They’d then put on their act—pretending to be proactive, doing surface-level tasks like research, writing reports, or creating documentation—but avoiding any real coding. When they did write code, it was so poor it gave them away: chaotic while loops spanning hundreds of lines, poorly written functions, or fragile hacks that happened to work by luck.

Capable team members could always tell what these people were really like. But universities are "harmonious" places, so capable individuals, out of "politeness" or a sense of "friendliness," wouldn’t call them out. Professors didn’t care about such issues either; they only cared about whether the group delivered overall. And so, by attaching themselves to strong teams, these individuals graduated with "excellent" grades.

When such people enter the workplace, they use the same tactics. They leverage others’ skills, adding a few lines of their own to existing work so their names appear in the codebase. They enthusiastically contribute to documentation or research tasks but avoid actual coding. Once again, capable colleagues—out of politeness—don’t expose them. Over time, these people climb higher, eventually reaching senior leadership positions.

Because the world itself is built on falsehoods, such individuals are always promoted. The fake higher-ups promote people like themselves, as long as they can exploit those with genuine skills to do the work. This is how most companies operate, regardless of their lofty slogans or claims of being "engineer-driven" or having an "engineering culture."

People say "Life begins at forty" or that one reaches clarity at forty. But how many truly do? I didn’t. Many people live their entire lives in a grand illusion.

For me, clarity came at forty-two. At forty-two, while living in an apartment on the 42nd floor of a building in Shanghai, I uncovered the secrets of this world. At the start of the year, I had whimsically thought that since "42 is the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything," maybe this would be a year of breakthroughs for me. And it was. I gained a deep understanding of music theory, practiced the cello, viola da gamba, and Baroque flute. But my greatest breakthrough wasn’t in specific skills—it was seeing through the deceptions of the world.

This led me to investigate physics, where I began studying Einstein’s theories of relativity. Initially, I sought to understand them, but eventually, I realized they might be wrong. Herbert Dingle’s book *Science at the Crossroads* pointed out flaws in relativity, though it didn’t identify the true errors. A year later, after thoroughly reading Einstein’s papers, I understood where his "special relativity" was fundamentally flawed: the premise of "constant speed of light" is incorrect and has not been experimentally proven. The Michelson-Morley experiment’s conclusions were wrong.

From there, I uncovered more falsehoods: the AIDS scam, the pandemic hoax, the space hoax, and even the nuclear weapons hoax, where Einstein’s E=mc² laid the groundwork for the deception that "a small amount of mass can release enormous energy." 

And then came the AI hype with ChatGPT, following three years of pandemic-induced pause. The supposedly revolutionary "autonomous driving" quietly faded away.

With so many deceptions in the world, we must ask: what is real?

At forty-two, I truly found clarity. I understood that "The Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything" is indeed—42. But without seeing through the falsehoods, how could one comprehend this answer? Thus, the answer is 42, utterly meaningless.

I’m not saying life is meaningless, but that any answer to such profound questions is meaningless without first uncovering these falsehoods.
