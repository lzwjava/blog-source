: "Just Do Without Talking"
---

Don't just talk about loving parents; help with daily chores and experience their years of hard work. At least, do your part in household tasks.

Don't just say you love customers; write code, negotiate with suppliers, ensure good designs, manage employees effectively, and work efficiently every day.

Be a responsible individual. Recognize your role, who you're creating value for, and who you depend on to survive. Know your responsibilities.1. Don't discuss emotions; they are insignificant. Concentrate on interests and ensure the advantages are evident.
2. Rather than expressing love for someone, assume family responsibilities and generate income externally.
3. Avoid relying on emotions or friendships in business; maintain a businesslike demeanor, similar to dealing with strangers and online acquaintances. Present interests.
4. Learn from Apple; prioritize product development year-round and organize only two events annually. Work diligently behind the scenes and communicate only when essential.
5. As a content creator, communicate daily, but keep in mind sharing worthwhile content with others. Speaking without substance is futile. Address topics that can profit others, even strangers.1. If you don't share beneficial information, that's fine. However, you must accept the consequence of not earning money and not being able to add value to others.
2. As a short video creator, produce videos daily, ensuring they bring value, joy, or knowledge to others. If you create content solely for yourself, don't lament the absence of followers.
3. At work, concentrate on excelling in your job. Limit discussions to work-related matters. If you execute tasks efficiently and effectively, every boss will value your contribution.
4. As a leader, assess employees' interests, appraise their input and output, and determine if the wages you pay today will yield future customer returns.
5. In business, invest prudently, considering the potential future returns of each investment.1. If you lack skills and merely talk without substance, people will naturally dislike and look down on you.
2. When selling oranges, there's no need for brand storytelling; sell delicious and cost-effective oranges.
3. When selling courses or training, focus on offering excellent and cost-effective content.
4. If you want people to like you, become outstanding and share your expertise generously.
5. To make money, don't talk too much; present a great product or service with good value.1. Simplicity and common sense are the most powerful. Things don't need to be complex; they can be simple and clear.
2. Words and ideas hold value, but assess their originality, uniqueness, accuracy, and practicality.
3. When interacting with people, be thoughtful.
4. This world is practical.
5. As an adult, prioritize self-care and avoid causing harm to others. Recognize who relies on you for living.1. Don't rely on emotions, storytelling, or sentiments as people buy products, goods, or services, not emotions.
2. Emotions and storytelling often imply that your products or services are not sufficient. Relying on emotions can be perceived as manipulative.
3. In the realm of finance, be rational. Don't attempt to please those who don't require your products or services. Instead, concentrate on enhancing what you provide. Emotions are not enduring; not everyone appreciates them.
4. Adhere to fair and just business practices to foster long-term connections.
5. In the world of money, tears hold no value. Tears cannot substitute for hard work and daily exertions.1. To accomplish tasks, actively seek cooperation when necessary, but ensure you have done your best.
2. Surviving in this world is simple. Work hard to become exceptional, be dedicated, and make people need you like Apple.
3. Don't overexert yourself. Let passion drive you. If you put little effort into something, be content with the earnings. Accept the market's harsh reality when people choose other products or services over yours. Money and business have rules.
4. In society, take action instead of just talking and complete tasks efficiently. For content creators or short video makers aiming to grow, be serious in both speech and action.
5. I write this to motivate myself. Good morning, workers. Keep going, workers.
