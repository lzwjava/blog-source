[中文翻译: 如何成为世界上最锋利的人](#如何成为世界上最锋利的人)

One year ago, regarding my English ability, my reading was good, my listening was not so good, and my writing and speaking were poor. After working in a Singaporean company, four aspects of my English level are proficiency. 

I passed a lot of interview rounds recently, and got several offers from big outsourcing companies whose clients are big banks. Though I will work still as a contractor for a big bank, I am still proud of what I achieved regarding that I was a dropout student.

Regarding the poor economic environment in China, I am confident that I will not lose my job in the next 10 years. Many graduated guys lose their jobs. It is hard for many middle-aged people to find a job. Society is ruthless. I am also trying very hard to ensure that I can find a job and pay my mortgage.

I learned English a hard way. Besides my 965 work, all of my leisure hours are spent learning English. 16 hours on the weekend, 8 hours on the work days. After half a year, I find my brain changed miraculously. I become passionate about speaking and writing English, become passionate about listening and reading English. I must ensure that I have some English materials to listen to whenever my mind is awake. Of course, it is annoying when you listen to lectures and write some code at the same time. 

I love expressing myself in English now. As long as my Chinese friends can understand simple English, I will talk to them using English. I made bilingual short videos and I made bilingual captions and dubbings. I just changed myself to an English native speaker though I live in China surrounding the Chinese. 

Why? One reason is that as now I am proficient in English, it is easy for me to speak and write. Another reason is that I want to make my English level perfect. And I want to inspire more of my friends to reach the English level I got. The last reason is that using a lot of what you learned is funny. Especially not many people can do that, it is cool. And just one year ago, I couldn't do that. So, see, how miraculous it is.

So how can I learn English for 16 hours a day? If I can play mobile phone, I will happily play TikTok and Youtube Shorts. The short videos are funny. If I can't play mobile phone, I will listen to podcasts on Google Podcasts and listen to Youtube videos which you can play in the background if you are a Youtube premium member.

And what am I doing when I am listening to English lectures at the same time? Listen when driving, listen when laying in bed, listen when falling asleep, listen when eating meals, listen when walking, listen when riding a bicycle, listen when talking to others, listen when going to the toilet. So just let the English lectures play all the time, and focus a little bit some time to listen carefully and try to understand. I find in this way, I learn quite fast.

So now, my daily English and working English are proficient. I am about to make my academic English proficient. How can I do that? Same way, try to listen to a lot of academic materials. I am confident that my academic English can be quite sharp after one year.

In the above paragraph, I mention I listen to English lectures when talking to others. How can I do that? So it is on-ear headphones. 

So you can hear what others say clearly at the same time you can hear the voice from the headphone. And what other tools do I use? I find that if I wear bluetooth earphones too much, I will feel pain. 

And I also find that though I have on-ear headphones to listen to now, I still feel pain sometimes. It may be that I listen for too much time. So I bought a mobile phone rope to wear on my neck. So I can use my mobile phone to listen to lectures when there are not many people surrounding me. I will preferably use this way more than the on-ear headphone way. 

I try hard to solve the problem of how can I live well as a dropout undergraduate student. Now I can easily find a job. The global big company cares more about the English level of candidates instead of their college diplomas. And there is a lot of outsourcing company whose clients are global big companies. 

And actually, I am just one step to a permanent position at a big bank. I failed in the last round of the interview. They weren't unsatisfied with my English level. They mentioned that my technical knowledge foundation is quite good, however, I still lack a bit of knowledge deepness. 

So my answer is that if you can do the things the people who have a college diploma can't do, then you can beat them. Especially in the highly competitive and hardcore technical area, there are many chances for dropout, for the people who want to prove themselves, and for the people who want to earn a high salary. 

So I am trying hard to solve my dropout problem. I spent half a year learning 16 hours a day to solve them. However, the great lesson is that if I can learn English so fast and well, why can't I learn other things as well? 

So I am trying to polish my academic English comprehension ability. I am listening to academic lectures the whole day. I listen to lectures about how to make a rocket, how the economy works by Ray Dalio, and how to make a computer from scratch. I listen to one lecture for a whole week. At the first shot, I don't know what they are talking about. After a week, to my surprise, I can almost listen most of the words they speak and understand some main points they share. It is quite amazing. Because I originally don't think I can learn such stuff, especially since they are taught in English.

So how to become the sharpest person in the world? I think I find the answer. Just learn the whole day, the whole week, the whole year. You will be quite sharp. I will be quite sharp. 

The most difficult obstacle for me to becoming the sharpest is that I am an easily distracted guy. My concentration ability is poor. However, the good news is that when I play lectures for 2 hours, to let the voice surround my ear, then I can focus a little bit to listen carefully for 1 hour. Especially when you are driving, your eyes are looking ahead, and you are bored, so your mind has just enough attention to listen and learn something. When I drive for 2 hours, I can listen carefully for 1.5 hours. 

Is it amazing? Yes, it is quite amazing. And nowadays, new energy vehicles are becoming popular. I also bought one, NETA V Chao Lite 400. I think it is the best new energy car whose price is below 100k CNY. Young people like me in China can afford one. The car is amazing. So you drive to do a road trip without spending much money to get fuel for the car. 

And in this way, I can only get familiar with technical stuff or academic papers. Regarding most of the precious knowledge, I must do to learn. How can I learn precious knowledge? 

I find a way today. When I do something, I get anxious when I feel I am not progressing. For example, when I build some circuits or play with Arduino, I find my progress is slow. Then I give up. Now, I find the solution. It is that I can play lectures in my surrounding, then I can calmly waste time building circuits. If I don't succeed in making a successful circuit, at least I practice my English listening ability, and at least I get one percent more familiar with some words and some sentences in English. So I think if I play lectures in my home using a bluetooth speaker, then I can build circuits the whole day. If I want to have the patience to do some labor work, then I just need to play lectures to make myself relaxed to do it.

Does it sound exciting? Yes. It is really exciting to learn if you can learn very fast and without much effort. It is appealing if you have ways to learn anything. It is wonderful if you can calm down to do any labor experiment or work.

This is my way how to becoming the sharpest person in the world. Because I learn 16 hours a day, I experiment 16 hours a day, I explore 16 hours a day.

I have a daughter who is one and a half years old now. Her father learned for 27 years and used 2 hours to write the most precious lesson down. So it is dedicated to her. I am 27 years old now. It is hard for me to become the sharpest though it is still not late and I have chances. But I am very confident that my daughter will become one of the sharpest people when she grows up. 

One generation beats one generation. Humans are wonderful.

### 如何成为世界上最锋利的人

一年前，关于我的英语能力，我的阅读很好，听力不太好，写作和口语很差。在新加坡的公司工作后，我的英语水平在这四个方面是熟练的。

最近我通过了很多轮面试，拿到了几家大的外派公司的录用通知书，这些公司的客户是大银行。虽然我仍将作为大银行的合同工工作，但我仍为自己的成就感到自豪，因为我是一个辍学的大学生。

对于中国糟糕的经济环境，我有信心在未来10年内不会失去工作。许多有大学毕业证的人失去了工作。许多中年人很难找到工作。社会是无情的。我也在非常努力地确保我能够找到一份工作并支付我的房贷。

我学习英语的方式很努力。除了我的965工作，我所有的休闲时间都用来学习英语。周末有16小时，工作日有8小时。半年后，我发现我的大脑奇迹般地改变了。我变得热衷于说和写英语，变得热衷于听和读英语。我必须确保每当我的头脑清醒的时候，都有一些英语材料可以听。当然，当你在写一些代码的时候耳机放着讲座，是很烦人的。

我现在喜欢用英语表达自己。只要我的中国朋友能看懂简单的英语，我就会用英语和他们发消息。我制作了双语短视频，我还做了双语的字幕和配音。虽然我生活在中国，但我把自己变成了一个以英语为母语的人。

为什么呢？一个原因是，由于现在我熟练英语，对我来说，说和写都很容易。另一个原因是，我想让我的英语水平更完美。而且我想激励我的更多朋友达到我的英语水平。最后一个原因是，使用你学到的东西是很有趣的。特别是没有多少人能学会的时，这很酷。而就在一年前，我还做不到这一点。所以，看，这是多么神奇的事情。

那么，我怎么能一天学16个小时的英语呢？如果我能玩手机，我会很开心地玩TikTok和Youtube Shorts。这些短视频很有趣。如果我不能玩手机，我会在谷歌播客上听播客，听Youtube视频，如果你是Youtube高级会员，你可以在后台播放。

那我在听英语讲座的同时在做什么呢？开车的时候听，躺在床上的时候听，睡着的时候听，吃饭的时候听，走路的时候听，骑自行车的时候听，和别人说话的时候听，上厕所的时候听。因此，只要让英语讲座一直播放，有时专心一下仔细听，试着理解。我发现通过这种方式，我学得相当快。

所以现在，我的日常英语和工作英语已经很熟练了。我正准备让我的学术英语熟练起来。我怎样才能做到这一点呢？同样的方法，尝试听大量的学术材料。我有信心，一年后我的学术英语可以相当锋利。

在上面的段落中，我提到我在与他人交谈时听英语讲座。我怎么能这样做呢？原来是非入耳式耳机。

所以你可以清楚地听到别人说的话，同时你可以听到耳机里的声音。那我还用什么工具呢？我发现如果我经常戴蓝牙耳机，我会感到疼痛。

而且我还发现，虽然我现在有非入耳式耳机来听，但有时还是会感到疼痛。这可能是我听的时间太长了。所以我买了一个手机绳，戴在脖子上。这样我就可以在周围人不多的时候用手机听讲座了。比起非入耳式耳机的方式，我更愿意使用这种方式。

我努力解决作为一个辍学的本科生如何能生活得好的问题。现在我可以很容易地找到一份工作。全球大公司更关心候选人的英语水平，而不是他们的大学文凭。而且有很多外派公司，他们的客户是全球大公司。

而实际上，我离一家大银行的长期职位只有一步之遥。我在最后一轮的面试中失败了。他们并不是对我的英语水平不满意。他们提到，我的技术知识基础相当好，但是，我仍然缺乏一点知识的深度。

所以我的回答是，如果你能做到那些有大学文凭的人做不到的事情，那么你就能打败他们。特别是在竞争激烈的硬核技术领域，辍学生的机会很多，对于想证明自己的人来说，对于想获得高薪的人来说。

所以我正在努力解决我的辍学问题。我花了半年的时间，每天学习16个小时来解决这些问题。然而，伟大的教训是，如果我可以把英语学得这么快、这么好，为什么我就不能把其他东西也学好呢？

因此，我正在努力磨练我的学术英语理解能力。我整天都在听学术讲座。我听的是关于如何制作火箭的讲座，瑞达利奥老师的社会经济是如何运行的分享以及如何从头开始制作一台电脑的分享。我听每个讲座听了整整一个星期。刚开始的时候，我不知道他们在说什么。一周后，令我惊讶的是，我几乎可以听懂他们讲的大部分单词，并理解他们分享的一些主要观点。这是很惊人的。因为我原本不认为自己能学到这样的东西，尤其是以英语来讲述。

那么，如何成为世界上最锋利的人呢？我想我找到了答案。只要整天、整周、整年都在学习。你就会变得相当锋利。我将变得相当锋利。

对我来说，要成为最锋利的人，最困难的障碍是我是一个容易分心的人。我的注意力集中能力很差。然而，好消息是，当我播放2个小时的讲座，让声音围绕着我的耳朵，接着我可以集中一点注意力，认真听1个小时。特别是在开车时，眼睛看着前方，很无聊，所以头脑中的注意力刚好可以用来听和学习一些东西。当我开车2小时时，我可以认真听1.5小时。

这很神奇吗？是的，这是相当惊人的。而现在，新能源汽车正在变得流行。我也买了一辆，哪吒V潮Lite 400。我认为它是价格低于10万人民币的最好的新能源汽车。在中国，像我这样的年轻人可以买得起。这辆车是很棒的。所以你开车去自驾游时，不需要花很多钱为汽车加油。

而这样一来，我只能熟悉技术上的东西或学术论文。关于大部分珍贵的知识，我必须通过实践来学习。我怎样才能学到宝贵的知识呢？

我今天找到了一个方法。当我亲手做一件事的时候，我发现我很焦虑，因为它进展很慢。例如，当我构建一些电路或玩Arduino时，我发现我的进展很慢。然后我就放弃了。现在，我找到了解决办法。就是我可以在我的周围播放讲座，然后我可以平静地把时间浪费在构建电路上。如果我不能成功地建立一个电路，至少我可以锻炼我的英语听力能力，至少我对英语中的一些单词和一些句子多了百分之一的熟悉。所以我认为，如果我在家里用蓝牙音箱播放讲座，那么我就可以一整天都在构建电路。如果我想有耐心做一些劳动工作，那么我只需要播放讲座，让自己放松地去做。

这听起来很刺激吗？是的。如果你能非常快速地学习，而且不费吹灰之力，这确实是令人兴奋的事情。如果你有办法学习任何东西，那就更美妙了。如果你能静下心来做任何体力劳动实验或工作，那就太棒了。

这是我如何成为世界上最锋利的人的方法。因为我每天学习16个小时，我每天实验16个小时，我每天探索16个小时。

我有一个女儿，现在一岁半。她的父亲学了27年，用2个小时把最宝贵的经验写下来。所以，这篇文章是献给她的。我现在已经27岁了，我很难成为最锋利的人，虽然现在还不晚，我还有机会。但我很有信心，我的女儿长大后会成为世界上最锋利的人之一。

一代人打败一代人。人类是美好的。
