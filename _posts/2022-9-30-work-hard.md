The recipe to work hard and study English

Recently, I shared my job change to my friends. For their suprise, the big change about me may be my English skill improved a lot in a year.

I already share the article about how to learn English. Let me summarize my total effort to learn English after graduating from high school.

7 years to use Google search to read English website. Half an year to play in TikTok or Youtube Shorts for at least 6 hours. Watch Netflix around 100 TV shows and movies. Read about 30 English books. Use English to work in an international big company. Listen Google Podcast for at least 4 hours in half an year.

See, these are my total effort. Does it seem that it is realy hard work? It may seems a lot of work. However, actually, I don't feel any pain in these process. Do you learn your mother language paifully? No, you don't. So I just make learning English like learning mother language.

I think everyone in Chinese can reach the level I got. It helps me to pass the English technical interview of big company. I heard that only in 1 of 50 developers, there are just one guy can speak English fluently.

I joined DBS(Development Bank of Singapore) as contractor. Before I joined the company, my reading is good, and my listening is not so good, and my writing and speaking is poor. 

I know that when at first day of my work, I only type English word for 5 words in a minute. However, after serveral months, I found that I can type 20 words in a minute. I still have some grammer errors in my writing. However, at least, I can express what I want to say and collegues can understand well.

My collegues say that the English environment is realy important. Yes, it is. However, to these days, we can use Internet to mock the English environment. Youtube, Netflix, Google Podcast is really good.

So I took an TOFEL Exam. However in the process of taking exam, my computer adapter isn't plugged in and the screen turned off. After I plug in the adapter in 15 seconds, the teacher can't see me. So I canceled the test. I will retest in the exam in the golden week. In a mock exam, I can get the 80 to 90 scores of 120. However, I am afraid that in the real exam, whether I can get that points. The listening and reading is hard. Also, I don't like to prepare the exam. The idea that we sit before the computer and to practice the exam like a student will kill me. It is so painful. I don't have that kind of self discipline.

I can use my own way to learn English and I feel that my English skill really improve a lot. So why do I try to prepare the exam to do better in the exam? I know there are a lot of reasons. But I don't like that way.

So when I feel that my English ablity improve a lot. However the test beated me. So I begin to listen to Podcast in my daily commute. So I try to walk for 2 or 3 hours daily to wear bluetooth earphone to listen Podcast. The Lex Friedman Podcast is really good. I listen to the speaking of Steve Jobs and Tony Fadell a lot.

So I just listen to Podcast around 5 hours a day. After serveral months, I notice my brain changes. I can use English to express faster. When I want to say something, my brain quickly know how to say it. Just like using Chinese. 

So then I think if I can use this way to learn English, why not Japanese or Hardware? or whatever what you like.

My insight is that your brain is easy to distract. So if you let your brain in an environment, then it can focus some time. So if I let my brain emerge in 5 hours English talk, then my brain can focus to listen it about 2 hours. Then I can feel that I learned fast!

So this is my recipe to work hard. And I start to learn hardware and chips. I listen to the capicitor and transistor whole day. So I can think it again and again. The electricty just like an flow, the electical component just like the software library. The electrical parameter just like the API of the software. You can gain more insights about thinking and listening them for long hours in a day.

I am a very lazy people. If I can do it, anyone can do it. In modern highly competive day, you really need to work hard to be great. I am glad that I find the way to work hard. And it is very funny. I don't feel painful.

See, I just use one hour to write this article. And just half an year ago, I feel very painful to write one sentence myself. 

Let's end with my recently favourite quote.

> The difference between a good student and a great one is that a good student is concerned more about the outcome while a great one is fascinated by the process of learning.

And, friends, long time no see, hope you guys all doing well.
