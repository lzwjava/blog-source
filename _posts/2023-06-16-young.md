title: "To the 10 yo's me, how to become an information genius"
---

I am now 28 years old. The 10 years old is like yesterday when I think about it. It was 2004. Around September, I came to Guangzhou, a big city in China from a village in Guangdong. I was born in 1995 January. So actually the title should be 9 years old. But somehow it is more convenient to say to the 10 yo. That year is special to me because I first met the computer in my father's working place. It was a tunnel monitor building. Inside it, some computers were showing videos about the traffic inside the tunnels captured by CCTV cameras. 

At that time, I couldn't imagine what it will be like when I grow up, when I became a father just like my father. I probably never think about this problem when I was that young. 18 years passed by, and now, it is 2023. And it will be history soon.

I of course have so many things that I want to share with the 10 yo's me. It is hard to make it with one article. Among this, I especially want to tell him about how to become an information genius.

During those years after I first met the computer, I of course like other young primary school students, liked to play games. And from 13 yo, in 2008, I started to participate in the National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces. And after several years, in 2011, I made it to the second round to compete with around 360 top students in Guangdong Province, which has around 100 million population. I got no luck and even the third prize didn't give to me. The third prize can probably reach out to the students with the top 200 scores. So I was ranked about the place around 300.

And then I went to university and then dropped out, went to work in a startup, and then created my startup. And now I was working as a full stack engineer for a global big bank through the contract way.

In the last year passed by, I have had tens of moments where I am feeling like I am an information genius. When I want to confirm it with some of my colleagues, they said yeah, a bit, sometimes I have innovative ways to do things. When I answered some questions for our newly joined Chinese engineers, somehow, they complain a bit about how hard it is to work in a global company for the first time working this way. The language problem, the lot of access raising, the tons of information, the no mentor and few can help the problem, the busy boss problem. 

Actually, in my first time working at a Singaporean big bank in 2022, I was doing badly. And my boss was nice to help me change a group. In the second group, I started to shin. My new boss praised me as I was excellent among four or five Chinese engineers in the group. 

And now it is June 2023, and in the last half a year, I began to shin not only among Chinese teammates but among Hong Kong teammates. My boss said that he is happy to see that I am eager to learn. Though I still need to learn a lot from my boss and my genius teammates, let me say so to celebrate the small success.

I have hobbies to update my resume and the skills inside it. Let me show the skills I have experiences:

5 or more years of using experience: Chinese, English, Java, Spring, Algorithm, TDD, Linux, Windows, MacOS, Writing, Database, Redis
3 to 5 years of using experience: C++, iOS, Android, Vue, HTML, CSS, DevOps, Cantonese, Alibaba Cloud
1 to 3 years of using experience: Product Management, PHP, C++, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, Python, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Kafka, Network, RTMP streaming, Pascal
less than 1 year of using experience: Hardware, Go, Ruby, Big Data, Machine Learning, Japanese, AWS, ChatGPT, Elasticsearch

Though experience here strictly is not the working experience. Probably it is better to name it as using experience.
