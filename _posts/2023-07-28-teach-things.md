title: "Bring Up Kids Like a Millionaire or a Scientist"
---

In the previous title, I say I will teach my daughter to use and enjoy all these things.

These are some miscellaneous products I am using now. 

### Explaination

Above things are some selected things I am using now. And the knowledge I have obtained in 28 years' life. I am an engineer, startup founder, blogger, and lifelong learner. The three keywords that help me guide my life are truth, freedom and love. My mission is to do experiments for humans. I am writing this essay to discuss how to raise kids with my genius friends. 

### Teach Kids Like a Billionaire

If you are a billionaire, how will you raise your kids? In my observation, they will bring their kids to travel around the world. Like Eileen Gu. Her life experience is really colorful. Her mother is excellent. 

And one thing is that make the kids grow up with less pain as possible. They are so small. They already have a hard life to grow up. Why we still force them to do things they don't like? 

And I think we should have more patience for our kids. I just accompany my 2 yo daughter for one day in a week. Actually, I want my wife give birth to a second kid and let me bring up totally. That's really interesting. 

I am a person who likes freedom. I couldn't imagine how much freedom I can bring to the kid myself bring up. 

Paul Graham is a well-known figure in the tech world, and he’s also one of the wealthiest. And Paul Graham’s net worth is an estimated $2.5 billion. He shares a lot about stories with his kids. A lot of these stories are really funny. He wrote an essay titled as "Having Kids" in 2019.

So for him, his kids are totally ok to sleep whenever they want. So I think it is probably wrong to let kids sleep at some regular time. To be honest, for adults myself, I can't do that. 

So you know, why these days a lot of people want to work as a freelancer or remotely? It is not that they aren't self-disciplined. It is that they don't want to scrafice that sleep freedom for money. They want to earn money without limiting any of their freedom. Now, they are minority in the 7 billion population. But surely, the group of people who have sleep freedom will become much more. 

As a engineer, in my corporate life, I have observed that a lot of execellent engineers work like a night owl, or that they come to the office in the noon, or that they have daily standup at 10am in their home, they will come to the office after that.
