title: "How to Bring Up Best Kids"
---

I can say my own family is a millionaire household though my parents give us half a million CNY. I can say I am a truly scientist though I have not been recongized in the world with some reputation around my friends. So let's talk about how to bring up kids like a millionaire or a scientist.

If you are a billionaire, how will you raise your kids? In my observation, they will bring their kids to travel around the world. Let's think about Eileen Gu. Her life experience is really colorful. Her mother is excellent. 

And one thing is to make the kids grow up with less pain as possible. They are so small. They already have a hard life to grow up. Why we still force them to do things they don't like? 

And I think we should have more patience for our kids. I just accompany my 2 yo daughter for one day in a week. Actually, I want my wife to give birth to a second kid and let me bring up totally. That's really interesting. 

I am a person who likes freedom. I couldn't imagine how much freedom I can provide for the kid I am bringing up myself.

Paul Graham is a well-known figure in the tech world, and he’s also one of the wealthiest. And Paul Graham’s net worth is an estimated $2.5 billion. He shares a lot about stories with his kids. A lot of these stories are really funny. He wrote an essay titled as "Having Kids" in 2019.

So for him, his kids are totally ok to sleep whenever they want. So I think it is probably wrong to let kids sleep at some regular time. To be honest, for adults myself, I can't do that. 

So you know, why these days a lot of people want to work as a freelancer or remotely? It is not that they aren't self-disciplined. It is that they don't want to scrafice that sleep freedom for money. They want to earn money without limiting any of their freedom. Now, they are a minority in the 7 billion population. But surely, the group of people who have sleep freedom will become much more. 

As a engineer, in my corporate life, I have observed that a lot of execellent engineers work like a night owl, or that they come to the office in the noon, or that they have daily standup at 10am in their home, they will come to the office after that. 

I don't like that my parents force me to do anything I don't want to. I already have a hard life. Why they still want me to do things I don't want to? Now, I earn a decent money a year to the standard of the big cities in China. I have confidence and boldness to judge. I know what is right and what is not. I clearly know what my actions will give the impacts to the world. 

Let's discuss about dropout again. Dropout without a colleage degree is not ok in China. However, dropout without a colleage degree in the USA is ok. OpenAI is now probably the best company in the world. You can check out their job requirements in their website. https://openai.com/careers. This is one of the job requirements about one job. 

* Have experience with ML systems, particularly high scale distributed inference for modern LLMs.

Other requirements are just like this. They don't mention any degree or diploma any more. 

And this is other job requirements from some global company.

* Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science Engineering or equivalent, Software Engineering or a related subject.
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related discipline, or equivalent practical experience.

I have to say OpenAI are doing best in the hiring. They think like me. If you truely belive that Interent is the best school in this world, and the traditional schools are becoming obsolete, then you will know why OpenAI do this. Other companies will surely follow them. 

And please note this paragraph in their job requirements. 

> We are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability or any other legally protected status. Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records. 

The gaps between the wealthy and the poor are so large now. And the people likes to play with others who have similar money or knowledge with them. The billionares don't want to play with milliionares because this is very different for them to see the world. That makes opinions conflicts or uncomfortableness. 

So the kids will be similar too. If my plan is right, when my daughter can speak English fluently at 6 years old, how can she play all day long with other Chinese kids who are just able to speak few simple words. It is not about the language. My daughter surely will speak Chinese at that time. They can communicate. However, it is about how they see this world, it will make a lot of conflicts one day.

And my daughter has no responsiblity to teach her friends English. And it is hard to teach. If my daughter can speak English fluently, that is because his dad has speaking English with her for 4 years, that's from 2023 to 2027. That is because his dad prepares the International Home TV, iPad or iPhone for her to watch English animations often.

That's why Singaporean or Hong Konger still somtimes find that they are hard to communicate with their Chinese colleagues. One reason is the language problem, one is different technology mindset. Though the parents of them are from China too. It is a generation about 25 years. With 25 years living in different environments, they become different in minds or behaviors. 

At technology areas, this phenomenon are not so outstanding. Because the Internet workers are quite same globally. They will pursue the latest Internet technology. Actually it depends too. The world a staff engineer in Google see is quite different from the junior engineer who are just graduated from a Chinese university. 

Now, the technology world is really developing fast. The future OpenAI sees is different from that Google sees, so it reflects on their job requirements. 

Come back to the school education. I have some classmates who are teaching in schools in China. And Some of my teachers who taught me before got retired recently. I know how school system works in China. 

So to my observation, and sorry for being not humble, I have to say that I probably knew a lot more than the young teachers in China. Yeah, but I don't have time to teach my kid when she goes to school. 

And sorry for being honest to share, I have some foreign friends in China, they want to come back to their home countries to give the best school education for their kids. I also follow some Chinese influencers in social media platforms who bring up their kids in foreign countries.

They somehow don't trust the school system education in China. When ones have seen or experienced better education, they couldn't accept the poor ones. Like after I got my iPhone 14 Pro Max, I don't want to use iPhone X any more though few days before I thought they are still ok to use with sometimes cleaning up the storage. 

If we see bringing kids as a competition, this competition is really really intense. Their kids are very good and excellent. I think I already think hard and work as hard as I can to bring my kid. But actually, they are thinking and working harder. 

There are nine subjects in China's College Entrance Exams. Chinese, English, Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, Politics. If I prepare for one month and take exams again, I properly can take 70% score of each subject. I got around 590 scores in 750. It is about 78% scores. 

The things you understood will be eaiser to learn next time. There is a saying like that education is that which remains when one has forgotten everything he learned in school.

It is thinking ability that matters. Every small things in life have a lot in them to be learned if you observe or think carefully. 

Like recently I onboarded to my new home. I bought a Sensology Formaldehyde Dectector to detect the air quality. I don't want to read product instructions guide though I have patience to read them if I want. I just go to test. I can test in the outside open areas. I can test in every places in my apartment. I can learn things by real testing and think about the differences with those test results.

It is quite like the code. I have 15 years programming experience since I started to program from 13. I don't need to read documents though I have patience to read them. Even they are written in Japanese, I am ok to translate them and walk through them. I am comfortable to listen to Japanese though my Japanese reading ability is still poor. So the source code is my best reference. I just go to directly run them up to learn.
