title: "Asbstraction"
---

* Everything is about asbstraction.

* Design, software, products, physics, reversing myopia, startups, business, users, strategy, countries, programming languages, variables, and concepts are all about abstraction.

* Asb is a way of meta-thinking.

* By abstracting things in a high level, you summarize things and can handle them in a batch. It is like a function or a method. It is like summarization in writings. It is like table of contents. It is company structure. 

* You can abstract things in differnt aspects. 

* The standards for abstraction are what we need to think about. It is like how we extract or organize the code.

* We want to organization things by level and level. The level just interacts with adjacency 

* If there is a problem or a bug, you can find the problems by walking from high level. You should trace down the root cause. It is like the corruptions of a country. They usually happens in some specific groups or people. 

* The bad aspects for abstraction is that it involes some high level. Individual has more freedom in this world. The rules for a high level may not be suitable for the all objects including that levels.

* Things change. We may need to refactor code to have better abstraction. We may reorganize company structure to better reflect the business to serve the customers.

* Think about the standard between every levels. Do they have some patterns? If they have, it can be written as lambda code to construct high level order function.
