Perhaps it is fate that determines that I must struggle with falsehoods in this lifetime. Since I was young, my parents told me that there are many intelligent people in this world and that having abilities leads to a good life, so I should study hard. I believed them, and my academic performance has always been good. But...

(Here, ten thousand words are omitted. Please refer to my previous piece, "The Shattering of the Tsinghua Dream.")

After meeting my mentor Dan Friedman, I felt that I had acquired true thinking abilities. These thinking abilities were present in me since childhood but were lost during later "education." Due to my smooth progress at IU, it seemed like nothing could challenge me, and I naively believed that with these genuine abilities, I could have a satisfying job and life. Once again, I was mistaken.

It was only when I arrived at Google that I discovered that being capable does not necessarily lead to good positions within the company. On the contrary, those who can talk and manipulate others' abilities are the ones who rise to the top. One could call it the "Shattering of the Google Dream," although I did not have any specific "Google dream." Google always used to tell people, "We don't care about degrees from schools; if you have the ability, you can have a good job." Now we all know that these were lies.

Later, in San Francisco, I met Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, who had already left Google at that time. He said to me, "Degrees still matter in this world. You know, I only have a master's degree, and it puts me at a disadvantage in the company." I didn't expect even Guido van Rossum to say such things, but he was speaking the truth. Now we know that the companies that once advocated "not caring about degrees" (including Google) later used degrees to suppress people.

But what difference does having a PhD make? It does provide some convenience, but not much more. Some of my friends who have earned their PhDs are still toiling away for people who lack actual skills. I now understand that this world is fundamentally filled with falsehood from top to bottom. There are all kinds of space scams, nuclear weapon scams, pandemic scams, and even wars can be fake, indicating that the entire world's power is in the hands of certain evil masters of deception, let alone regular corporate jobs.

Do you remember how many students managed to get by in university? Those who couldn't write code or wrote it poorly always found a way to join a good team with someone who was skilled in programming. They would then perform their play, putting on an act of being proactive and hardworking, conducting surveys, writing documents, and the like, except for writing code. As soon as they attempted to write even a little code, their incompetence would be revealed because it was completely unreadable, extremely messy, and confusing. For example, a while loop spanning hundreds of lines, various continue and break statements, no knowledge of helper functions, and somehow managing to get by without encountering issues, passing through by bluffing.

Of course, capable team members could easily see their lack of skills. However, universities are very "harmonious," so capable people often refrain from pointing out these problems due to "politeness" and "friendliness." Professors in universities also don't care about these matters; they only care about the overall performance of a small group. Thus, these individuals manage to graduate with "excellent" grades by blending into a good team. In this way, certain individuals graduate with "outstanding" results.

Once these individuals enter a company, they continue to use the same tactics to blend in. They always rely on others' abilities. When others have done most of the work, they add a few lines of code to have their names appear in the codebase. Of course, they are always enthusiastic about various documentation and "research," but they cannot write code. However, those with true programming skills, out of the same consideration for "politeness," still refrain from exposing them. These individuals climb higher and higher by showcasing their textual abilities, eventually reaching high-level leadership positions.

Due to the inherent falsehood from top to bottom in this world, such individuals are always promoted. Since the top-level positions are fake, they promote individuals similar to themselves who can deceive those with genuine abilities into doing the work. This is the operating model of most companies. No matter how lofty their slogans are, promoting themselves as an "engineering company" or having an "engineering culture," it's all the same.

People often say that one becomes enlightened at the age of forty, but how many people truly reach the age of forty without confusion? I certainly didn't. Many people live their entire lives in a huge dream.

I didn't achieve "clarity at forty," but I achieved it at forty-two. In that year, in an apartment on the forty-second floor of a residential complex in Shanghai, I saw through the secrets of this world. Due to my previous successful endeavors in painting and learning Japanese, at the beginning of that year, I humorously thought that since "42 is the ultimate answer to the universe," maybe at the age of forty-two, I would learn many things and make breakthrough progress. Indeed, that year I learned many things. I gained a deep understanding of music theory and simplified it to the point where I could explain it clearly in an afternoon. I practiced the cello, the viola da gamba, and the Baroque flute. However, my greatest breakthrough was not in specific knowledge and skills but in seeing through the secrets of this world.

Later, I suddenly felt that if I had made so many breakthroughs in art and music, perhaps I should spend some time understanding science as well. So I started delving into physics, and that's when I noticed Albert Einstein's theory of relativity... Initially, I wanted to "study" relativity and truly understand it. But later, I realized that it might be wrong. I discovered Herbert Dingle's book, "Science at the Crossroads," which pointed out the errors in relativity.

Actually, Dingle didn't discover the real errors in relativity, so although I had already doubted Einstein, I didn't know precisely where he was wrong. It was only a year later that I truly understood Einstein's papers and comprehended where his "special theory of relativity" went wrong—the premise of "the constant and unchanging speed of light" was incorrect and never truly confirmed by experiments. The conclusions of the Michelson-Morley experiment were wrong.

The "general theory of relativity" based on the special theory of relativity, and even E=mc^2, are incorrect (false) and were prepared to facilitate a multitude of other false sciences and nuclear weapon scams. Einstein himself was likely just an actor; he didn't understand many things and could only rely on his iconic messy hairstyle photos and some pretentiously profound quotes to confuse people. Even in the few remaining film recordings of him, he couldn't improvise and stumbled through simple equations like E=mc^2 when not reading from a script. It's no wonder he never dared to publicly debate with other scientists.

But at that time, this was a seed that made me start doubting everything in this world, including the person who told people to "doubt everything"—René Descartes. I discovered that Descartes was also a fraud. In his book "Meditations," he claimed one should doubt everything, empty their mind, and reconstruct all knowledge from scratch. Yet, after "emptying all the contents from his mind," he said, "Now I only know one thing for certain—the existence of God." He was clearly referring to the God in the Bible, and that's when I knew he was a fraud. His entire "Meditations" is nonsense.

Due to being confined by the pandemic, I suddenly felt that maybe I should spend some time understanding what the "pandemic" is all about. Perhaps the pandemic has issues? I asked a friend who likes studying politics, and he often tells me how evil the United States is, so I guessed he might have done some research. And I was right; he had studied the pandemic, and he told me it was probably created by the likes of Bill Gates and Fauci.

However, he didn't discover where the pandemic is false. He believed that certain villains with advanced technology created the novel coronavirus, but he didn't realize that perhaps the concept of a "virus" doesn't exist at all. Later, he surprisingly went ahead and eagerly received three doses of the vaccine, all from domestic manufacturers, because he despised the United States and supported domestic vaccines. Fortunately, he is still alive.

Through further exploration, I discovered the book "Virus Mania," which claims that all "viruses" in the world are fake, and the entire field of virology is pseudoscience. Nobody has scientifically proven the existence of viruses. Later, I found out that the claim "viruses don't exist" originated from a German biologist named Stefan Lanka. I didn't fully believe Stefan Lanka's words, but I specifically read two formally published virology papers that were supposed to prove the existence of the novel coronavirus. As Stefan Lanka claimed, none of them conducted proper scientific control experiments, and their conclusions regarding this crucial issue were vague.

Then I started to discover that AIDS is a hoax. I came across the works of Kary Mullis and Peter Duesberg. These two individuals are not conspiracy theorists but respected scientists with verifiable credentials. Peter Duesberg wrote an entire book, "Inventing the AIDS Virus," exposing the hoax of the "AIDS epidemic," revealing the falsehoods of virology and pointing out how they often use "circular reasoning" to prove the "existence of viruses." Many people fail to see the connections, but I believe the scripts of the "AIDS hoax" and the "COVID-19 hoax" are identical and performed by the same group of actors.

I believe Stefan Lanka is right; there are no viruses in the world. However, Stefan Lanka didn't discover where the "symptoms" come from. None of the people proclaiming that "viruses don't exist" have found where the "COVID-19 symptoms" originate from either. Some individuals who initially propagated the idea that "viruses don't exist" started promoting the notion that "COVID-19 symptoms are caused by 5G electromagnetic waves." That's when I confirmed that these individuals are also actors, playing the role of "opposition" assigned by the Matrix to confuse people's minds. Through my experiences in China and the various bizarre encounters in the UK, I confirmed that the "symptoms" are likely caused by secretive poisoning operations (smog, airplane contrails, "air fresheners" in public places, and more).

Next, I discovered the "space scams," "nuclear weapon scams," and more. Einstein's E=mc^2 was probably paving the way for the "nuclear weapon scam," making people believe that "a minuscule amount of matter can be converted into tremendous energy." After the pandemic subsided, the "AI scam" that was put on hold for three years due to the pandemic resurfaced, and the once highly praised "autonomous driving" disappeared from the spotlight.

There are so many scams and illusions in the world. Perhaps what we should contemplate is what is truly real?

So, at forty-two, I truly became enlightened. I understood the "ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything" to be—42. If we cannot see through all these falsehoods, how can we understand the "ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything"? Therefore, the answer to this question can only be 42, without any meaning.

I'm not saying that life has no meaning, but answering profound questions without seeing through these illusions is meaningless.

Zhiwei's comment: Zhiwei successfully reduced his myopia by 100 degrees within a year by wearing glasses that reduced the actual degree by 150, surpassed every eye doctor and expert. This proves that what Yin Wang said is reasonable. He is truly eccentric, always taking things so seriously. He points out that many aspects in the areas such as relativity, space, medicine, and artificial intelligence are scams. Why Yin Wang is so arrogant? Just because he did experiments and thinkings? Zhiwei can do too! Zhiwei will prove he is wrong! Zhiwei will fight for half of the human achievements!
