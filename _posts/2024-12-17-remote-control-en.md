title: "Use a Remote Control Small Handle to Control Your iPhone"  
---

In 2019, I began using my iPhone more extensively and started watching TikTok videos. However, I was using a lazy bracket mount to hold my phone, which made it difficult to reach the screen and swipe between videos. To address this issue, I purchased a Bluetooth remote control small handle that supports both iOS and Android devices.

In 2022, I invested in another remote control small handle specifically for controlling my iPhone while driving. With one hand on the steering wheel, I can effortlessly use the other hand to navigate through apps, adjust settings, or control media playback using the handle's up and down buttons.

This remote control small handle is not only useful for managing TikTok but also versatile enough to take selfies and handle other iPhone functions, enhancing both convenience and safety.
