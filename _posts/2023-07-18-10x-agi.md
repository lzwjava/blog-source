title: "The 10x AGI Information World"
---

10x here means 10 times. AGI stands for "Artificial General Intelligence." So, I use three adjective words to describe the future world. And 16 million people in the world might be aware that the future will be the AGI world. Midjourney has around that user account as of July 2023. And ChatGPT had 100 million users in January 2023. So if we choose a number to define the count of serious AI tool lovers, we probably want to choose 16 million. ChatGPT is a text conversation tool, it is simple and direct. And Midjourney is a tool to help generate images by AI algorithms. That's the tool serious lovers will try.

10x means that it is really fast. And it has no question to say this world is Information World as the number of Internet users in the world reached 5.160 billion people
