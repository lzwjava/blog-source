title: "Using Developer Mode of iPhone"
---

I was once an iOS developer for some time. But my career focus has shifted to other technologies. However, it is still very useful to apply iOS development knowledge even though I am not a professional iOS developer now.

Recently, I wanted to share my installed apps. But if I took screenshots of all apps from the home screen or from the app list in settings, it would be a mess. So I needed to find a way to view all installed apps.

Here are the steps to view all installed apps using Xcode:

1. Connect your iPhone to your Mac via USB
2. Open Xcode
3. Go to Window → Devices and Simulators (or press Shift + Cmd + 2)
4. Select your iPhone from the left sidebar
5. In the main panel, scroll down to the "Installed Apps" section
