title: "Giffgaff Experience"

Giffgaff offers a new mobile phone SIM card service. I have never experienced anything like this in China. The Chinese telecom providers - China Telecom, China Unicom, and China Communications - are old-fashioned and bureaucratic compared to it. Giffgaff is young, dynamic and clean.

But it is a UK card. We better use it in the UK or EU.

We can use the roaming data in the EU and selected destinations. In China, it is expensive. Just surfing the Internet for several minutes will cost several pounds.

I also installed Deliveroo, a British online food delivery company. But actually, it doesn't need a UK phone number to register. A Chinese number is OK too.
