* Cooking for yourself is simple. Use oil for stir-frying because it has a higher boiling point than water, which helps heat the food more effectively.  
* It is easy to make a dish with meat, vegetables, chili, garlic, and ginger.  
* Making soup is easy with an electric cooker. Add the ingredients, season with salt, set the timer, and let it cook.  
* A grill oven can be used to make egg tarts, lamb, beef, pork, hot dogs, mushrooms, and more. For meat, set the temperature to 200°C and cook for about 20 minutes.  
* For outdoor cooking, you’ll need a fire. Dried leaves can be used to start the fire. Find a container to hold the food for cooking, or even use a tile as a makeshift pot.  
* A rice cooker can also be used to heat food, not just rice. However, keep in mind that vegetables tend to release water, which can make the rice too wet. Add only a small amount of water if you’re cooking vegetables in the rice cooker.  
* A cooking robot is a convenient tool for making dishes. Simply add the ingredients and let the robot handle the stirring.
