### Common Drawbacks of Working as a Contractor at DBS Bank

Based on employee reviews and discussions from platforms like Glassdoor and Reddit, here are some frequently mentioned challenges for contractors at DBS Bank (primarily in Singapore). Keep in mind these are anecdotal experiences and can vary by role, team, and location:

- **Second-Class Treatment**: Contractors often feel undervalued, receiving emails or communications intended for permanent staff by mistake, and being excluded from certain company events or perks.
  
- **Job Insecurity**: Contracts are frequently not renewed without much notice, and contractors are typically the first to be let go during budget cuts or restructurings. Permanent roles offer more stability, including severance and notice periods.

- **Limited Benefits and Perks**: No access to the full suite of employee benefits (e.g., health insurance, bonuses, or training programs) that permanent staff enjoy. Pay might be decent, but the lack of extras makes it feel less competitive long-term.

- **Stagnant Career Growth**: Little opportunity for promotions, skill development, or conversion to permanent positions unless a full-time role opens up (which is rare). Many describe it as a "dead-end" unless you're using it as a short-term stepping stone.

- **Poor Work-Life Balance**: High-pressure environment with long hours, especially in tech or operations roles, and expectations that match or exceed those of permanent staff without the same support.

- **Budget-Driven Instability**: Frequent cost-cutting measures can lead to sudden project halts or team reductions, leaving contractors in limbo.

Overall, while DBS is praised for learning opportunities and a modern culture, contractors often advise taking such roles only if you're desperate or need quick experience—aim for permanent positions elsewhere for better long-term prospects.
