Here are some of the most impactful and insightful economists and business thinkers:

1. **Adam Smith**: Known as the "father of modern economics," Smith's work, particularly "The Wealth of Nations," laid the foundation for classical free market economic theory. He advocated for free trade and market competition, which still influence economic policies today.

2. **John Maynard Keynes**: Keynes is famous for his theories on how governments should intervene in the economy to mitigate recessions and depressions. His ideas, known as Keynesian economics, have been widely adopted during economic crises.

3. **Milton Friedman**: A strong advocate for free markets, Friedman's work on consumption analysis, monetary history, and theory has significantly influenced economic thought and policy, particularly during the Reagan era in the United States.

4. **Alfred Marshall**: Marshall is credited with developing the graphical representation of supply and demand curves, which is fundamental to economic analysis. His work turned economics into a more scientific discipline.

5. **Michael Porter**: Recognized as one of the most influential management thinkers, Porter's work on competitive strategy and the value chain has shaped modern business strategy and management practices.

6. **Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee**: These economists pioneered an experimental approach to alleviating global poverty, using randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of policies. Their work has become a standard in development economics.

These thinkers have made significant contributions to the fields of economics and business, shaping policies and practices worldwide.
