title: Total Training Time Estimate

Let’s compute your total training time clearly and compactly.

---

## **Given**

* Your iteration time stabilizes near **~3.9 seconds per iteration** (from iter 100–200).
* Total iterations = **6000**.
* You already finished ≈ **200** iterations (not important since you asked “totally”).

We’ll estimate using the steady-state time, not the slow first iteration.

---

## **Step-by-step (simple)**

**Time per iteration:**
≈ 3.9 seconds

**Total time:**
6000 × 3.9 s
= 23,400 seconds

Convert:

* /60 ≈ **390 minutes**
* /60 ≈ **6.5 hours**

---

## **Final estimate**

### **≈ 6.5 hours of total training time**

(on your RTX 4070 with this NanoGPT 125M config)

If your iteration time improves slightly as PyTorch compile warms up, final time may fall to **6.0 hr**. If GPU is slightly busier or dataset slowdowns appear, expect **6.5–7 hr**.

If you want, I can also compute ETA for other configs (256M, 350M, 1.3B, longer context, different GPU, etc.).
