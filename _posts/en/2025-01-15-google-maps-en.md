title: Using Google Maps in China

While Google Maps' data in China may not be as current as AMaps or Apple Maps (which also relies on AMaps data), it remains a usable option, especially with features like setting intermediate stops for navigation.

One notable challenge is the inconsistent English representation of Chinese locations. For instance, "Longguang fengjing huating" might be translated as "Longguang Peak Huating," blending pinyin and English. Searching directly with Chinese characters can sometimes be more effective.

Despite these limitations, Google Maps offers some advantages. For example, it provides useful information like store closure times, as seen when searching for a Wanda Plaza late at night.

Beyond Google Maps, Telegram's live location sharing feature is a convenient tool, allowing you to share your location for a specified duration, such as 15 minutes.

Personally, I've used Apple Maps frequently and Google Maps occasionally. Both are less convenient than AMaps, which is generally considered the best mapping app in China.

However, using Google Maps can offer a different perspective on Chinese locations and, with practice, can be a valuable tool for exploring the world.
