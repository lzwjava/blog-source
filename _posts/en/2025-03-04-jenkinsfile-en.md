title: Writing a Jenkinsfile

To write a Jenkinsfile that incorporates a shared library, a string parameter, a try-catch block, a node block, and an if statement, you can use the following approach. Jenkinsfiles are written in Groovy and can define a pipeline to automate build, test, and deployment processes. Below is a complete example of a scripted Jenkinsfile that meets these requirements.

First, to use a shared library, you need to import it with the `@Library` annotation. Shared libraries in Jenkins contain reusable code that can be called from multiple pipelines. For example, if your shared library is named `my-shared-library`, you include it at the top of the Jenkinsfile like this:

```groovy
@Library('my-shared-library') _
```

The underscore (`_`) after the annotation is required to properly import the library.

Next, to define a string parameter, use the `properties` step. This allows users to pass a string value to the pipeline when it runs. Here's how to add a string parameter named `MY_STRING`:

```groovy
properties([
    parameters([
        string(name: 'MY_STRING', defaultValue: 'default', description: 'A string parameter')
    ])
])
```

The `node` block specifies where the pipeline executes, such as on any available agent. Inside this block, you can include your pipeline logic:

```groovy
node {
    // Pipeline steps go here
}
```

To handle potential errors, wrap your steps in a `try-catch` block. This ensures that if something fails, you can catch the exception and handle it gracefully. Additionally, an `if` statement can be used to make decisions based on the value of the string parameter (`params.MY_STRING`).

Here’s the complete Jenkinsfile combining all these elements:

```groovy
@Library('my-shared-library') _

properties([
    parameters([
        string(name: 'MY_STRING', defaultValue: 'default', description: 'A string parameter')
    ])
])

node {
    try {
        // Call a function from the shared library (assuming it exists)
        myLibraryFunction()
        
        // Use an if statement based on the string parameter
        if (params.MY_STRING == 'test') {
            echo "Running test"
        } else {
            echo "Not running test"
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        echo "An error occurred: ${e.message}"
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Components

- **`@Library('my-shared-library') _`**: Imports a shared library named `my-shared-library`. Replace `my-shared-library` with the actual name of your library. The function `myLibraryFunction()` is assumed to be defined in this library.
- **`properties`**: Defines a string parameter `MY_STRING` with a default value of `'default'` and a description. You can access this parameter in the pipeline using `params.MY_STRING`.
- **`node`** : Runs the pipeline on any available agent. You can specify a particular agent (e.g., `node('linux')`) if needed.
- **`try-catch`**: Executes the steps inside the `try` block and catches any exceptions in the `catch` block, printing an error message if something goes wrong.
- **`if`**: Checks if `MY_STRING` equals `'test'` and prints a message accordingly. You can modify the condition and actions as needed.

### Notes
- This example assumes a scripted pipeline, which offers more flexibility with Groovy syntax. If you need a declarative pipeline instead, the structure would differ slightly (e.g., using `pipeline` and `script` blocks for Groovy code).
- The `myLibraryFunction()` call is a placeholder. Ensure that your shared library defines this function, or replace it with an actual function from your library.
- You can expand this Jenkinsfile by adding stages (e.g., `stage('Build')`) or more complex logic depending on your requirements.

This Jenkinsfile provides a solid foundation that includes all the elements you requested: a shared library, a string parameter, a try-catch block, a node block, and an if statement. Adjust the specifics (library name, function calls, or conditions) to fit your use case!
