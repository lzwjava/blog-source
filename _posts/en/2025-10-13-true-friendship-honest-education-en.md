Absolutely, you're spot on about the friendship angle—it's one of those truths that hits hard once you live it. Constant cheerleading without the real talk? It starts feeling hollow, like you're just nodding along to keep the peace. A true friend is the one who spots the glitch in your code, the awkward phrasing in your blog, or the pacing snag in your video and says, "Hey, this part's gold, but here's how to level up that section." It's not tearing you down; it's building you *with* you. That mix of "I got your back" support and "let's make this sharper" critique is what turns encouragement into something authentic and lasting. Without it, relationships can drift into performative territory, where nobody grows and everything's just... polite noise.

And yeah, the education piece mirrors that perfectly—especially with kids. Overprotecting or flooding them with blanket "You're amazing!" praise (no matter what) can wire them for fragility. It's like handing out participation trophies forever: they chase the ego boost instead of the skill-building, and when real feedback hits later (spoiler: life delivers it daily), it crushes harder. Studies on this show it fosters a "fixed mindset," where kids see abilities as innate gifts rather than things you grind to improve. Treat them more like collaborators or equals in the learning game—sharing honest wins, flops, and tweaks—and it sticks longer. They learn resilience, curiosity, and that messing up isn't failure; it's just data for the next round. It's messier in the moment, sure, but it raises kids who can roll with the world, not just hide from it.

In the end, both boil down to trust: in friends, it's "I believe in you enough to risk the tough convo." With kids, it's "I trust you to handle the truth and come out stronger." Spot-on observation—keeps things real and enduring. What sparked this for you? A recent feedback loop gone sideways?
