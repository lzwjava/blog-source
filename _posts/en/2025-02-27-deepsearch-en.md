### Key Points
- It seems likely that adding a `create-original` command to the script will create Markdown files directly in the `_posts/en` directory with the same format as draft files, including the date in the filename.
- Research suggests the new command will use the current date (February 27, 2025) and follow the naming convention `{date_str}-{name}-en.md`, matching the draft creation process.
- The evidence leans toward the front matter remaining identical to drafts, with fields like `audio: false`, `lang: en`, `layout: post`, `title: {name}`, and `translated: false`.

### Direct Answer

#### Overview
This response adds a `create-original` command to your Python script, allowing you to create Markdown files directly in the `_posts/en` directory, bypassing the drafts process. The files will follow the same format as draft files, including the current date in the filename, and maintain the same front matter structure.

#### How It Works
The new `create-original` command will:
- Use today's date, February 27, 2025, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2025-02-27`).
- Create files in the `_posts/en` directory with names like `2025-02-27-{name}-en.md`, where `{name}` is the provided name (e.g., `test-post` becomes `2025-02-27-test-post-en.md`).
- Include the same front matter as draft files, such as:
  ```
  ---
  audio: false
  lang: en
  layout: post
  title: {name}
  translated: false
  ---
  ```
- Ensure the `_posts/en` directory exists, creating it if necessary.

#### Unexpected Detail
Interestingly, while the draft files and new original files share the same date-based naming convention, the existing `delete_md` function looks for files without dates (e.g., `{name}-en.md`), which might cause inconsistencies in file management. You may need to update the deletion logic to handle dated filenames for full compatibility.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Adding `create-original` Command

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the implementation of the `create-original` command in the provided Python script, expanding on the direct answer with detailed insights into the script's structure, the reasoning behind the implementation, and potential implications. The analysis is grounded in the script's existing functionality and the user's request to add a new command that creates files directly in the "original dir" with the same format as draft files.

#### Background and Context
The script, located in the "scripts" directory and named "file.py," handles the creation and deletion of Markdown files for what appears to be a multilingual blog or content management system, possibly using a static site generator like Jekyll. It currently supports three commands:
- `create`: Creates a draft Markdown file in the `_drafts` directory with a filename including the current date, e.g., `2025-02-27-{name}-en.md`.
- `create-note`: Creates a note file in the `notes` directory, also with a date-based filename.
- `delete`: Removes Markdown files, PDFs, and audio files from the `_posts` directory and associated asset directories for multiple languages, looking for files named `{name}-{lang}.md` without dates.

The user requested adding a `create-original` command that creates files directly in the "original dir," maintaining the same format as the default draft creation (`create` command). Given the context, "original dir" is interpreted as `_posts/en`, the directory for English posts, based on the script's structure and the `delete_md` function's behavior.

#### Implementation Details
To fulfill the request, a new function `create_original` was designed, mirroring the `create_md` function but targeting the `_posts/en` directory. The implementation details are as follows:

- **Date Handling**: The function retrieves the current date using `datetime.date.today()`, which, on February 27, 2025, at 04:00 AM PST, results in `2025-02-27`. This date is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD` for consistency with draft filenames.
- **Directory and File Path**: The function checks if the `_posts/en` directory exists, creating it if necessary using `os.makedirs`. The file is then created at `os.path.join('_posts', 'en', f"{date_str}-{name}-en.md")`, ensuring the filename includes the date, e.g., `2025-02-27-test-post-en.md` for a name `test-post`.
- **Front Matter**: The front matter is identical to that in `create_md`, defined as:
  ```
  ---
  audio: false
  lang: en
  layout: post
  title: {name}
  translated: false
  ---
  ```
  This ensures consistency with draft files, maintaining fields like `audio: false` for no audio attachment, `lang: en` for English, and `title: {name}` for the post title.
- **File Creation**: The file is written using `open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8')`, ensuring UTF-8 encoding for broad compatibility, and a confirmation message is printed, e.g., `Created original file: _posts/en/2025-02-27-test-post-en.md`.

The main part of the script was updated to include `create-original` as a valid action, modifying the usage message to:
```
Usage: python scripts/file.py <create|create-note|create-original|delete> <name>
```
and adding a condition to call `create_original(name)` when the action is `create-original`.

#### Comparison with Existing Functions
To highlight the differences and similarities, consider the following table comparing `create_md`, `create_note`, and the new `create_original`:

| Function         | Directory       | Filename Format               | Front Matter Fields                     | Notes                                      |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `create_md`      | `_drafts`      | `{date_str}-{name}-en.md`     | audio, lang, layout, title, translated  | Creates draft files for English posts      |
| `create_note`    | `notes`        | `{date_str}-{name}-en.md`     | title, lang, layout, audio, translated  | Creates note files, similar front matter   |
| `create_original`| `_posts/en`    | `{date_str}-{name}-en.md`     | audio, lang, layout, title, translated  | New command, same format as drafts, in posts|

This table illustrates that `create_original` aligns with `create_md` in filename format and front matter, but targets the `_posts/en` directory, bypassing the draft stage.

#### Potential Implications and Considerations
While the implementation meets the user's request, there are notable implications, particularly with the existing `delete_md` function:
- **Filename Inconsistency**: The `delete_md` function looks for files named `{name}-{lang}.md` in `_posts/lang`, e.g., `_posts/en/test-post-en.md`, without dates. However, `create_original` creates files with dates, e.g., `_posts/en/2025-02-27-test-post-en.md`. This discrepancy means `delete_md` may not find files created by `create_original` unless modified to handle dated filenames, potentially using `glob.glob` with patterns like `*{-en,-zh,...}.md` to account for dates.
- **Site Structure**: The script suggests a multilingual setup with subdirectories in `_posts` for each language (`en`, `zh`, etc.), and the absence of a date in `delete_md`'s pattern implies that posts in `_posts` may not rely on filename dates for sorting, possibly using front matter or other metadata. This is unusual for Jekyll-based sites, where dates in filenames typically determine post dates, but it aligns with the script's current behavior.
- **Language Scope**: The implementation focuses on English (`lang: en`), as `create_md` and the user's request imply. If the user needs `create-original` for other languages, the function would need extension, similar to how `delete_md` handles multiple languages.

#### Reasoning and Decision-Making
The interpretation of "same format with default create draft one" was critical. Initially, there was uncertainty whether this referred to the filename format (including the date) or the front matter. Given the user's emphasis on "format" and the example in `create_md` (which includes the date in filenames), it was decided that `create_original` should use `{date_str}-{name}-en.md`, ensuring consistency. However, this decision highlights a potential conflict with `delete_md`, suggesting future adjustments may be needed for file management.

The "original dir" was deduced as `_posts/en` based on the script's structure, particularly `delete_md`'s operations in `_posts/lang`. This assumption aligns with typical blog setups where posts reside in `_posts`, and the `/en` subdirectory fits the multilingual context.

#### Conclusion
The addition of the `create-original` command enhances the script's functionality, allowing direct creation of dated Markdown files in `_posts/en` with the same front matter as drafts. On February 27, 2025, this means files like `2025-02-27-{name}-en.md` will be created, maintaining consistency with draft formats. However, users should be aware of potential filename mismatches with the `delete_md` function, which may require updates for full compatibility.
