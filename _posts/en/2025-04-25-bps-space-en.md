**BPS.Space**, run by Joe Barnard, is celebrated for its groundbreaking work in advanced model rocketry, particularly for achieving feats like propulsive landings with solid-fuel rockets—a challenge even for professional aerospace companies. Here’s why BPS.Space stands out, drawing parallels to the qualities seen in innovators like Peng Zhihui (Zhihuijun):

1. **Technical Innovation**: Joe Barnard, a self-taught engineer with a music production degree from Berklee (2014), has pioneered model rocketry advancements without formal aerospace training. His flagship achievement is the **Scout rocket**, which successfully landed propulsively using solid motors—a feat likened to SpaceX’s liquid-fueled landings but on a smaller scale. By developing the **Signal flight computer** and **AVA flight computer**, he enables thrust vector control (TVC) for stability, eliminating the need for fins and mimicking real rocket flight profiles. His custom solutions, like vectoring motors to manage inconsistent thrust for landing, showcase ingenious problem-solving.[](https://hackaday.com/tag/bps-space/)[](https://bps.space/about)

2. **Open-Source and Community-Driven**: Like Peng, Joe fosters a community of hobbyists by selling products like the Signal R2 TVC kit and sharing detailed YouTube tutorials (e.g., his video on landing solid-fuel rockets). His iterative design process—starting with basic CAD models and refining through experimentation—inspires others to learn hands-on. Posts on Reddit show enthusiasts building TVC rockets inspired by Joe, with some even replicating his designs using 3D printers and Arduino.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPS_Space/)[](https://medium.com/the-systems-engineering-scholar/bps-space-the-story-of-iterative-design-2d4e42ee982)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketry/comments/dg43gz/would_like_to_do_something_similar_to_bps_space/)

3. **Creative Engineering**: Joe’s projects push boundaries with creativity. For example, the **Avalanche rocket** tests guidance systems and gimballed cameras for a future Kármán line attempt (100 km). He’s also customized GoPro HERO10 Bones cameras for compact, high-quality footage, addressing overheating and fit issues with Dremel precision. His whimsical “meat rocket” project and plans for a Starship-inspired belly-flopping model reflect a playful yet ambitious approach, akin to Peng’s quirky builds like the Hanwen keyboard.[](https://hackaday.com/tag/bps-space/)

4. **Engaging Storytelling**: As a former videographer, Joe’s YouTube channel (with videos like the Scout landing garnering 245 votes on Reddit) combines technical depth with accessible, high-quality visuals. His ability to explain complex control systems—like GNSS-guided ascents or PID algorithms for TVC—makes rocketry approachable, earning him a cult following (e.g., 5,926 Facebook likes, 1,673 LinkedIn followers). Fans on X praise flights like Sprint Flight 8 for their stability, showing his knack for captivating audiences.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/xavk3e/after_8_years_bps_space_can_finally_stick_the/)[](https://www.facebook.com/bps.space/)

5. **Solo Resilience and Work Ethic**: Operating BPS.Space largely alone, Joe funds it through Patreon, YouTube ad revenue, flight computer sales, and sponsorships, having transitioned from self-funding via wedding videography. His persistence over eight years to achieve a solid-motor landing, despite setbacks (e.g., inconsistent motor ignition timing), mirrors Peng’s relentless drive in building robots like Dummy in months. Joe’s choice to avoid live streams to reduce stress during launches reflects a disciplined focus on precision.[](https://bps.space/about)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketry/comments/mllctd/does_anyone_know_what_happened_with_bps_spaces/)

6. **Inspiring the Next Generation**: BPS.Space’s mission is to provide hands-on learning for aspiring engineers, scientists, and astronauts. By offering affordable kits (e.g., Signal R2 at $349) and sharing failures alongside successes, Joe democratizes rocketry. Reddit threads highlight hobbyists seeking his body tube sizes (66mm/74mm) or building TVC rockets from scratch, proving his influence. His story of learning via YouTube tutorials and textbooks resonates with self-learners, much like Peng’s open-source ethos empowers DIY roboticists.[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bps-space)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketry/comments/q63mxg/bpsspace/)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketry/comments/dg43gz/would_like_to_do_something_similar_to_bps_space/)

### Critical Perspective
While Joe’s achievements are remarkable, some limitations exist. His reliance on commercial propellants (Estes black powder or Aerotech APCP) and outsourcing complex propellant work may constrain scalability compared to Peng’s in-house hardware designs. ITAR restrictions prevent international shipping of his Signal kits, limiting global reach, as seen in Reddit complaints from European fans. Additionally, as a one-person operation, BPS.Space faces scalability challenges—Joe himself notes the stress of launches and his small team (occasionally one intern). Some Reddit users question if his low-thrust motors are a design choice or a necessity due to control limitations. Nevertheless, his ability to achieve SpaceX-like landings on a shoestring budget is unparalleled in amateur rocketry.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketry/comments/fjkwhx/bps_space/)[](https://www.rocketryforum.com/threads/questions-about-bps-space-system.158760/)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPS_Space/)

### Comparison to Peng Zhihui
Both Joe Barnard and Peng Zhihui excel due to their self-taught expertise, open-source contributions, and ability to make complex tech accessible. Peng’s strength lies in integrating AI and robotics (e.g., Dummy’s Atlas AI processor), while Joe focuses on control systems and rocketry dynamics. Peng’s corporate backing (Huawei) and startup (Zhiyuan Robotics) give him more resources, whereas Joe’s solo, crowdfunded model highlights raw grit. Both inspire through iterative design and community engagement, but Joe’s niche in rocketry—a field with fewer amateur players—makes his breakthroughs uniquely impactful.

In short, BPS.Space is “so good” because Joe Barnard combines technical prowess, creative engineering, and compelling storytelling to push model rocketry to new heights, inspiring a generation of hobbyists while tackling challenges that rival professional aerospace feats.[](https://tormach.com/bps.space)
