That's a very insightful point from Peter Thiel, as it challenges a common piece of advice.

The traditional advice to **"live every day as though it's your last"** is generally meant to encourage:
* **Urgency:** Don't put off your dreams or important conversations.
* **Presence:** Focus intensely on the current moment, savoring it.
* **No Regrets:** Act in a way that you won't regret when your time is up.

Thiel, however, takes **the opposite tack**, suggesting you should **"live every day as though it's going to go on forever."** This perspective encourages:

### 1. The Value of Long-Term Projects and Planning
* If you treat every day as potentially your last, you might only focus on short-term gratification or quick fixes.
* By treating life as a long, continuous journey, you're motivated to **start ambitious, long-term projects** that require years of sustained effort (like building a significant company, mastering a difficult skill, or investing for the distant future).
* It encourages **strategic thinking and patience** over immediate results.

### 2. Deeper Relationships and Accountability
* The conventional advice could inadvertently encourage burning bridges—you might behave poorly if you believe you'll never see someone again.
* Thiel's perspective means you **treat people well**, build trust, and invest in relationships because you know you'll interact with them again and again. It enforces a high degree of **personal accountability** for your actions and reputation over time.

### 3. Fighting Complacency and Stagnation (Thiel's Anti-Aging View)
* Thiel is a well-known advocate for life extension and fighting the "problem of death." This quote is deeply tied to his philosophy that we should not simply accept the finite nature of life.
* Living as if it will go on forever is an **ideological rejection of resignation**. It implies that you should continuously seek progress, improvement, and solutions (even to the problem of aging and death), rather than accepting limits.

### 💡 In summary, you can understand the word this way:

| Perspective | "Live as if it's your last day" | "Live as if it will go on forever" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Presence and immediate action. | The future, planning, and long-term consequences. |
| **Relationships** | High-intensity, potentially fleeting connection. | Investment, trust, and sustained accountability. |
| **Projects** | Quick wins, essential bucket-list items. | Ambitious, multi-year endeavors. |
| **Underlying Belief**| Life is short and finite. | Life is a continuous, *fightable* journey. |

Thiel's advice is a call for **intentional longevity and strategic building**. It asks you to adopt the mindset of an architect building a monument, not a traveler enjoying a one-day stop.
