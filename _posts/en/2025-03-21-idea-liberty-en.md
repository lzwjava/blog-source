Yes, IntelliJ IDEA can debug applications running on WebSphere Liberty Server. Here’s how and what options are available:

### Liberty Tools Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA
Similar to the Liberty Tools plugin available for Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA also has its own **Liberty Tools plugin**, developed by the Open Liberty project (which WebSphere Liberty is based on). This plugin provides integrated support for WebSphere Liberty Server, including:

- **Starting the server in development mode** (Liberty dev mode), which supports automatic redeployment of code changes and integrated debugging.
- **Debugging capabilities**, allowing you to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables directly within IntelliJ IDEA.

This plugin offers a seamless debugging experience comparable to what Eclipse provides with its Liberty Tools plugin. You can install it from the IntelliJ IDEA plugin marketplace.

### Alternative Choice: Remote Debugging
If you prefer not to use the plugin or need a more manual approach, you can debug your application using **remote debugging**. Here’s how:

1. **Start WebSphere Liberty in debug mode**:
   - Configure the server to enable debugging, typically by adding JVM arguments like `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:8000` to the server’s startup command or `server.xml`. The port (e.g., 8000) can be customized.
2. **Set up a remote debug configuration in IntelliJ IDEA**:
   - Go to `Run > Edit Configurations`, add a new `Remote JVM Debug` configuration, and specify the host (e.g., localhost) and the debug port (e.g., 8000).
3. **Attach the debugger**:
   - Start the server, then run the remote debug configuration in IntelliJ IDEA to connect to the server and begin debugging.

This method works universally with any Java application server, including WebSphere Liberty, and doesn’t require a specific plugin.

### Summary
- **Yes**, IntelliJ IDEA can debug applications on WebSphere Liberty Server.
- **Does it have a Liberty Tools plugin?** Yes, it has one similar to Eclipse’s, offering integrated debugging and server management.
- **Other choices?** You can use remote debugging as an alternative, which is a standard, plugin-free option.

Both approaches are effective, with the Liberty Tools plugin providing a more streamlined experience and remote debugging offering flexibility.
