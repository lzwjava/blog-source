To show the console in Safari, follow these steps:

1. Open Safari on your Mac.
2. Go to the menu bar at the top and click on **Safari** > **Settings** (or **Preferences** if you're using an older version).
3. Click on the **Advanced** tab.
4. At the bottom, check the box that says **"Show Develop menu in menu bar"**.
5. Close the Settings window.
6. Now, in the menu bar, you’ll see a new **Develop** option. Click on **Develop** > **Show JavaScript Console** (or **Show Web Inspector** depending on your version).

Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut **Option + Command + C** (⌥ + ⌘ + C) once the Develop menu is enabled to quickly open the console.

If you’re on an iPhone or iPad, Safari doesn’t natively show a console, but you can enable it by connecting your device to a Mac via USB, opening Safari on the Mac, and using the Develop menu to inspect the iOS device’s browser.
