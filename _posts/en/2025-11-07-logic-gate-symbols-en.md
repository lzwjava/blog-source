### Logic Gate Symbols in Digital Circuits

In digital electronics, logic gates are the building blocks of circuits that perform basic operations like AND, OR, NOT, etc., on binary signals (0s and 1s). Each gate has a standard symbolic shape used in circuit diagrams (schematics) to represent its function. These symbols are defined by standards like ANSI/IEEE 91 or IEC 60617. I'll explain the "triangle" (which I assume you mean by "trigle") and the AND gate shapes below, and address your question about whether the triangle is "not right."

#### AND Gate Shape
- **Appearance**: The AND gate symbol looks like a **D** shape:
  - Straight vertical line on the left (where multiple inputs enter).
  - Curved semicircle on the right (where the single output exits).
- **Meaning**: It represents logical AND operation. The output is **1 (true/high)** only if **all inputs** are 1. Otherwise, output is 0.
- **Example**: If inputs A=1 and B=1, output=1. If A=1 and B=0, output=0.
- **Why this shape?** The straight input side allows for easy connection of multiple wires, and the curve symbolizes the "confluence" of signals.

#### Triangle Shape
- **Appearance**: A simple **triangle** (often pointing right), sometimes with a small circle (bubble) at the pointed tip (output).
  - Without circle: This is a **buffer gate** (or non-inverting amplifier). It just passes the input signal unchanged, often used to boost signal strength.
  - With circle: This is a **NOT gate** (or inverter). The circle indicates inversion.
- **Meaning**:
  - Buffer (plain triangle): Output = Input (no change).
  - NOT (triangle + circle): Output = opposite of Input (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0).
- **Example for NOT**: Input=1 → Output=0; Input=0 → Output=1.
- **Why this shape?** The triangle evokes an arrow or amplifier, common in analog circuits for op-amps (operational amplifiers), but in digital logic, it's simplified for buffers/inverters.

#### Is the Triangle "Not Right"?
- No, the triangle is **absolutely correct** as a standard symbol—it's not a mistake or outdated. However:
  - It might look "wrong" if you're confusing it with the AND gate (which is D-shaped, not triangular).
  - In some hand-drawn diagrams or non-standard notations, shapes can vary, leading to mix-ups.
  - If you're referring to a specific circuit diagram where a triangle seems misplaced (e.g., used for AND instead), that could be an error—AND is always the D shape in proper schematics.
  - Note: Triangles are more common in **analog circuits** for op-amps (triangular symbol for amplification), but in **digital logic**, they're strictly for buffers/NOT.

If this doesn't match what you saw (e.g., share a description of the diagram), feel free to clarify! For visual examples, search "logic gate symbols" online.

#### Quick Comparison Table
| Gate Type | Shape Description | Inputs | Output Logic | Example Use |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **AND**  | D-shaped (straight left, curved right) | 2+ | 1 only if all inputs=1 | Decision-making (e.g., both switches on) |
| **Buffer** | Plain triangle → | 1 | Same as input | Signal boosting |
| **NOT**  | Triangle with circle at tip →○ | 1 | Inverted input | Flipping signals |
