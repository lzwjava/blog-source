- Use rocks, leaves, branches, and twigs to build a furnace.

- Burn for around half an hour to make the rocks red-hot.

- Open a door at the top to put food in; remember to put all the food in at once. After closing the door, it is difficult to remove or add food.

- Buy extra aluminum foil to avoid running out.

- Be careful about overcooking. We may add a layer of aluminum foil to protect the food.
