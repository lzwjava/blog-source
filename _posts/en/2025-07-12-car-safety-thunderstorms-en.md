title: Stay Safe in a Metal Car During Storms
translated: false
type: note

Yes, it is generally safe to sit in a car during a thunderstorm with rain, as long as it's a hard-topped vehicle with a metal roof and sides, and all windows are closed. The metal body of the car acts as a Faraday cage, directing any lightning strike around the occupants and into the ground via the frame and tires, rather than through the interior. This provides better protection than being outdoors or in an open structure. However, it's not because of the rubber tires alone—they play a minor role, and the car could still sustain damage like blown tires, electrical issues, or even a fire if struck directly. Convertibles, motorcycles, or vehicles with fiberglass/plastic shells offer no such protection and are unsafe. If possible, avoid driving in poor visibility from heavy rain, and pull over safely until the storm passes.

That said, it is *not* safe to park or sit in the car under a tree during a thunderstorm. Trees are often tall and isolated, making them prime targets for lightning strikes, which could cause a "ground charge" to spread outward from the tree's base (potentially electrocuting nearby people or objects, including a car). Additionally, a struck tree might splinter, drop heavy branches, or fall entirely onto the vehicle, causing severe damage or injury—especially in heavy rain and wind that can weaken limbs. Sheltering under trees is one of the worst choices during a leading cause of lightning-related casualties. Instead, if you're in a car, park in an open area away from trees, poles, or other tall objects.

In any thunderstorm, the safest place overall is indoors in a sturdy building. If that's not an option, a closed metal car (not under a tree) is a good alternative, but stay inside for at least 30 minutes after the last thunder.
