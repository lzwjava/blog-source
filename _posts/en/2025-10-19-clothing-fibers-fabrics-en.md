### Common Fibers and Fabrics Used in Clothing

Clothing is made from a variety of fibers, which can be natural (from plants or animals) or synthetic (man-made from chemicals). Polyester is one of the most common synthetic fibers, valued for its durability, wrinkle resistance, and low cost. Below is a table of some of the most widely used ones, including their origins and typical applications.

| Material       | Type       | Description & Common Uses |
|----------------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Cotton**    | Natural (plant) | Soft, breathable, and absorbent; ideal for t-shirts, jeans, and underwear. |
| **Polyester** | Synthetic | Strong, quick-drying, and affordable; used in sportswear, blends for shirts, and fleece. |
| **Wool**      | Natural (animal) | Warm and insulating; common in sweaters, suits, and coats. |
| **Nylon**     | Synthetic | Elastic and lightweight; found in hosiery, activewear, and outerwear. |
| **Silk**      | Natural (animal) | Smooth and luxurious; used for dresses, blouses, and scarves. |
| **Rayon**     | Semi-synthetic (plant-based, chemically processed) | Soft and drapey; popular in summer dresses and linings. |
| **Spandex (Lycra)** | Synthetic | Highly stretchy; added to jeans, leggings, and swimwear for flexibility. |
| **Acrylic**   | Synthetic | Wool-like warmth at lower cost; used in sweaters and hats. |
| **Linen**     | Natural (plant) | Crisp and breathable; great for shirts and summer suits, though wrinkles easily. |
| **Denim**     | Natural (cotton-based) | Sturdy twill weave; staple for jeans and jackets. |

These materials are often blended (e.g., cotton-polyester) to combine benefits like comfort and durability. Trends shift toward sustainable options like organic cotton or recycled polyester due to environmental concerns.
