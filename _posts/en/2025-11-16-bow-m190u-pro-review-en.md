Good question. Here’s a breakdown of how the **[B.O.W M190U Pro]()** (aka “hangshi / 航世 M190U”) mouse performs, plus some pros, cons, and whether it’s a good pick depending on your use case.

---

## ✅ What’s Good About It

1. **Ergonomic Vertical Design**

   * The M190U Pro is a vertical mouse, which helps keep your wrist in a more natural posture and can reduce wrist strain over long periods. ([MyFone][1])
   * It has a detachable magnetic palm rest, which is pretty thoughtful — you can remove or reattach it depending on comfort. ([MyFone][1])

2. **Multiple DPI Settings**

   * It supports 4 DPI levels: 800, 1200, 2400, and 3200. ([MyFone][1])
   * This gives flexibility: you can tune the sensitivity depending on whether you're doing productivity tasks, light editing, or just web browsing.

3. **Silent / Quiet Buttons**

   * The buttons are designed to be relatively quiet, which is a plus for office or shared environments where clicking noise matters. ([Senao Online][2])
   * No need for software to configure — it’s plug-and-play. ([Senao Online][2])

4. **Affordable**

   * Very budget-friendly. For instance, at some points it's been sold for ~49.9 元（人民幣） in JD. ([ZOL DIY][3])
   * In Taiwan, common listings are around NT$599 for this model. (See the product links above.)

5. **Good for Long Use**

   * Because of its ergonomic design + quiet clicks, it’s especially suitable for long-duration office work, studying, or regular desktop use.
   * The build quality is basic but feels decent for the price — not a premium gaming mouse, but solid for what it is.

## ❗ Potential Drawbacks / Things to Be Careful About

1. **Limited Side Buttons / Features**

   * It doesn’t emphasize a lot of extra buttons — it's more “business / office” than “gaming with macro buttons.”
   * According to the PChome spec, side buttons might not be fully supported in all systems (e.g., on Mac the side button might not work). ([PChome 24h][4])

2. **Build / Durability**

   * While the price is low, you might not get the same durability or premium feel as more expensive brands. For budget vertical mice, it's always a trade-off.

3. **Warranty**

   * According to the seller page, the warranty is only 6 months for non-user-damage issues. ([MyFone][1])
   * If you’re hard on peripherals, this could be a risk.

4. **Sensor / Precision**

   * There’s not a ton of publicly available highly technical review for its sensor performance (e.g., jitter, lift-off, etc.). For very precise work (like competitive gaming or detailed graphic design), this might not be ideal.

5. **Not Wireless (for Pro version)**

   * This Pro version is wired via USB-A, so if you prefer a wireless setup, this isn’t it. ([MyFone][1])
   * Cable length is moderate: listed as 1.5 m. ([MyFone][1])

## 💡 My Verdict: Is It a Good Choice?

* **Yes**, if you’re looking for a **cheap ergonomic mouse for office/work use** — especially if you suffer from wrist fatigue and want a vertical grip to reduce strain.
* **Less ideal** if you want a high-performance gaming mouse, or something with pro-level sensor specs, or multi-device wireless functionality.
* Also consider how much you value **durability vs cost**: for this price, you’re paying more for ergonomics than long-term premium build.
