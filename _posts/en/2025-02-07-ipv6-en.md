title: SSH connection using IPv6 address
translated: false
---

I'm trying to connect to a machine in Hetzner Cloud using IPv6. `ssh 2a01:4f8:c17:2000::/64` doesn't work, but `ssh root@2a01:4f8:c17:2000::1` does. 

The IPv6 address was copied from the Hetzner Cloud console.

The `~/.ssh/config` file can be configured to apply different proxy rules for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. This setup allows you to specify a proxy command for IPv4 addresses while handling IPv6 addresses differently. 

```bash
Host 192.168.1.*
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa 
Host *.*.*.*
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ProxyCommand corkscrew localhost 7890 %h %p
Host *
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa   
```

When running `ssh root@192.168.1.3`, the following output shows the SSH client applying configuration options from the `~/.ssh/config` file:

```bash
debug1: Reading configuration data /Users/lzwjava/.ssh/config
debug1: /Users/lzwjava/.ssh/config line 1: Applying options for 192.168.1.*

debug1: Executing proxy command: exec corkscrew localhost 7890 192.168.1.3 22
```

The SSH connection speed was noticeably slow, so I reverted to the following simpler configuration:

```bash
Host 192.168.1.*
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa 
Host *
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa  
    ProxyCommand corkscrew localhost 7890 %h %p 
```

The issue arises when using IPv6 addresses with the `ProxyCommand corkscrew localhost 7890 %h %p` directive, as this proxy command may not handle IPv6 addresses correctly.

The configuration above is still not working. However, the one below is fine.

```bash
Host 192.168.1.*
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa 
Host !192.*.*.*
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa  
    ProxyCommand corkscrew localhost 7890 %h %p 
Host *
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa  
```
