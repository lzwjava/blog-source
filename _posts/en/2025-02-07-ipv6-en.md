title: SSH connection using IPv6 address
translated: false
---

I'm trying to connect to a machine in Hetzner Cloud using IPv6. `ssh 2a01:4f8:c17:2000::/64` doesn't work, but `ssh root@2a01:4f8:c17:2000::1` does. 

The IPv6 address was copied from the Hetzner Cloud console.

The `~/.ssh/config` file can be configured to apply different proxy rules for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. This setup allows you to specify a proxy command for IPv4 addresses while handling IPv6 addresses differently. 

```bash
Host 192.168.1.*
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa 
Host *.*.*.*
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ProxyCommand corkscrew localhost 7890 %h %p
Host *
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa   
```
