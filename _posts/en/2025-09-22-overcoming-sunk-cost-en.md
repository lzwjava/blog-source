title: Overcoming Sunk Cost for Innovation
translated: false
type: note
---

Absolutely, let's dive deeper into this concept. I'll break it down step by step for clarity: starting with the psychological trap (sunk cost fallacy), how it blocks innovation, why ditching it feels hard but pays off in the long run, and real-world examples like Yin Wang's approach or switching platforms like Weibo/WordPress to Substack. This isn't just business jargon—it's a mindset shift that can unlock creativity and efficiency in personal projects, careers, or even hobbies.

### 1. **What is Sunk Cost Fallacy?**
At its core, the sunk cost fallacy is the irrational tendency to continue investing time, money, or effort into something *solely* because of what you've already put in, rather than evaluating its future potential. Psychologically, it's wired into us—humans hate waste and loss aversion (a concept from behavioral economics, popularized by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky). For example:
- You've spent $500 on a concert ticket, but you're feeling sick. Do you go anyway? Many do, just because they "don't want to waste the money."
- In tech or writing, it might mean sticking with a clunky tool (like an old coding IDE or a outdated blog platform) because you've "invested years mastering it," even if a better alternative exists.

The key flaw? Past costs are *irrevocable*—they're "sunk" and can't be recovered. Rational decision-making should only consider *future* costs and benefits. Ignoring sunk costs frees you to pivot without guilt, which is revolutionary for innovation.

### 2. **How Sunk Cost Fallacy Hinders Innovation**
Innovation thrives on experimentation, iteration, and bold leaps—not loyalty to the familiar. When you're burdened by sunk costs:
- **You Overcommit to Failing Paths**: Time wasted tweaking an inefficient system (e.g., a legacy software stack) instead of building something fresh. Companies like Nokia clung to old phone tech and missed the smartphone wave; Blockbuster ignored streaming for their video rental empire.
- **It Stifles Creativity**: Fear of "throwing away" effort makes you risk-averse. You might polish a mediocre blog post on an obsolete platform rather than starting a podcast or newsletter that could reach a global audience.
- **Opportunity Cost Mounts**: Every day you delay switching compounds the loss. What if that "old way" is eating 20% of your time? Redirecting that energy to a new tool could multiply your output 2x or 3x.

In short, sunk costs act like emotional anchors, keeping ships (your ideas or projects) from sailing into uncharted waters. Entrepreneurs like Elon Musk or Paul Graham (of Y Combinator) emphasize this: kill your darlings early if they're not serving the vision.

### 3. **Why Overcoming It is Hard—But Essential for Long-Term Wins**
Switching feels painful because:
- **Emotional Attachment**: We've anthropomorphized our investments (e.g., "I've built my brand on WordPress—how can I abandon it?").
- **Short-Term Disruptions**: Learning a new platform means a learning curve, data migration headaches, or temporary audience dips. Yin Wang, for instance, is a brilliant computer scientist and blogger (his site, yinwang.org, is a goldmine of essays on programming, AI, and life philosophy). He's migrated content across platforms over the years, but each move required effort to rebuild links, SEO, and reader habits.
- **Social Pressure**: Peers or followers might say, "Why fix what ain't broke?" But as Wang often argues in his writings (influenced by his Princeton and Google background), true progress comes from questioning assumptions and embracing simplicity over complexity.

The payoff? **Long-run benefits outweigh the pain**:
- **Efficiency Gains**: New tools often have smarter workflows. Substack's editor, for example, is more intuitive than WordPress's Gutenberg blocks, with built-in SEO, analytics, and mobile optimization—saving hours per post.
- **Better Distribution and Reach**: Weibo (China's microblogging giant) is great for quick shares but algorithmically siloed and censored; WordPress requires manual promotion. Substack excels at organic growth via newsletters, recommendations, and paid subscriptions—turning passive readers into a loyal community. Writers like Heather Cox Richardson or Bari Weiss exploded their influence post-switch.
- **Monetization and Feedback Loops**: Substack's model lets you earn directly from subscribers, fostering deeper engagement. This creates a virtuous cycle: better content → more readers → more motivation to innovate.
- **Resilience**: Diversifying reduces dependency. If Weibo cracks down (as it has on tech discussions), you're not sunk.

Economically, it's like compound interest in reverse: early sunk cost thinking erodes value; letting go accelerates growth. Studies (e.g., from Harvard Business Review) show innovators who pivot quickly outperform those who double down—think how Netflix killed DVDs for streaming.

### 4. **Yin Wang's Philosophy as a Case Study**
Yin Wang embodies this anti-sunk-cost ethos. His blog (https://www.yinwang.org) is a manifesto for clear, original thinking—often critiquing bloated systems in tech (like unnecessary abstractions in programming) and advocating for elegant, minimal solutions. He's not afraid to "throw out" established norms:
- **Innovation Through Rejection**: In essays like "The Myth of Software Engineering," he dismantles overhyped methodologies (e.g., agile rituals) that people cling to due to training investments. His advice? Prototype radically new ways, even if it means unlearning.
- **Platform Evolution**: Wang started on platforms like Google Sites or Sina Blog (similar to Weibo), then went independent. Why? Control, speed, and ad-free purity. No sunk cost to a corporate ecosystem—he switched for better long-term ownership of his intellectual property.
- **Personal Lesson**: Wang's career (from academia to indie writing after leaving big tech) shows that mid-career pivots, though disruptive, lead to fulfillment. He's said (paraphrasing his style) that innovation isn't incremental tweaks; it's rebuilding from first principles, ignoring "what's already there."

If you're inspired by him, his site's archive is worth a deep read—it's a masterclass in ditching the old for the profound.

### 5. **Practical Advice: How to Apply This in Your Life**
To care less about sunk costs and innovate freely:
- **Audit Ruthlessly**: Ask, "If I started today, would I choose this path?" For platforms: Export your Weibo/WordPress data (tools like RSS feeds or APIs make it easier than you think) and test Substack for a month.
- **Set a "Pivot Threshold"**: Define success metrics upfront (e.g., "If engagement doesn't hit X after 3 months, switch"). This removes emotion.
- **Start Small**: Experiment in parallel—run a Substack alongside WordPress to build momentum without full abandonment.
- **Mindset Tools**: Read "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Kahneman for the psychology, or "The Lean Startup" by Eric Ries for practical innovation frameworks. Journal your "sunk cost wins" to build confidence.
- **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**: Don't confuse sunk costs with *strategic investments* (e.g., a domain name you own is an asset, not a trap). Also, ensure the new way aligns with your goals—innovation for its own sake can backfire.

In the end, yes, for the good benefits in the long run, we *must* care less about sunk costs. It's liberating: imagine the energy freed up for truly novel ideas. What's a specific "old way" in your world (tech stack, habit, or project) that you're wrestling with? I'd love to brainstorm how to toss it.
