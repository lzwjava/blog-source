## Old Modem Issues

In my parent's house, the modem is quite old, likely around 10 years old. The initial network setup was:

modem -> 3m wireless -> TP-Link AX3000 (wireless bridge mode) -> 2m, a wall, wireless -> Laptop

This resulted in a low download speed, with a Speedtest result of only 10 Mbps.

An improved setup involved using a wired connection:

modem -> 2m cable -> TP-Link AX3000 (wired bridge mode) -> 4m wireless, a wall -> Laptop

This improved the download speed to up to 90 Mbps.

## New Modem Performance

In my own house, the modem is new, and the TP-Link router performs well in wireless bridge mode. The network setup is:

modem -> 4m wireless -> TP-Link AX3000 (wireless bridge mode) -> 2m wireless -> Laptop

The network quality is good.


## Troubleshooting Tips

There isn't a single solution to improve Wi-Fi speed. A good approach is to use a cable to test each part of your network to identify bottlenecks. Compare speeds when using a wired connection versus Wi-Fi. Also, try connecting devices directly with a cable to see if that improves performance.
