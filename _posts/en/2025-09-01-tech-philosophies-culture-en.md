This is a really interesting observation. Different companies adopt different **workplace infrastructure philosophies**, and the variations you noticed often come from a mix of **culture, size, regulation, and technology strategy**. Let’s break it down.

---

### 1. Companies Without Employee Emails

Some firms, especially in **China or smaller organizations**, skip corporate email entirely. Instead:

* They use **personal emails** only when strictly necessary (e.g., external vendor contact).
* Most internal workflows — timesheets, leave applications, HR policies — are handled on **internal web portals**.
* **WeChat Enterprise (企业微信)** is the main hub for communication, approvals, and announcements.

**Why they do this:**

* Lower IT overhead (no mail server, fewer compliance tasks).
* Culturally, messaging apps dominate over email in China.
* Stronger “ecosystem lock-in” — WeChat Enterprise can handle attendance, approvals, even payroll.

### 2. Companies with Employee Emails but Low Usage

Other firms provide an official **@company.com email**:

* It may be required for credibility with partners or international clients.
* But employees still **default to internal portals** or chat tools for most day-to-day tasks.
* Email becomes a **secondary tool**, used mainly for official documentation, vendor relations, or certain audits.

**Why they do this:**

* Balances external professionalism (email still has global legitimacy) with internal efficiency.
* Reduces reliance on personal email but doesn’t change the “chat-first” culture inside.

### 3. Companies on Feishu/Lark or Similar Platforms

Firms adopting **Feishu (飞书/Lark)**:

* Treat it as a **“super-app”**: messaging, video calls, OKRs, project management, approval workflows, and even lightweight email replacement.
* Unlike WeChat Enterprise, Feishu is positioned as a **work-focused platform**, more similar to Slack/Teams in the West.
* Some companies integrate Feishu with their HR/ERP systems to streamline work.

**Why they do this:**

* Modern, integrated workflow.
* Preferred by tech-savvy or multinational teams who want Slack-like flexibility but within a China-compliant ecosystem.
* Can reduce tool fragmentation.

### 4. How to See These Differences

The key is to view them as **different philosophies of organizational digital infrastructure**:

* **WeChat Enterprise model** = Chat-first, China-centric, pragmatic, cost-saving.
* **Internal systems + light email** = Hybrid, balancing global norms and local habits.
* **Feishu/Lark adoption** = Modern integrated platform, aiming for productivity gains and a “single workspace.”

Which one is “better” depends on the company’s **scale, international exposure, regulatory needs, and culture**. For example:

* A local trading firm may thrive entirely inside WeChat Enterprise.
* A multinational bank must rely on email for compliance and external credibility.
* A fast-growing startup may choose Feishu to unify workflows and reduce friction.

👉 Would you like me to map these approaches against **company size and industry type** (e.g., startups vs banks vs factories) so you can see which style fits which context best?
