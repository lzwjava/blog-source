### Translation and Summary of the Chinese Text

This appears to be a follow-up post or comment, starting with "no," (possibly rejecting a prior counterargument), and building on the previous conspiracy claim. It targets photography enthusiasts, proposing a "simple experiment" to "prove" space photos are faked. Here's a direct English translation:

> No,  
> 
> I want to add something that photography enthusiasts can understand, hoping to draw the attention of people who've learned a bit of photography knowledge.  
> 
> Regarding the lack of stars in space photos, many official explanations say "the sun is too bright, so stars can't be captured." But if you truly understand camera principles, you'll realize that bright light in the scene only triggers automatic exposure adjustment (if using "auto mode"). Ultimately, it's the camera's exposure that determines the photo, not the presence of nearby bright objects.  
> 
> So my experiment uses manual exposure adjustment, completely avoiding interference from the "external light source" condition. This experiment reveals the fact: If exposure is set low enough to exclude stars, it also fails to capture dark-part details on other objects. This is because stars are brighter than the dark areas of ordinary objects.  
> 
> With such low exposure, the result is basically black paper—not a usable photo. This doesn't match "space photos," which show dark-part details and object depth/3D sense, yet the black sky has zero stars. This is a contradiction, violating camera exposure rules.  
> 
> This experiment is so simple—anyone can do it—and it uncovers the world's biggest secret. I hope everyone takes it seriously; I think it rivals Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment in importance, equivalent to Copernicus overthrowing the geocentric model. It threatens the existence of the Matrix religious theocracy.

The author claims a hands-on test (manually underexposing to hide stars) proves space images impossible: visible shadows/details should force stars to appear, but they don't in official photos. They frame this as a paradigm-shifting revelation akin to historical scientific revolutions, implying a vast cover-up (e.g., "Matrix" as a metaphor for simulated reality or elite control).

### Factual Explanation: Debunking the Photography "Experiment"

This argument misunderstands key concepts in photography, especially **dynamic range**, **point sources vs. extended sources**, and how cameras handle contrast in high-dynamic-range scenes like space. It's a common misconception in conspiracy discussions, but it falls apart under scrutiny. Let's break it down step-by-step, with a simple experiment *you* can try to see why.

#### 1. **Camera Exposure Isn't the Whole Story—It's About Dynamic Range and Light Intensity**
   - Exposure (shutter speed, aperture, ISO) controls *total light intake*, but it doesn't "decide" visibility in isolation. In a scene with huge brightness differences (e.g., bright ISS panels + faint stars), the camera's sensor has a **limited dynamic range** (ability to capture both bright and dark details without clipping or noise).
     - Bright areas (sunlit Earth/ISS) can be 10,000–1,000,000 times brighter than stars.
     - To avoid overexposing the bright parts (turning them white blobs), you set a short exposure. This works for the foreground but starves the faint sky.
   - The claim "bright objects don't affect exposure" is half-right for *manual mode*—you control it—but ignores that manual settings are *chosen* based on the scene's brightest elements to prevent blowout. Auto mode meters off the dominant light (e.g., the Sun/Earth), but pros (like NASA photographers) use manual or histograms for precision.
   - Crucially: **Stars aren't "brighter than shadows."** 
     - A star's light is concentrated in a tiny **point source** (one pixel or less), making it faint overall (e.g., magnitude 1–6 stars deliver ~10^-6 lux to the sensor).
     - Shadows on a sunlit object (e.g., ISS struts) are **extended sources**—diffuse reflected sunlight over many pixels (e.g., 0.01–1 lux). Even dim shadows outshine stars *per area* because they're closer and larger.
     - Result: Exposure for shadows captures their bulk light, but stars remain too dim for that setting.

#### 2. **The Proposed Experiment Is Flawed—Here's Why and How to Test It Properly**
   - Their test (manually underexpose to hide stars, expect shadows to vanish too) assumes stars and shadows have similar brightness, which they don't. It also ignores **post-processing** (HDR blending, common in space imagery) and **lens flare/contrast**.
   - **Real Experiment You Can Do (5 Minutes, Any DSLR/Smartphone):**
     1. Go outside at dusk: Shoot a foreground object (e.g., a tree or car) lit by streetlights (mimics "bright Earth/ISS") against a starry sky.
     2. **Manual mode**: Set ISO 100, aperture f/8, shutter 1/100s (exposes for the lit object—shadows visible, details sharp).
        - Result: Tree/car shows 3D depth/shadows; stars invisible (overpowered by foreground light scatter).
     3. Now crank shutter to 30s (for stars): Tree/car overexposes to white; stars streak in.
     4. **Fix it like NASA**: Take two shots, blend in software (e.g., Photoshop/Lightroom HDR). Boom—composite with lit foreground + starry sky.
     - This matches ISS photos: Raw exposures prioritize the mission (clear structure/Earth views), stars added in composites or separate long-exposure shots.
   - Why their test fails: Underexposing *everything* to "star level" blacks out the whole scene because the foreground needs *way more light*. Space photos aren't underexposed globally—they're optimized for the bright subject, with the black sky as a byproduct.

#### 3. **Evidence from Actual Space Photography**
   - ISS cameras (e.g., Nikons modified for space) use the same rules. NASA/ESA routinely share **long-exposure star shots** from the ISS, proving stars *are* capturable—just not in the same frame as bright objects without tricks.
     - Example: During "orbital night," exposures capture star trails over Earth cities—no "black paper," full details.
   - Pro photographers confirm: Astrophotography requires separate exposures for sky/ground. The "contradiction" vanishes when you account for this.
   - No "Matrix theocracy" needed—it's just optics and engineering, verified by amateurs worldwide (e.g., tracking ISS passes and snapping their own photos).

This isn't a Galileo-level secret; it's a teachable moment on why science imagery prioritizes clarity over "wow" effects. If space were faked, why release editable RAW files or let amateurs verify orbits? Try the experiment above—it'll show the real "secret": Reality is weirder (and cooler) than conspiracies.
