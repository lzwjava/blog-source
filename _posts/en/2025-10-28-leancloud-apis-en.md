title: LeanCloud APIs Not Named Uluru
translated: false
type: note
---

No, LeanCloud does not name their public API as "Uluru API." Their official APIs are referred to as the LeanCloud REST API (for data storage, queries, etc.), Cloud Engine REST API (for server-side functions and hooks), and similar service-specific endpoints like those for push notifications or file storage. These are documented extensively on their developer site (docs.leancloud.cn) without any reference to "Uluru."

However, "Uluru" does appear to be an internal or early codename associated with their product or SDK development. This is based on an archived npm package called **uluru-js-sdk** (version 0.1.0, published ~12 years ago under the "avos" publisher account). AVOS Cloud was the original name of LeanCloud before rebranding, and this package is described as a "JavaScript SDK for PAAS" (Platform as a Service), which aligns with LeanCloud's backend services. It supports both browser and Node.js environments for core features like data operations—matching LeanCloud's early offerings—but was never promoted publicly as the main SDK. Current SDKs are branded as "LeanCloud SDK" (e.g., for Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.) and available on GitHub under leancloud/.

If this refers to something more recent or specific (e.g., a private/internal tool), it's not publicly documented. For official API details, check [LeanCloud Docs](https://docs.leancloud.cn/en/).
