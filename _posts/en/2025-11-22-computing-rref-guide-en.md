I understand the frustration! Computing reduced row echelon form (RREF) can feel chaotic if you're just making random moves. Here's a systematic approach that's much more reliable:

**The key is to work column by column, left to right, and follow these steps for each column:**

1. **Find your pivot** – Look down the current column for a non-zero entry (below any pivots you've already created). This becomes your pivot.

2. **Move the pivot to the right row** – Swap rows to get that pivot into the correct position (the next row that needs a leading entry).

3. **Scale the pivot row** – Multiply the entire pivot row by a constant so the pivot becomes 1.

4. **Eliminate above and below** – Subtract appropriate multiples of the pivot row from all other rows to make every other entry in that pivot column equal to 0.

5. **Move right** – Once a column is done, move to the next column and repeat.

**Why this works better than random operations:** You're building the RREF systematically from top-left to bottom-right. Each column you finish stays finished because you eliminate both above and below the pivot.

**A concrete example:** If your matrix has a pivot in position (1,1), you eliminate everything else in column 1. Then move to column 2, create a pivot there, and eliminate everything else in column 2 (including the row above it, which you wouldn't do in row echelon form). This is what makes it "reduced."

The random swapping and subtracting you're doing might create more zeros, but you can accidentally mess up work you've already done. Following this column-by-column system keeps you from backtracking.
