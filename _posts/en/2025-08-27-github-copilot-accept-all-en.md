title: GitHub Copilot Lacks Accept All Option

Got it. You're using **GitHub Copilot in VS Code**, and you're asking if there's a way to **accept all edits/suggestions at once**, similar to `Accept All Changes` in an editor like Word.

### Key Point
GitHub Copilot generates suggestions inline as **ghost text**. These suggestions are *not actual edits* until you explicitly accept them. Because of this design, there is **no "accept all" button** — you can only accept suggestions one at a time.

### Options You Have
1. **Accept a suggestion:**  
   - Press `Tab` or `Ctrl`+`Enter` (depending on your keybinding) when the ghost text appears.
   - This applies the suggestion into the buffer.

2. **Accept word-by-word or line-by-line:**  
   - `Tab` → Accept the entire suggestion.  
   - `Ctrl` + `→` (Windows/Linux) or `Option` + `→` (macOS) can accept parts of the suggestion step by step, if supported.

3. **If Copilot Chat (or Copilot Edits) is used:**  
   - In Copilot Chat, when code edits are proposed (like a diff in the inline editor), you **can accept/reject the whole file** or each chunk separately.  
   - Currently, you must go chunk by chunk. There’s no "apply all chunks" option.

✅ **Answer:** In the GitHub Copilot VS Code extension itself, there is **no command to "accept all edits" automatically**. You need to accept suggestions one by one (ghost text) or chunk by chunk (if using Copilot Chat with code edits).

👉 Do you want me to show you a hotkey/command palette trick so you can accept longer Copilot suggestions faster (like applying the whole block with one key press), or are you specifically after "apply all diffs in a file" (which is only available for Copilot Edits in preview)?
