The profitability of the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), one of China's "Big Four" state-owned commercial banks, stems from a combination of factors, including its significant role in mortgage lending and interest earnings, but also broader operational and market dynamics. Below, I outline the key reasons for ABC's profitability, with a focus on mortgage interest earnings and other contributing factors:

### 1. **Mortgage Lending and Interest Earnings**
   - **Significant Mortgage Portfolio**: ABC has a substantial exposure to the property sector, with a large portion of its loan portfolio tied to mortgages. As of 2022, Chinese banks collectively had about 62 trillion yuan ($9.2 trillion) in property sector exposure, with more than half in mortgage loans. ABC, as a major player, benefits significantly from interest income generated by these loans.[](https://x.com/Ajay_Bagga/status/1547783772669902848)
   - **Net Interest Margin (NIM)**: The difference between the interest earned on loans (like mortgages) and the interest paid on deposits is a key driver of profitability. For ABC, the net interest margin was reported at 1.42% at the end of 2024, though it faced pressure from economic slowdowns and property sector challenges. Despite this, mortgage loans, which often carry higher interest rates than other loan types, contribute significantly to ABC’s interest income.[](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-agbank-2024-profit-rises-47-2025-03-28/)
   - **Stable Demand for Housing**: While China’s property sector has faced challenges (e.g., a downturn exemplified by missed bond payments by developers like Country Garden), government policies encouraging home ownership and urban development have historically driven mortgage demand, boosting ABC’s lending activities.[](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/agricultural-bank-china-issues-profitability-093000930.html)

### 2. **Large Asset Base and Scale**
   - **Massive Asset Size**: ABC is one of the largest banks globally, with total assets of approximately 38.03 trillion yuan (US$5.22 trillion) as of mid-2023. This scale allows ABC to leverage economies of scale, spreading operational costs across a vast customer base and loan portfolio.[](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/agricultural-bank-china-issues-profitability-093000930.html)
   - **Diversified Revenue Streams**: Beyond mortgages, ABC generates revenue through corporate banking, personal banking, treasury operations, and agro-related financial services. Its focus on inclusive finance, such as small and micro-enterprise loans (592.3 billion yuan in 2019), further bolsters profitability.[](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/9/8/150)

### 3. **State Ownership and Policy Support**
   - **Government Backing**: As a state-owned bank, ABC benefits from strong government support, including favorable policies and potential recapitalization (e.g., a pledged 500 billion yuan to strengthen major banks’ capital in 2024). This reduces financial risks and enhances stability, allowing ABC to maintain profitability even in challenging economic conditions.[](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-agbank-2024-profit-rises-47-2025-03-28/)
   - **Policy-Driven Lending**: ABC aligns with national priorities, such as supporting agriculture, rural development, and small businesses. For instance, its inclusive loan balance for small and micro-enterprises reached 592.3 billion yuan by 2019, with an average interest rate of 4.66%, contributing to stable revenue.[](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/9/8/150)

### 4. **Credit Quality and Risk Management**
   - **Low Non-Performing Loan (NPL) Ratio**: ABC has maintained relatively strong credit quality, with its NPL ratio dropping to 1.35% by mid-2023 from 1.37% the previous year. Effective risk management reduces losses from bad loans, preserving profitability.[](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/agricultural-bank-china-issues-profitability-093000930.html)
   - **Focus on Low-Risk Assets**: ABC’s emphasis on prudent management and balanced loan portfolios (e.g., supporting low-risk, policy-aligned sectors like agriculture) helps mitigate risks associated with volatile sectors like real estate.[](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-04144-5)

### 5. **Market Position and Operational Efficiency**
   - **Extensive Network**: ABC operates a vast network of branches, including over 40,000 outlets, serving 622 million clients. This extensive reach enhances its ability to attract deposits at lower costs and distribute loans efficiently, boosting profitability.[](https://gfmag.com/features/stars-china-2021/)
   - **Innovation in Services**: ABC has innovated in payment systems (e.g., the “K-code” payment system for online transactions) and tailored financial products for rural and small-business clients, which have driven customer growth and revenue.[](https://gfmag.com/features/stars-china-2021/)

### 6. **Macroeconomic and Regulatory Environment**
   - **Interest Rate Dynamics**: While interest rate liberalization has pressured net interest margins across Chinese banks, ABC benefits from China’s controlled monetary policy, which stabilizes lending and deposit rates. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) sets benchmark rates, like the 5-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) at 3.6% in January 2025, which influences mortgage rates.[](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/20/china-keeps-benchmark-lending-rates-unchanged-as-it-contends-with-a-weakening-yuan.html)
   - **Economic Scale**: China’s large economy and banking sector, where state-owned banks control significant market share, provide a stable foundation for profitability. ABC’s ability to maintain profitability despite a slowing economy and property sector issues highlights its resilience.[](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-agbank-2024-profit-rises-47-2025-03-28/)

### Challenges to Profitability
Despite these strengths, ABC faces challenges that could impact future profitability:
   - **Shrinking Net Interest Margins**: Regulatory pressure to lower lending rates and support the economy (e.g., mortgage rate cuts) has compressed margins.[](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-bocom-posts-12-rise-q3-profit-2024-10-30/)[](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/agricultural-bank-china-issues-profitability-093000930.html)
   - **Property Sector Risks**: The ongoing property crisis, with developers facing bad debts, poses risks to ABC’s mortgage and real estate-related loan portfolios.[](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-agbank-2024-profit-rises-47-2025-03-28/)
   - **Economic Slowdown**: A sluggish post-COVID recovery and deflationary pressures reduce loan demand, impacting interest income.[](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-bocom-posts-12-rise-q3-profit-2024-10-30/)

### Conclusion
ABC’s profitability is driven by its large-scale mortgage lending and interest earnings, bolstered by a massive asset base, government support, and a strong market position. While mortgage interest earnings are a significant contributor, ABC’s diversified revenue streams, effective risk management, and alignment with national policies further enhance its financial performance. However, ongoing economic challenges and margin pressures require careful management to sustain profitability.

To estimate the number of mortgage customers the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) has, assuming each customer’s mortgage loan is 1 million yuan, we need to determine ABC’s total mortgage loan amount and divide it by the assumed loan amount per customer.

### Step 1: Total Mortgage Loan Amount
The search results provide some context but lack a precise figure for ABC’s total mortgage loan amount in 2024. However, we can use available data to make an informed estimate:
- **Web Result** states that China’s total mortgage loans across all banks were 38.6 trillion yuan ($5.29 trillion) by the end of June 2023, representing 17% of banks’ total loan books.[](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/chinas-agbank-posts-348-rise-first-half-profit-2023-08-29/)
- ABC is one of the "Big Four" state-owned banks, alongside Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank (CC भी), and Bank of China (BOC). These banks collectively dominate the mortgage market, but specific breakdowns for ABC’s mortgage portfolio are not provided in the results.
- For context, **Web Result** notes that large state-owned banks (including ABC) lent out 116 trillion yuan in total loans by the end of 2023. If mortgages constitute 17% of this (as per), the mortgage loans for these banks would be approximately 19.72 trillion yuan (116 trillion × 0.17). Assuming ABC holds a proportional share (e.g., roughly one-fourth, given the four major banks), ABC’s mortgage loans could be estimated at around 4.93 trillion yuan (19.72 trillion ÷ 4). This is a rough estimate, as market shares vary.[](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1171235/china-total-loans-from-large-state-owned-banks/)[](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/chinas-agbank-posts-348-rise-first-half-profit-2023-08-29/)

Since no exact figure for ABC’s 2024 mortgage loans is available, let’s use 4.93 trillion yuan as a reasonable estimate based on the proportional share.

### Step 2: Calculate Number of Mortgage Customers
- **Assumed loan amount per customer**: 1 million yuan (1,000,000 yuan).
- **Estimated total mortgage loans for ABC**: 4.93 trillion yuan = 4,930,000,000,000 yuan.
- **Number of mortgage customers** = Total mortgage loans ÷ Loan amount per customer
  \\[
  \frac{4,930,000,000,000}{1,000,000} = 4,930,000
  \\]

### Step 3: Considerations and Caveats
- **Average Loan Size**: The assumption of 1 million yuan per mortgage is a simplification. Actual mortgage sizes vary widely depending on location (e.g., urban vs. rural areas), property type, and economic conditions. For instance, mortgages in major cities like Beijing or Shanghai are often much higher, while those in rural areas may be lower.
- **Market Share**: The estimate assumes ABC has an equal share among the Big Four banks, but ICBC, as the largest, may have a larger mortgage portfolio. If ABC’s share is smaller (e.g., 20% instead of 25%), the mortgage loan amount could be closer to 3.94 trillion yuan, reducing the number of customers to approximately 3.94 million.
- **Data Limitations**: Without precise 2024 data for ABC’s mortgage portfolio, this is an educated estimate. Annual reports or official statements from ABC would provide a more accurate figure.

### Final Answer
Assuming each mortgage loan is 1 million yuan and estimating ABC’s mortgage portfolio at approximately 4.93 trillion yuan, ABC likely has around **4.93 million mortgage customers**. This figure is an estimate and could vary based on actual loan sizes and ABC’s market share.
