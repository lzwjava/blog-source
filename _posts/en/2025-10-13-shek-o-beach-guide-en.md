Shek O Beach is a popular, family-friendly public beach on the southeastern tip of Hong Kong Island in the Southern District. It's renowned for its long stretch of soft white sand, clear shallow waters with good quality (consistently rated "Good" for swimming), and gentle waves, making it ideal for relaxation, swimming, sunbathing, and barbecues. Nestled between lush green hills and facing Island Bay, it offers a laid-back vibe that's favored by locals, expat families (especially French communities), and weekend crowds seeking an escape from the city bustle.

## How to Get There from Mong Kok

The easiest and most affordable way is by public transport (MTR and bus), taking about 40-50 minutes and costing around HK$15-25 total (use an Octopus card for seamless payment). Here's the step-by-step:

1. From Mong Kok MTR Station, take the Tsuen Wan Line (red line) southbound towards Admiralty/Central (3 stops, ~5 minutes).
2. At Admiralty, transfer to the Island Line (blue line) eastbound towards Chai Wan.
3. Ride the Island Line to Shau Kei Wan Station (about 15-20 minutes from Admiralty).
4. Exit Shau Kei Wan Station and walk to the nearby bus stop for NWFB Bus No. 9 (direction: Shek O).
5. Take Bus 9 for about 10-15 minutes and get off at the Shek O Beach stop—it's right by the entrance.

Buses run frequently (every 10-15 minutes), but check the Citybus/NWFB app or website for real-time schedules, especially on weekends when it gets busier. Taxis are an option (~HK$200-250, 30-40 minutes) if you prefer direct travel, but public transport is efficient and eco-friendly.
