* The reason people worsen their eyesight is that they use glasses with full prescription (which lets them see a blackboard clearly at 5m) to look at phones, computers, or books most of the time. This causes their eyeballs to deform.

* After using glasses with a 150-200 degree reduction for several days, you won't want to go back to full prescription glasses. The latter becomes very uncomfortable.

* Understanding myopia is key - it's caused by eye muscle changes, not just genetics or light exposure.

* The most important principle is "just barely clear" - wear glasses that make things just clear enough without straining.

* For computer or phone use, a 150-200 degree reduction often works well.

* Keep a stronger prescription pair for driving and essential tasks requiring perfect vision.

* Expect slow progress - about 25 degrees reduction every three months is good.

* Don't aim for perfect clarity. Slightly blurry vision is part of the improvement process.

* Use the formula: Myopia degree = 100/clear distance (in meters) for rough assessment.

* Don't force yourself to see clearly - let your eyes adjust naturally.

* Learn about your eye mechanics - understanding how external eye muscles work helps make better vision choices.

* Myopia requires wearing glasses, which can be troublesome during activities like playing basketball or when wearing a hat. The hat cannot stretch to cover more skin and provide warmth because the glasses take up space. Forgetting to wear glasses also affects vision.

* While some people may feel too old or lazy to address their myopia, it's crucial to take action for the sake of future generations to prevent the same challenges.

* The improvement process takes time - myopia developed over years will take time to improve.

* The point is that most of the time, our eyes can clearly see the objects we want to view. If we move objects about 10 cm farther away, they become unclear. This indicates that we are using our eyes correctly.

* Since we use phones or computers most of the time, we need to reduce the prescription strength of our eyeglasses to use our eyes correctly.

* Consider the case of presbyopia lenses. As people age, their eye muscles change shape in a direction opposite to that in myopia. We can apply the principles used in presbyopia lenses to myopia lenses.

* I recommend multifocal progressive lenses. Based on your prescription, assuming correct vision is 0.9, the suggestion is to make the additional correction for near vision +1.75 D in myopia (with astigmatism remaining unchanged), while the additional correction for far vision is +1.00 D in myopia (with astigmatism remaining unchanged).
