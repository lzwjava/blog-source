title: Downloading OpenWebText Subset via Hugging Face
translated: false
type: note
---

The dataset you're referring to is hosted on Hugging Face under the repo ID `Skylion007/openwebtext`. The specific file `subsets/urlsf_subset00.tar` is publicly accessible (no auth required), so you can download it using the Hugging Face CLI tool (`huggingface-cli`). Here's how:

### Prerequisites
- Install the Hugging Face Hub CLI if you haven't already:
  ```
  pip install huggingface_hub
  ```
- (Optional) If you have the `huggingface-cli` command aliased as `hf` (common on some systems), you can use that shorthand. Otherwise, use the full `huggingface-cli` prefix.

### Download Command
Run this in your terminal:
```
huggingface-cli download Skylion007/openwebtext subsets/urlsf_subset00.tar --local-dir ./openwebtext
```
- This will download the file to `./openwebtext/subsets/urlsf_subset00.tar` (creating the `subsets` subdir if needed).
- The file is quite large (~1.5 GB uncompressed, but it's a tarball), so ensure you have enough disk space and a stable connection.
- If you want to download it without the repo structure (directly to the current dir), add `--repo-type dataset` (though it's implied here) or adjust `--local-dir`.

### Using Python (Alternative)
If you prefer scripting it in Python (e.g., via the `huggingface_hub` library):
```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

# Download to current directory
hf_hub_download(
    repo_id="Skylion007/openwebtext",
    filename="subsets/urlsf_subset00.tar",
    local_dir="./openwebtext",  # Optional: specifies base dir
    repo_type="dataset"
)
```
Install the lib first: `pip install huggingface_hub`.

### Notes
- This is a subset of OpenWebText (a large web corpus). After downloading, you'll need to extract the `.tar` file (e.g., `tar -xvf subsets/urlsf_subset00.tar`).
- If the download fails (e.g., due to network issues), retry or use `--cache-dir` to specify a custom cache location.
- For the full dataset or other subsets, check the repo page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Skylion007/openwebtext.

If you run into errors, share the output for debugging!
