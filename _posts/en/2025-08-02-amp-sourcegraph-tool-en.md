Sourcegraph's Amp is an agentic coding tool designed to maximize the capabilities of advanced AI models for developers. Here’s what makes it special:

- **Unconstrained Token Usage**: Unlike other AI coding tools that limit token usage, Amp uses the best models (like Claude Sonnet 4) without restrictions, enabling high-quality code generation and complex task execution. This makes it cost-effective for serious development work.[](https://ampcode.com/manual)[](https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/secure-code-with-amp-by-sourcegraph/)

- **Seamless Integration**: Amp operates as a VS Code extension (compatible with forks like Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium) and a CLI tool, fitting into existing workflows without requiring a new UI. It supports proxy servers and custom certificates for corporate environments.[](https://ampcode.com/manual)[](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40sourcegraph/amp)

- **Multiplayer Collaboration**: Amp allows thread sharing and leaderboards, enabling teams to collaborate, reuse successful workflows, and track adoption. This fosters teamwork and improves productivity.[](https://sourcegraph.com/amp)[](https://ampcode.com/manual)

- **Context Management**: Amp intelligently selects relevant code snippets for context, avoiding bloated token usage while ensuring the AI has enough information to generate accurate code. This is a key differentiator from tools like Sourcegraph’s older product, Cody, which pulled entire codebases.[](https://zoltanbourne.substack.com/p/early-preview-of-amp-the-new-ai-coding)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1kpin6e/tried_amp_sourcegraphs_new_ai_coding_agent_heres/)

- **Security Features**: Amp includes command allowlisting to control which CLI commands the AI can run, stored in project settings, and automatic secret redaction to prevent sensitive data exposure. It also supports zero-retention policies for enterprise users.[](https://zoltanbourne.substack.com/p/early-preview-of-amp-the-new-ai-coding)[](https://ampcode.com/security)

- **Powerful Automation**: Amp handles autonomous reasoning, comprehensive code editing, and complex tasks, reportedly writing 70-80% of code for some users. Features like the “To-Do’s” update provide live progress tracking, enhancing the user experience.[](https://ainativedev.io/news/sourcegraphs-amp-dropped)[](https://medium.com/%40jonathanaraney/1-month-with-amp-vs-1-year-with-cursor-15572fca36ee)

- **Enterprise Focus**: Amp Enterprise offers single sign-on, volume discounts, and invoice payments for large purchases, making it suitable for organizations. It’s designed to scale with AI-accelerated development while integrating with security tools like StackHawk for vulnerability testing.[](https://sourcegraph.com/pricing)[](https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/secure-code-with-amp-by-sourcegraph/)

- **Community Praise**: Developers highlight Amp’s speed, accuracy, and ability to complete tasks effectively, often outperforming competitors like Cursor or Claude Code. Users appreciate its focus on quality results and thoughtful UX, like the “To-Do’s” feature.[](https://sourcegraph.com/amp)[](https://ampcode.com/)

However, some users note its credit-based pricing can be expensive, with costs tied to LLM usage and additional tools like web search. For example, one user reported spending $4 on 2,000 lines of code.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ll0kow/sourcegraph_cody_discontinued_replaced_by_cody/)

Amp is available at ampcode.com with $10 in free credits upon signup (plus $30 extra for Enterprise Starter users).
