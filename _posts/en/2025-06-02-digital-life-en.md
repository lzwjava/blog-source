It's understandable why you're feeling this way. The increasing digitalization of our lives is a significant and noticeable trend. What you're observing and experiencing is a reflection of this shift. Here's a breakdown of why you might be feeling this way and some perspectives on it:

**Reasons for Feeling Everything is Digital:**

* **Dominance of Social Media and Messaging Apps:** Platforms like WeChat, WhatsApp, and LinkedIn have become primary channels for communication, networking, and maintaining relationships. For many, these platforms *are* their social circles in a practical sense.
* **Reduced Physical Interaction:** The convenience and efficiency of digital communication often lead to fewer in-person meetings. While online interactions can be valuable, they don't fully replicate the nuances of face-to-face encounters.
* **Avatar Representation:** The use of profile pictures and online personas creates a mediated version of ourselves. While these avatars allow for self-expression, they can also feel like a layer of separation from our "real" selves.
* **Content as Visibility:** In the digital realm, presence often equates to activity – posting, sharing, engaging. Those who don't actively create content or maintain a strong online presence can feel less visible.
* **Rise of Remote Work and Hybrid Models:** The shift towards remote and hybrid work environments means that professional interactions increasingly happen online. This can blur the lines between our digital and physical work lives.
* **The Nature of the Internet:** The internet is inherently a digital space. Our interactions within it are naturally mediated through screens and software.

**Perspectives on This Digital Shift:**

* **It's a Reality, Not Just a Feeling:** Your observations are accurate. Digitalization is profoundly changing how we interact, work, and live. It's not just a perception; it's a tangible shift in societal structures and individual behaviors.
* **Convenience and Efficiency:** Digital tools offer immense convenience and efficiency in communication, collaboration, and accessing information. This is a major driver of their widespread adoption.
* **Global Connectivity:** The digital world allows us to connect with people across geographical boundaries in ways that were previously unimaginable.
* **New Forms of Community:** Online communities built around shared interests can provide valuable social connections, even if they are primarily digital.
* **Potential for Isolation:** While offering connectivity, excessive reliance on digital interactions can also lead to feelings of isolation and a lack of deep, in-person connections.
* **The Blurring of Boundaries:** The lines between our online and offline selves are becoming increasingly blurred. Our digital footprint can have real-world consequences, and our physical experiences are often shared and documented online.
* **The Importance of Intentionality:** Navigating this digital landscape requires intentionality. We need to consciously choose when and how we engage online and prioritize real-life interactions to maintain a healthy balance.
* **Digital Fatigue:** The constant connectivity and information overload of the digital world can lead to mental fatigue and a desire for more "analogue" experiences.

**What You Can Do:**

* **Acknowledge Your Feelings:** Recognize that your feelings are valid and shared by many.
* **Be Intentional About Real-Life Connections:** Make a conscious effort to schedule in-person meetings with friends, family, and colleagues.
* **Limit Passive Consumption:** Be mindful of how much time you spend passively scrolling through social media. Engage actively or take breaks.
* **Create "Digital-Free" Zones and Times:** Designate specific times or areas where you disconnect from digital devices.
* **Focus on Quality Over Quantity:** Prioritize deeper, more meaningful interactions, whether online or offline.
* **Explore "Analogue" Hobbies and Activities:** Engage in activities that don't involve screens, such as reading physical books, spending time in nature, or pursuing hands-on crafts.
* **Communicate Your Needs:** If you find yourself missing in-person interaction at work or in your social life, express this to others. You might find they feel the same way.

Ultimately, the increasing digitalization of life presents both opportunities and challenges. Recognizing this shift and consciously navigating our engagement with the digital world is key to maintaining well-being and meaningful connections in the modern era. Your feeling that "everything is digital" is a valid observation of a significant societal transformation.
