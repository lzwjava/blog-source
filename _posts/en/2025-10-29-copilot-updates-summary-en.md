### GitHub Copilot Extension for VS Code (Version 1.388.0)

Version 1.388.0 of the GitHub Copilot extension was released on October 24, 2025. This appears to be a minor update focused on stability and compatibility improvements, particularly with the latest VS Code release (1.105). Specific release notes are not publicly detailed in the marketplace or GitHub blog, but user reports indicate fixes for issues like unwanted code insertions during inline generation and extra tag completions when aborting suggestions. It integrates seamlessly with recent Copilot features, including enhanced agent modes and model selections.

#### Key Updates in the Last 6 Months (May–October 2025)
GitHub Copilot's major enhancements are typically announced alongside monthly VS Code releases. Here's a summary of significant updates for the extension and related features during this period:

- **October 2025 (VS Code 1.105 / Extension ~1.388)**: 
  - OpenAI Codex integration now available in VS Code Insiders for Copilot Pro+ subscribers, enabling advanced code synthesis directly in the editor.
  - New "mission control" interface for assigning, steering, and tracking Copilot coding agent tasks across sessions.
  - Agent Sessions view expanded to support the GitHub Copilot CLI for managing local and cloud-based agents.

- **September 2025 (VS Code 1.104 / Extension ~1.38x)**:
  - Rollout of the experimental GitHub Copilot-SWE model to VS Code Insiders, optimized for code editing, refactoring, and small transformations. It's task-focused and works in any Chat mode; detailed prompts recommended for best results.
  - Improved inline chat for terminal errors, with better explanations and fixes.

- **August 2025 (VS Code 1.103 / Extension ~1.37x)**:
  - Enhanced commit message suggestions with multi-line context awareness and integration with @workspace for generating entire project structures.
  - Lightweight inline chat upgrades for quicker interactions without opening full views.

- **July 2025 (VS Code 1.102 / Extension ~1.36x)**:
  - Better multi-file edit coordination via single prompts, analyzing project structure for consistent changes.
  - Deprecated older models (select Claude, OpenAI, and Gemini variants) in favor of newer, faster options like GPT-4.1.

- **June 2025 (VS Code 1.101 / Extension ~1.35x)**:
  - Introduction of prompt and instructions files for customizing Copilot's behavior with reusable guidelines and organizational knowledge.
  - Expanded GitHub Pull Requests integration: Assign PRs/issues to Copilot directly from VS Code views, with new "Copilot on My Behalf" query for tracking.

- **May 2025 (VS Code 1.100 / Extension ~1.34x)**:
  - Model Context Protocol (MCP) support added to agent mode, allowing custom API keys for third-party models.
  - Faster agent edits powered by OpenAI GPT-4.1 and Anthropic Claude Sonnet, especially for large files.
  - Repository search improvements for semantic code discovery and codebase-wide suggestions.

These updates emphasize agentic workflows, model performance, and seamless integration with VS Code's ecosystem. For the full extension history, check the VS Code Marketplace. Major announcements often tie into VS Code's monthly cycles.
