Popular terminal emulators for macOS besides iTerm2 and Ghostty include several open-source and proprietary options that cater to different needs, such as performance, features, and customization. These are based on recent recommendations and rankings, focusing on macOS-compatible applications.

### Popular Alternatives
- **Alacritty**: A fast, GPU-accelerated terminal with customizable theming and Vim-like editing. It's lightweight and highly performant for coding without bells and whistles. [1] [1][2]
- **Kitty**: Known for GPU acceleration and modern features like tabs, splits, and desktop notifications. It supports extensions and is great for power users needing efficiency in large-scale workflows. [1] [2][3][4]
- **WezTerm**: Cross-platform with advanced features like serial multiplexing, graphical selection, and scripting in Lua. Ideal for detailed configuration and efficient multitasking. [1][5]
- **Warp**: A modern terminal with AI collaboration features, like "Warptime" for sharing sessions, and built-in completions. It's user-friendly for teams but has a learning curve due to its unique UI. [1] [3][4][5]
- **Hyper**: Built on web technologies, offering extensibility via plugins and themes. Suited for developers who want to customize via CSS and JavaScript, though it can be resource-intensive. [4][5]
- **Tabby**: Versatile with SSH/Telnet support, multi-language theming, and split views. Good for remote work or basic daily use, with options for encrypted credentials. [6] (Reddit discussion highlights Tabby as an alternative with potential bugs, but still considered.)
- **CoreShell**: Focused on SSH and SFTP, with features like smart authentication and session management. Best for secure remote connections rather than local terminal tasks. [3] [4]
- **Commander One**: A file manager with an integrated terminal, useful for dual-pane browsing and quick commands. More GUI-oriented for file operations alongside terminal use. [5]

These options are free or have free versions, with varying degrees of community support. The native macOS Terminal app is always available as a baseline, but for advanced users, Ghostty and iTerm2 remain top choices for comparison. If you're looking for specific features like AI integration or GPU speed, Warp or Alacritty might suit best. For customizations, check each project's GitHub for macOS compatibility. [3] (updated 2025 guide) ஂTo install most of these, use Homebrew (e.g., `brew install --cask kitty`) or download from official sites. Start with one that matches your workflow Archetype, as switching terminals involves reconfiguring settings. For the latest versions, refer to each app's release notes, as features evolve quickly.\\mீewódz
