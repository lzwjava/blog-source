That's a great question! Tomas Mikolov, a Czech computer scientist, is indeed a prominent figure in machine learning, particularly known for his work on word embeddings like Word2Vec. To give you a broader picture, here are some other notable European scholars and scientists who have made significant contributions to computer science, machine learning, and software:

**In Computer Science:**

* **Sir Tim Berners-Lee (United Kingdom):** Often called the "father of the World Wide Web," his invention of the WWW, along with key technologies like HTML, HTTP, and URLs, revolutionized how we access and share information.
* **Alan Turing (United Kingdom):** A foundational figure in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He conceptualized the Turing machine, a model of computation, and made significant contributions to codebreaking during World War II. The Turing Award, the highest distinction in computer science, is named in his honor.
* **Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (Netherlands):** A highly influential computer scientist known for his work on algorithms, particularly Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. He also contributed significantly to the development of programming languages and formal methods.
* **Niklaus Wirth (Switzerland):** Known for designing several influential programming languages, including Pascal, Modula-2, and Oberon. He also coined the famous adage: "Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster."
* **Tony Hoare (United Kingdom):** Made fundamental contributions to the theory and design of programming languages, including the development of Quicksort, one of the most widely used sorting algorithms. He also developed Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), a formal language for describing interacting concurrent systems.

**In Machine Learning:**

* **Yann LeCun (France):** While he has worked extensively in the US, LeCun's foundational work on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was done in Europe. His research has been crucial in the development of modern computer vision. He is a recipient of the Turing Award for his work on deep learning.
* **Yoshua Bengio (Canada, with strong ties to European research):** Another Turing Award laureate, Bengio is recognized for his deep learning contributions, particularly in the area of recurrent neural networks and generative models. He has significant collaborations with European researchers and institutions.
* **Demis Hassabis (United Kingdom):** Co-founder and CEO of DeepMind (now part of Google), Hassabis has led groundbreaking work in reinforcement learning, culminating in AlphaGo, the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go.
* **Bernhard Schölkopf (Germany):** A leading researcher in kernel methods and causality in machine learning. His work has been highly influential in developing support vector machines and understanding complex relationships in data.
* **Sepp Hochreiter (Germany):** Co-inventor of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, a type of recurrent neural network that has been crucial for processing sequential data like text and time series.

**In Software Development and Related Fields:**

* **Guido van Rossum (Netherlands):** The creator of the widely popular Python programming language. His work has significantly impacted software development across various domains due to Python's readability and versatility.
* **Bjarne Stroustrup (Denmark):** The designer and original implementer of the C++ programming language, which remains a cornerstone of software development, especially for high-performance applications.
* **Linus Torvalds (Finland):** While his impact is primarily in operating systems (as the creator of the Linux kernel), this is a fundamental aspect of software infrastructure that underpins much of modern computing.

This is just a selection, and many other talented European scholars and scientists have made invaluable contributions to these fields. Europe continues to be a vibrant hub for research and innovation in computer science, machine learning, and software.

You're right, there's a wealth of brilliant minds in Europe! Let's delve deeper and highlight some more influential figures, touching upon different areas within computer science, machine learning, and software:

**Expanding on Machine Learning:**

* **Zoubin Ghahramani (United Kingdom):** A leading expert in Bayesian machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and artificial intelligence. His work has significantly advanced areas like unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and probabilistic graphical models. He was also a Chief Scientist at Uber AI.
* **Christopher Bishop (United Kingdom):** Known for his highly influential textbook "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning," which has become a standard reference in the field. He has made significant contributions to areas like Bayesian inference, neural networks, and computer vision. He was a Director of Research at Microsoft Research Cambridge.
* **Luc Van Gool (Belgium):** A prominent figure in computer vision, with significant contributions to object recognition, 3D vision, and image understanding. His work has been highly cited and influential in the development of practical computer vision systems. He has held positions at ETH Zurich and KU Leuven.
* **Joaquin Quiñonero Candela (Spain):** A leading researcher in causal inference and its applications in machine learning. He has worked on developing methods to understand cause-and-effect relationships in data, which is crucial for building more robust and interpretable AI systems. He was previously Director of Applied Machine Learning at Facebook AI.
* **Neil Lawrence (United Kingdom):** A key figure in probabilistic machine learning and the development of Gaussian processes. His work has been instrumental in providing principled ways to handle uncertainty in machine learning models. He has held positions at the University of Sheffield and Amazon.

**Further Exploration in Computer Science:**

* **Robin Milner (United Kingdom):** A Turing Award laureate for his work on the theory of concurrency and the development of the ML programming language and the LCF theorem prover. His work laid the foundations for much of modern programming language theory and formal verification.
* **C.A.R. Hoare (United Kingdom - mentioned previously but deserves further emphasis):** Beyond Quicksort, his work on formal methods, especially Hoare logic, has been fundamental to ensuring the correctness and reliability of software systems.
* **Donald Michie (United Kingdom):** A pioneer in artificial intelligence, particularly in the areas of machine learning and knowledge-based systems. He was instrumental in the development of early expert systems.
* **Maurice Wilkes (United Kingdom):** Another early pioneer in computing. He led the team that built the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC), one of the first practical stored-program electronic computers.

**More Noteworthy Figures in Software and Related Areas:**

* **Sophie Wilson (United Kingdom):** Co-designer of the ARM architecture, which now powers the vast majority of mobile devices worldwide. Her work has had an immeasurable impact on the computing landscape.
* **Hermann Maurer (Austria):** A pioneer in hypertext and early online information systems, predating the World Wide Web. His work on Hyper-G laid important groundwork for the development of the web.

This list, while still not exhaustive, provides further examples of the significant and diverse contributions of European scholars and scientists to these vital fields. Europe continues to be a hotbed of innovation, producing groundbreaking research and shaping the future of technology.
