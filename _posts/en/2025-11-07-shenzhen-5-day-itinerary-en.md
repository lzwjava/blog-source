### Planning a 5-Day Trip to Shenzhen, Guangdong

Shenzhen, the bustling tech hub in Guangdong Province, China, blends futuristic skyscrapers, ancient villages, stunning parks, and vibrant street food scenes. It's perfect for a mix of culture, nature, and urban exploration. November (like now in 2025) is an ideal time to visit—mild temperatures (15-25°C/59-77°F), low humidity, and fewer crowds post-summer. This 5-day itinerary assumes you're flying into Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport (SZX) and focuses on accessible spots via metro or rideshares. Budget: ~¥2,000-4,000/person (US$280-560) excluding flights, covering mid-range stays, food, and entry fees. Adjust for your group size or interests (e.g., add shopping or family activities).

#### Getting There
- **Flights**: Direct from major hubs like Singapore (4.5 hours, from US$220), Hong Kong (30-min ferry/train), or Guangzhou (1-hour high-speed train, ~¥80/US$11). Book via apps like Trip.com.
- **Visa**: Many nationalities (e.g., Singapore, UK) get 144-hour visa-free transit if entering/exiting via certain ports—check official rules on the Chinese embassy site as policies evolve.

#### Getting Around
- **Metro**: Efficient, English-signed lines (¥2-10/ride); download MetroMan China app for routes/maps.
- **Rideshares/Taxis**: DiDi app (from ¥10/US$1.40); link to WeChat/Alipay for payment. Avoid peak hours (7-9am, 5-7pm).
- **Payments**: Everything's cashless—set up WeChat Pay or Alipay with an international card or via a Chinese friend. Carry minimal cash for backups.

#### Where to Stay
Base in Futian (central, near malls/parks) or Nanshan (tech/beach vibe). Options:
- Budget: Qiyu Hotel (Futian, ~¥360/night/US$50).
- Mid-range: Hilton Shenzhen Shekou (Nanshan, ~¥1,400/night/US$195).
