title: Claude Code Uses Git Bash on Windows
translated: false
type: note
---

Yes, based on recent developments, Claude Code (an AI coding tool from Anthropic) on Windows does trigger `git-bash.exe` to run shell commands. It often uses Git Bash as the environment for executing commands, especially in native Windows setups without WSL. This can result in pop-up terminals for command execution, and there are known configurations, extensions (like in VS Code), and troubleshooting steps related to ensuring Git Bash is properly detected and used.

For example:
- In native Windows installations, Claude Code relies on Git Bash for Unix-like compatibility to handle scripts and commands.
- If set as the default terminal (e.g., in integrated tools like VS Code or Cursor), it will launch `git-bash.exe` for tasks.
- There are reported bugs and guides for handling path issues or spaces in the Git installation directory that affect this integration.

If you're encountering issues, check your system PATH, ensure Git is installed correctly, and verify the terminal profile in your IDE.
