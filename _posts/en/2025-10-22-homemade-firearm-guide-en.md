### Important Warnings Before Proceeding

Building a firearm at home is a serious undertaking with significant legal and safety implications. **I strongly advise against attempting this unless you are experienced with firearms, machining, and tool use, and you have consulted legal experts.** Improper construction can lead to catastrophic malfunctions, such as explosions or unintended discharges, resulting in severe injury or death to you or others. Homemade guns (often called "ghost guns") have been linked to higher failure rates due to inconsistent materials or assembly errors, and they complicate law enforcement tracing in crimes.

#### Legality
- **Federal US Law**: It is legal for non-prohibited individuals to manufacture a firearm solely for personal use without a license, serial number, or registration, as long as it's not for sale or distribution. You can use methods like 3D printing, but the firearm must be "detectable" (not entirely plastic in ways that evade metal detectors per the Gun Control Act).
- **State and Local Laws Vary Widely**: Some states (e.g., California, New York) require serialization, permits, or background checks for homemade guns. Prohibited persons (felons, domestic abusers, etc.) cannot possess any firearm. Check your local laws via the ATF or a lawyer—violations can lead to felony charges.
- **Prohibitions**: You cannot make machine guns, silencers (state-dependent), destructive devices, or auto-sears without special licensing. Selling homemade guns requires a federal firearms license.

If you're unsure, contact the ATF or a firearms attorney. In many countries outside the US, this is outright illegal.

#### Safety
- Treat every step with extreme caution: Wear eye/ear protection, work in a ventilated area, and never point a partially assembled gun at anything you aren't willing to destroy.
- Test-fire only at a professional range with expert supervision.
- If you're new to guns, take a safety course (e.g., NRA) and buy a factory-made firearm instead.

### If You're Legally Allowed and Experienced: A Basic Guide to Building a Simple Semi-Automatic Handgun

This is **not a recommendation**—it's a factual summary based on a common legal method using an "80% lower" polymer frame kit (e.g., for a Glock 17 clone). These kits are unfinished receivers you complete yourself. All parts are available online from licensed sellers, but verify compliance. The process takes 2–4 hours with basic tools.

#### Materials (Approximate Cost: $300–$500)
- 80% polymer frame kit (e.g., Polymer80 PF940v2 with jig and drill bits).
- Complete slide and barrel assembly (Glock 17 Gen 3 compatible).
- Lower parts kit (trigger assembly, springs, pins).
- Slide rails, magazine catch, slide lock, slide stop lever.
- Lubricant (e.g., RemOil).

#### Tools
- Dremel rotary tool with sanding drum.
- Metal files (flat and round), sandpaper (100–1200 grit).
- Hammer (nylon preferred), flathead screwdriver.
- Power drill (optional; Dremel works).
- Bench vise (recommended).

#### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Prep the Workspace**: Gather everything. Secure the frame in the jig (use a vise if possible). Ensure it's level.

2. **Remove Excess Polymer Tabs**: Use the Dremel to sand down the four marked tabs. Go slow to avoid over-removal—mistakes here can ruin the frame.

3. **File Smooth**: Switch to hand files for corners and edges. Don't file into the frame body.

4. **Drill Holes**: Markings guide trigger and rail holes. Drill straight, alternating sides to prevent wandering. Clean burrs with a file.

5. **Clear Guide Rod Channel**: Use Dremel or round file on the U-shaped area—precision is key.

6. **Final Sanding**: Wet-sand with WD-40 and coarse grit, then fine grit for a smooth finish.

7. **Install Slide Lock**: Insert spring, depress with screwdriver, slide in lock (lip to rear).

8. **Add Magazine Catch**: Thread spring into channel, insert catch, secure.

9. **Insert Rails**: Tap front/rear rails into frame with hammer.

10. **Assemble Trigger**: Drop in pre-assembled trigger housing.

11. **Drive Pins**: Hammer in trigger housing, front rail, and locking block pins.

12. **Add Slide Stop**: Insert lever with spring, pin through trigger hole.

13. **Attach Slide**: Lube rails, rack slide on (file if sticky).

14. **Inspect and Function Check**: Dry-fire (unloaded) multiple times. Verify all parts move freely. Do **not** live-fire without professional inspection.

After assembly, store securely and follow all gun safety rules: unloaded unless in use, locked away from kids.
