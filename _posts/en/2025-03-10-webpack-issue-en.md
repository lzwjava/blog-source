title: Webpack ResolverFactory Issue
translated: false
type: note
---

It looks like you're running into an issue with Webpack when executing `npm run build`. The error message mentions "webpack ResolverFactory" and "can not find module './ResolverFactory'", which suggests there's a problem with how Webpack is trying to locate or use its internal `ResolverFactory` module. This is unusual because `ResolverFactory` is a core part of Webpack, not something you'd typically import as a relative module like `./ResolverFactory`. Let's break down what's likely going wrong and how to fix it.

### What's Causing the Error?
The error indicates that somewhere in your project or its dependencies, there's an attempt to load a module from a relative path `./ResolverFactory`, which doesn't exist. This is problematic because:
- **`ResolverFactory` is an internal Webpack module**, usually accessed via `require('webpack').ResolverFactory` or similar, not from a relative path like `./ResolverFactory`.
- **The `./` suggests a misunderstanding**, as it implies Webpack is looking for a file named `ResolverFactory.js` in the current directory, which isn't how Webpack's internals are structured.

This typically points to one of the following issues:
- A **typo or misconfiguration** in your Webpack configuration file (e.g., `webpack.config.js`).
- A **custom plugin or loader** incorrectly trying to import or use `ResolverFactory`.
- A **dependency issue**, possibly with an outdated or corrupted Webpack installation.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue
Here’s how you can troubleshoot and fix this error:

#### 1. Search Your Project for `"./ResolverFactory"`
   - The error likely stems from an incorrect `require` or `import` statement trying to load `./ResolverFactory` instead of accessing it properly from Webpack.
   - Use your IDE’s search functionality or run this command in your project directory to find where this is happening:
     ```bash
     grep -r "\./ResolverFactory" .
     ```
   - **If found in your code** (e.g., in `webpack.config.js` or a custom plugin), correct it to properly import from Webpack. For example:
     ```javascript
     const { ResolverFactory } = require('webpack');
     ```
   - **If found in a dependency** (inside `node_modules`), proceed to step 3.

#### 2. Check Your Webpack Configuration
   - Open your `webpack.config.js` (or any other Webpack config file) and look for references to `ResolverFactory`.
   - Ensure that if it’s used, it’s accessed correctly via the Webpack API, not as a relative module.
   - Verify there are no typos or incorrect paths that might confuse Webpack’s module resolution.

#### 3. Inspect Custom Plugins or Loaders
   - If you’re using custom Webpack plugins or loaders, check their source code for incorrect imports or usages of `ResolverFactory`.
   - Look for lines like `require('./ResolverFactory')` and correct them to use the proper Webpack import.
   - For third-party plugins or loaders, check for updates:
     ```bash
     npm update <plugin-name>
     ```
   - If the plugin is outdated or unmaintained, you might need to fork it and fix the issue yourself.

#### 4. Verify Webpack Installation
   - A corrupted or outdated Webpack installation can cause unexpected errors. Check your Webpack version:
     ```bash
     npm list webpack
     ```
   - If it’s missing or outdated, reinstall it:
     ```bash
     npm install webpack --save-dev
     ```
   - For a thorough fix, delete your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`, then reinstall all dependencies:
     ```bash
     rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
     npm install
     ```

#### 5. Test with a Minimal Configuration
   - To isolate the issue, create a minimal `webpack.config.js`:
     ```javascript
     const path = require('path');
     module.exports = {
       entry: './src/index.js', // Adjust to your entry file
       output: {
         filename: 'bundle.js',
         path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
       },
     };
     ```
   - Update your `package.json` build script if necessary (e.g., `"build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"`), then run:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - If this works, gradually add back your original configurations (plugins, loaders, etc.) until the error reappears to identify the culprit.

#### 6. Enable Verbose Logging for More Insight
   - Run Webpack with verbose output to get more details:
     ```bash
     webpack --config webpack.config.js --verbose
     ```
   - Check your `package.json` to see what your `build` script does (e.g., `"build": "webpack"`), and modify it temporarily to include `--verbose`. The logs might pinpoint the problematic module or plugin.

#### 7. Check Node.js and Webpack Compatibility
   - Ensure your Node.js version is compatible with your Webpack version (e.g., Webpack 5 requires Node.js 10.13.0+). Check your Node.js version:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - Update Node.js if needed using a tool like `nvm` or by downloading from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

### What's Likely Wrong
The most probable cause is a **typo or misconfiguration** in your Webpack setup, where `ResolverFactory` is incorrectly referenced as a relative module (`./ResolverFactory`) instead of being imported from the `webpack` package. Alternatively, a custom plugin or loader might be at fault.

### How to Fix It
- **If the issue is in your code:** Correct the import to use `require('webpack').ResolverFactory` or the appropriate Webpack API.
- **If it’s in a dependency:** Update the package or patch it if necessary.
- **If you’re unsure:** Use the minimal configuration and verbose logging to pinpoint the issue, then adjust your configuration or reinstall dependencies as needed.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "can not find module './ResolverFactory'" error and successfully run `npm run build`. If the problem persists, consider providing more details about your project setup (e.g., `webpack.config.js`, `package.json`, or the full error log) for further assistance.
