title: Preventing Outlook from Deleting Zoom Meeting Links
translated: false
---

To prevent Outlook from deleting the Zoom meeting link after you reply to a meeting invitation, you need to adjust a specific setting in Outlook's options. By default, Outlook is configured to automatically delete meeting request emails from your inbox after you respond to them (e.g., accept, decline, or tentatively respond). Since the Zoom meeting link is included in the original meeting request email, deleting the email removes easy access to the link. Follow the steps below to change this setting and keep the meeting request email (and the Zoom link) in your inbox.

### **Steps to Prevent Outlook from Deleting Zoom Meeting Links After Replying**

1. **Open Outlook Options**:
   - In the Outlook desktop application, click on the **File** tab in the top-left corner.
   - From the dropdown menu, select **Options**. This will open the Outlook Options dialog box.

2. **Navigate to Mail Settings**:
   - In the Outlook Options dialog box, click on **Mail** in the left-hand menu. This section contains settings related to how Outlook handles your emails, including meeting requests.

3. **Adjust the Meeting Request Setting**:
   - Scroll down to the **Send Messages** section within the Mail settings.
   - Look for the option that says **"Delete meeting requests and notifications from Inbox after responding"**.
   - **Uncheck** this option. By doing so, you are telling Outlook to keep the meeting request emails in your inbox even after you've responded to them.

4. **Save the Changes**:
   - Click **OK** to close the Outlook Options dialog box and save your changes.

### **How It Works**
Once you've made this adjustment, Outlook will no longer automatically delete meeting request emails after you respond. This means that the original email containing the Zoom meeting link will remain in your inbox, allowing you to access the link whenever you need it.

### **Important Notes**
- **Scope of the Setting**: This setting applies to all meeting requests, not just those for Zoom meetings. It will affect how Outlook handles any meeting invitations you receive, such as those for Microsoft Teams or other platforms.
- **Outlook Web Access (OWA)**: If you are using Outlook Web Access (OWA) instead of the desktop application, the setting might be located differently.
