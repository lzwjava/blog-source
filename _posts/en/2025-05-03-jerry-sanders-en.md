Walter Jeremiah "Jerry" Sanders III (born September 12, 1936) is an American businessman, engineer, and visionary leader who played a pivotal role in shaping the semiconductor industry and Silicon Valley’s culture. As the co-founder and long-time CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) from 1969 to 2002, Sanders transformed AMD from a small startup into a global powerhouse, establishing it as the primary competitor to Intel in the microprocessor market. Known for his flamboyant personality, innovative leadership, and commitment to fairness, Sanders is widely regarded as one of Silicon Valley’s founding architects, leaving a lasting legacy through his contributions to technology, employee-centric business practices, and industry advocacy.

### Early Life and Education
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Sanders grew up on the South Side, raised by his paternal grandparents in modest circumstances. His early life was marked by resilience; at 18, he survived a brutal attack by a street gang, which left him so severely injured that a priest administered last rites. This near-death experience shaped his tenacity and drive. Sanders earned an academic scholarship from the Pullman railroad car company to attend the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1958. His technical education laid the foundation for his career in the burgeoning semiconductor industry.

### Early Career
After graduation, Sanders began his career at the Douglas Aircraft Company, working as an engineer. He later joined Motorola, gaining experience in the semiconductor sector, before moving to Fairchild Semiconductor in 1961. At Fairchild, a cradle of Silicon Valley innovation, Sanders transitioned from engineering to sales and marketing, where his charisma and strategic acumen shone. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming Group Director of Marketing Worldwide and a candidate for a top vice presidency. However, in 1968, a new conservative management team, led by C. Lester Hogan from Motorola (nicknamed "Hogan’s Heroes"), clashed with Sanders’ bold, boisterous style, leading to his firing. Sanders later reflected, “My whole life has been about treating people fairly, and I wasn’t treated fairly,” a sentiment that fueled his determination to forge his own path.

### Founding AMD and Leadership
In 1969, eight Fairchild engineers, disillusioned with the company’s direction, decided to start a new venture and invited Sanders to join them. He agreed on the condition that he serve as president, a demand that, despite causing some tension, was accepted. On May 1, 1969, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was founded in Sunnyvale, California, with Sanders as its president and CEO. Under his leadership, AMD grew from a second-source manufacturer of other companies’ chips to a major innovator in microprocessors, chipsets, and graphics processing units.

Sanders infused AMD with a strong sales and marketing orientation, leveraging his Fairchild experience to make the company competitive despite initial technological and manufacturing gaps. His motto, “People first, products and profit will follow,” became a guiding principle, printed for every AMD employee. He pioneered employee-centric practices, such as granting stock options to all employees—a novel concept at the time—and implementing a cash profit-sharing program that distributed checks of $1,000 or more during prosperous quarters. Notably, during AMD’s first $1 million quarter, Sanders personally handed each employee $100 as they left the office.

During economic downturns, such as the 1974 recession and 1979 stagflation, Sanders refused to lay off employees, a stark contrast to the widespread layoffs at Fairchild and other firms. Instead, he adopted a Japanese-inspired approach, asking employees to work Saturdays to accelerate product development and maintain competitiveness. This “cradle-to-grave” strategy fostered loyalty and drove innovation, enabling AMD to rival larger competitors with fewer resources.

### Key Achievements and Industry Impact
One of Sanders’ most significant achievements was securing a 1982 licensing deal with Intel, allowing AMD to produce Intel’s x86 processors as a second source for IBM PCs. This agreement positioned AMD as Intel’s primary competitor, a rivalry that defined the microprocessor market for decades. Sanders capitalized on the deal’s open-ended legal language to reverse-engineer and clone Intel’s 8086 processor, though this led to a countersuit from Intel that nearly bankrupted AMD. His strategic vision also led to AMD’s development of the K6 processor, challenging Intel’s dominance during the 1990s.

Sanders’ influence extended beyond AMD. He co-founded several influential industry groups, including the Semiconductor Industry Association, the Santa Clara Manufacturing Group, the Semiconductor Research Corporation, SEMATECH, and the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation. These organizations strengthened the semiconductor ecosystem, fostering collaboration and innovation. His leadership earned him recognition as the best CEO in the semiconductor industry by The Wall Street Transcript in 1983, 1984, and 1985, and runner-up in 1991.

### Leadership Style and Personality
Sanders’ flamboyant and charismatic leadership style set him apart in an industry dominated by introverted engineers. Described as “Hollywood” by some, he was known for theatrical gestures to inspire his workforce, such as delivering Patton-like speeches, appearing as “Illinois Jerry” in Indiana Jones-style posters, or emerging at sales meetings in a pink jumpsuit amid a cloud of smoke. Despite criticism for his high compensation—often ranking among the Bay Area’s highest-paid executives—and lavish lifestyle, including owning a Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, and Aston Martin, Sanders was lauded for his fairness and loyalty. Colleagues like George Scalise, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, emphasized his leadership qualities and sense of justice, noting, “He’s one of the nicest people in the world to work for.”

### Later Career and Legacy
In 2000, Sanders recruited Héctor Ruiz, then president of Motorola’s Semiconductor Products Sector, to serve as AMD’s president and COO, grooming him as his successor. Ruiz took over as CEO in 2002, with Sanders remaining chairman until April 2004, marking 35 years with AMD. After retiring, Sanders remained a visible figure, honored by AMD through endowments like the W.J. “Jerry” Sanders III–Advanced Micro Devices Endowed Chair in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, established in 2001 with a $2.5 million gift. The university also sponsors the W.J. “Jerry” Sanders Creative Design Competition, inspiring engineering students.

Sanders’ legacy is multifaceted. He is credited with creating the semiconductor sales model, blending engineering with charisma, and fostering a people-first culture that prioritized employee welfare and innovation. His maxim, “Real men have fabs,” underscored his belief in the importance of manufacturing, though he later acknowledged the rise of fabless semiconductor companies. As one of the last of Silicon Valley’s founding generation to lead a company, Sanders’ colorful personality and strategic foresight left an indelible mark on the industry.

### Personal Life
Sanders has four children: three from his first marriage and one from his second marriage to Tawny, with whom he resides. His early life challenges and professional setbacks instilled a resilience that defined his career, while his commitment to fairness and employee empowerment reflected his personal values.

### Conclusion
Jerry Sanders III’s journey from a tough Chicago childhood to the helm of AMD is a testament to his resilience, vision, and leadership. As a co-founder of AMD and a pioneer of Silicon Valley, he not only built a company that challenged industry giants but also reshaped corporate culture with his employee-first philosophy. His contributions to the semiconductor industry, through innovation, advocacy, and mentorship, continue to influence technology and business practices today, cementing his status as a legendary figure in American entrepreneurship.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Sanders_%28businessman%29)[](https://www.chiphistory.org/741-jerry-sanders-iii-hof)[](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/PROFILE-Jerry-Sanders-Silicon-Valley-s-tough-2873326.php)
