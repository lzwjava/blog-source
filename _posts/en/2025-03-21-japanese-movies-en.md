I don’t have direct access to current data from The Pirate Bay or similar platforms to tell you exactly what’s trending there as of March 21, 2025. However, I can give you a solid rundown of Japanese movies, cartoons (anime), and videos that are generally popular and likely to be found on torrent sites like The Pirate Bay, based on their widespread appeal and historical popularity among fans. These are the kinds of titles that tend to circulate widely in online communities.

### Popular Japanese Anime Movies
Anime films are a huge draw, especially those from acclaimed directors or studios like Studio Ghibli. Here are some that are consistently popular and often shared:
- **Spirited Away (2001)** - Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, this Oscar-winning film about a girl trapped in a spirit world is a global sensation. Its stunning visuals and deep story make it a perennial favorite.
- **Princess Mononoke (1997)** - Another Miyazaki masterpiece, this epic tale of nature versus industrialization is beloved for its complex characters and environmental themes.
- **Akira (1988)** - Katsuhiro Otomo’s cyberpunk classic about a dystopian Tokyo and a psychic biker is a cult hit, often torrented for its groundbreaking animation.
- **Your Name (2016)** - Makoto Shinkai’s body-swapping romance became one of the highest-grossing anime films ever, appealing to both anime fans and casual viewers.
- **Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train (2020)** - This action-packed extension of the hit series broke box office records, making it a hot item for download.

### Popular Japanese Anime Series
Anime series tend to dominate torrent sites due to their episode count and fan demand. Here are some that are likely popular picks:
- **Naruto / Naruto: Shippuden** - This ninja saga by Masashi Kishimoto has a massive following, with its action and emotional arcs driving downloads.
- **One Piece** - Eiichiro Oda’s pirate adventure, with over 1,000 episodes, is a staple for fans who want the full journey of Luffy and crew.
- **Attack on Titan** - Hajime Isayama’s dark tale of humanity versus Titans has gripping seasons that keep it in high demand.
- **Dragon Ball Z** - Akira Toriyama’s iconic series about Goku’s battles is a nostalgic and action-packed favorite.
- **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** - This critically acclaimed series about alchemy and sacrifice is a go-to for its tight storytelling.

### Popular Japanese Live-Action Movies
Live-action films from Japan also have a strong presence, especially those with international buzz:
- **Battle Royale (2000)** - Kinji Fukasaku’s brutal survival thriller about students forced to fight to the death is a cult classic.
- **Ringu (1998)** - Hideo Nakata’s horror film about a cursed videotape sparked a global craze and is still widely shared.
- **Seven Samurai (1954)** - Akira Kurosawa’s epic about warriors defending a village is a timeless masterpiece that film buffs often seek out.
- **Departures (2008)** - Yojiro Takita’s Oscar-winning drama about a man finding purpose in death rituals resonates deeply and circulates among cinephiles.
- **Shoplifters (2018)** - Hirokazu Kore-eda’s poignant family drama won the Palme d’Or and attracts viewers for its emotional depth.

### Why These on The Pirate Bay?
The Pirate Bay users typically gravitate toward content that’s either hard to access legally, newly released, or has a dedicated fanbase. Studio Ghibli films, for instance, were historically tough to stream outside Japan until recent deals with platforms like Netflix, so they’ve long been torrent staples. Blockbusters like *Demon Slayer: Mugen Train* or *Your Name* spike in downloads after theatrical runs, while older classics like *Akira* and *Seven Samurai* endure due to their reputation. Anime series with long runs (*One Piece*, *Naruto*) are also popular because fans want entire collections without subscription hassles.

Keep in mind that what’s “popular” on The Pirate Bay shifts with release cycles, fan hype, and availability elsewhere. For the latest trends, you’d need to check the site directly or look at torrent trackers, but these titles are safe bets based on their enduring appeal and cultural impact.
