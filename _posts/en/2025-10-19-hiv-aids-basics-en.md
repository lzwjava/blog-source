### What is HIV?

HIV stands for **Human Immunodeficiency Virus**. It is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically the CD4 cells (T cells), which help fight infections. If left untreated, HIV weakens the immune system over time, making it harder for the body to combat other diseases.

#### Key Facts About HIV:
- **Transmission**: HIV spreads through certain body fluids (blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids) entering the bloodstream or mucous membranes. Common ways include unprotected anal or vaginal sex, sharing needles/syringes, or from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. It does **not** spread through saliva, sweat, tears, casual contact, or air.
- **Stages**:
  - **Acute Infection**: Occurs 2–4 weeks after exposure; flu-like symptoms (fever, rash, sore throat) are common, and the virus is highly contagious.
  - **Chronic Infection**: Lasts years; may have no symptoms but the virus continues to replicate.
  - **Progression to AIDS**: Without treatment, it advances to the final stage.
- **Symptoms**: Vary by stage; early signs mimic the flu, later stages involve weight loss, fever, swollen glands, and frequent infections.
- **Treatment**: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses the virus, allowing people to live long, healthy lives. Achieving an "undetectable" viral load prevents transmission to others (U=U: Undetectable = Untransmittable).
- **Testing**: The only way to know for sure; recommended for everyone ages 13–64 at least once, more often if at risk.

There is no cure, but with modern treatment, HIV is a manageable chronic condition.

### What is AIDS?

AIDS stands for **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome**. It is not a separate virus but the most advanced stage of HIV infection, where the immune system is severely damaged (CD4 count below 200 cells/mm³ or presence of opportunistic infections).

#### Key Facts About AIDS:
- **Relation to HIV**: Everyone with AIDS has HIV, but not everyone with HIV develops AIDS. Effective treatment prevents progression.
- **Symptoms**: Severe—includes rapid weight loss, recurring fever, extreme fatigue, prolonged swelling of lymph glands, diarrhea lasting over a week, sores in mouth/anus/genitals, pneumonia, memory loss, and cancers like Kaposi's sarcoma.
- **Transmission Risk**: People with AIDS have high viral loads, increasing the chance of spreading HIV.
- **Treatment and Outlook**: ART can reverse progression if started early; without it, survival is typically about 3 years. Today, with treatment, most people never reach this stage.
- **Diagnosis**: Based on CD4 count or specific opportunistic infections (e.g., Pneumocystis pneumonia).

Early HIV detection and treatment are crucial to prevent AIDS.
