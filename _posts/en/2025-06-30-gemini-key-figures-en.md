Identifying the top 30 tech talents, researchers, or engineers specifically working on Google’s Gemini project is challenging due to limited publicly available information about the exact individuals involved. Google, like many tech giants, doesn’t typically release detailed employee lists for specific projects, and the Gemini project (a family of multimodal large language models developed by Google DeepMind) involves contributions from a broad team of researchers and engineers across Google DeepMind, Google Brain, and other divisions. However, I can provide insight into key figures associated with Google’s AI efforts, particularly those likely linked to Gemini, based on available information, and outline some notable contributors in Google’s AI and DeepMind divisions. Since I can’t provide a definitive list of 30 individuals working exclusively on Gemini, I’ll focus on prominent researchers, engineers, and leaders in Google’s AI ecosystem, including those who may have contributed to or influenced Gemini’s development.

### Key Figures in Google’s AI and Gemini Development
Here are some notable individuals associated with Google’s AI research, particularly at Google DeepMind and Google Brain, which merged to support projects like Gemini. These individuals are either explicitly mentioned in connection with Gemini or are prominent in Google’s AI leadership:

1. **Demis Hassabis** – CEO of DeepMind, Hassabis is a central figure in Google’s AI strategy post the 2023 Google Brain-DeepMind merger. He co-announced Gemini 1.0 in December 2023 with Sundar Pichai and is likely a key overseer of Gemini’s development. His work on AlphaGo and AlphaFold highlights his expertise in advancing AI research.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_%28language_model%29)
2. **Sundar Pichai** – CEO of Google and Alphabet, Pichai announced Gemini at the Google I/O keynote in May 2023 and has been instrumental in positioning Gemini as a competitor to models like GPT-4. While not a researcher, his strategic oversight shapes Google’s AI direction, including Gemini.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_%28language_model%29)
3. **Sergey Brin** – Google co-founder, Brin came out of retirement to assist with Gemini’s development, credited as a “core contributor.” His involvement underscores the project’s significance, particularly in leveraging YouTube video transcripts for training, with efforts to filter copyrighted materials.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_%28language_model%29)
4. **Jeff Dean** – Chief Scientist at Google, Dean leads AI research efforts and has been pivotal since the 2018 Google AI restructuring. At a 2025 AI convention, he predicted AI systems like Gemini could soon operate at junior engineer levels, suggesting his influence on Gemini’s advanced capabilities.[](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/express-mobility/auto-technology/ai-to-operate-like-junior-engineers-within-googles-jeff-dean-makes-bold-prediction/3848677/)
5. **Oriol Vinyals** – Research Director at DeepMind, Vinyals is known for his work on sequence-to-sequence learning and AlphaStar. As a senior leader, he likely contributes to Gemini’s multimodal and reasoning advancements.
6. **Zoubin Ghahramani** – Vice President of Research at Google, Ghahramani focuses on machine learning and probabilistic models. His role in Google Research likely ties to Gemini’s technical architecture, such as its mixture-of-experts approach.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_%28language_model%29)
7. **Noam Shazeer** – Formerly at Google, Shazeer co-invented the Transformer model, foundational to modern LLMs like Gemini. While he left Google for Character.AI, his earlier work likely influenced Gemini’s architecture.
8. **Lukasz Kaiser** – A senior researcher at Google, Kaiser works on natural language processing and was involved in earlier LLMs like PaLM 2, a predecessor to Gemini. His expertise likely supports Gemini’s language capabilities.
9. **Will Grannis** – CTO at Google Cloud, Grannis has discussed Gemini 2.0’s impact on business applications, indicating involvement in its practical deployment.[](https://cloud.google.com/transform/gemini-2-0-what-it-means-for-you)
10. **Yoshua Bengio** (consulting role) – While primarily affiliated with Mila, Bengio collaborates with Google on AI ethics and safety, potentially influencing Gemini’s safety evaluations.[](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/)

### Broader Contributors
Beyond these named individuals, Gemini’s development involves teams of researchers and engineers from Google DeepMind, Google Brain, and other Google divisions. Here’s a breakdown of the types of contributors likely involved:

- **Google DeepMind Researchers**: DeepMind’s team, post-merger with Google Brain in 2023, includes experts in reinforcement learning (e.g., from AlphaGo) and multimodal AI, critical for Gemini’s capabilities in processing text, images, audio, and video.[](https://sifted.eu/articles/deepmind-talent)
- **Google Brain Alumni**: Engineers and researchers from Google Brain, known for work on Transformers and large-scale AI, contributed to Gemini’s foundation. Some may have transitioned to DeepMind or other Google AI teams.
- **Software Engineers**: Gemini’s ability to generate code (e.g., turning sketches into Jetpack Compose code in Android Studio) suggests involvement from Google’s software engineering teams, particularly those focused on developer tools.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_%28language_model%29)
- **Safety and Ethics Experts**: Gemini 1.0 underwent extensive safety evaluations for bias and toxicity, involving researchers from Google’s Responsibility and Safety Committee and external partners like the Allen Institute for AI.[](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/)
- **Product Integration Teams**: Engineers integrating Gemini into Google products (e.g., Bard, Pixel 8 Pro, Gmail, Docs) are crucial for its deployment. For instance, Gemini Nano powers features like Summarize in Pixel’s Recorder app.[](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/)

### Challenges in Identifying a Full List
- **Lack of Specific Attribution**: Google doesn’t publicly disclose individual contributors for Gemini, citing hundreds of engineers and researchers, including those from DeepMind and Google Brain.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_%28language_model%29)
- **Talent Mobility**: Some top AI talents, like former DeepMind researchers Cyprien de Masson d’Autume and Michael Johanson, have left to start ventures like Reka AI and Artificial.Agency, reducing the pool of known contributors.[](https://sifted.eu/articles/deepmind-talent)
- **Global Talent Distribution**: Google’s AI teams span locations like Mountain View, Atlanta, Cambridge, and Zürich, with researchers collaborating globally, making it hard to pinpoint specific individuals.[](https://research.google/careers/)

### Notable Trends and Context
- **China’s AI Talent Influence**: Research from 2024 indicates China produces nearly half of the world’s top AI researchers, with many completing doctorates in the U.S. and staying to work at companies like Google. This talent pool likely contributes to Gemini’s development, though specific names are not public.[](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/technology/china-ai-talent.html)
- **Gemini’s Technical Achievements**: Gemini 2.5 Pro, released in March 2025, excels in coding (topping WebDev Arena) and reasoning, suggesting a strong team of NLP and coding specialists.[](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/)
- **Attrition Concerns**: Some DeepMind researchers left due to a shift toward product-focused work post-merger, potentially impacting Gemini’s foundational research but not its commercial output.[](https://sifted.eu/articles/deepmind-talent)

### Recommendations for Further Inquiry
To identify more specific contributors:
- Check Google Research’s publications (research.google) for papers on Gemini or related multimodal models, as authors are often listed.
- Explore LinkedIn for profiles of Google DeepMind or Google AI employees mentioning Gemini-related work.
