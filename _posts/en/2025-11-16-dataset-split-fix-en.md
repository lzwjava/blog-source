title: Fixing Dataset Split Error
translated: false
type: note
---

The error occurs because your local dataset file (`/home/lzw/projects/nanoGPT/data/openwebtext_local/openwebtext.txt`) contains only 1 sample (likely a single line or empty-ish content), but the script attempts to split it into train/test sets with `test_size=0.1`. This would allocate ~0.1 samples to the test set (rounded to 1 sample) and leave 0 for training, which `datasets.train_test_split()` rejects to avoid an empty train set.

### Quick Fixes
1. **Use a larger/more complete dataset**:
   - The nanoGPT OpenWebText preparation expects a substantial corpus (millions of documents). Your local `openwebtext.txt` seems incomplete—possibly just a placeholder or failed download.
   - Download a proper OpenWebText sample or subset:
     - Clone the OpenWebText repo: `git clone https://github.com/jcpeterson/openwebtext.git` into `data/openwebtext_local/`.
     - Or use a pre-processed version from Hugging Face: Install `datasets` if not already (`pip install datasets`), then modify `prepare.py` to load via `load_dataset("openwebtext", split="train")` instead of a local file.
     - For testing, create a dummy multi-line file in `openwebtext.txt` with at least 10+ lines of sample text (e.g., repeat "Hello world." multiple times) to get past the split.

2. **Modify the split in `prepare.py`** (around line 50):
   - If you must use this tiny file for debugging, change the split parameters:
     ```python
     # Original (causes error):
     split_dataset = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.1, seed=2357, shuffle=True)

     # Option A: Skip splitting entirely (no test set, just train on all):
     split_dataset = {"train": dataset}  # Or set test_size=0

     # Option B: Use a smaller test_size that works with n=1 (e.g., 0, or handle tiny datasets):
     if len(dataset) <= 1:
         split_dataset = {"train": dataset}
     else:
         split_dataset = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.1, seed=2357, shuffle=True)
     ```
   - Re-run: `python data/openwebtext_local/prepare.py`.

3. **Verify your dataset size**:
   - Add a print statement before the split in `prepare.py` (line ~45):
     ```python
     print(f"Dataset size: {len(dataset)}")
     ```
   - Run again to confirm— it should output `1`. If the file is empty/corrupt, regenerate it or check file permissions/encoding (UTF-8 expected).

### Recommended Next Steps for nanoGPT
- For full training, follow nanoGPT's official data prep: See the [nanoGPT README](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT#data) for downloading/preparing Shakespeare or OpenWebText properly. OpenWebText requires significant storage (~40GB uncompressed).
- If this is for local testing, switch to the built-in Shakespeare dataset (smaller, no external downloads needed): Edit `prepare.py` to load `load_dataset("tiny_shakespeare")` or use nanoGPT's `data/shakespeare_char/prepare.py`.
- Ensure dependencies: `pip install datasets torch` (and others from nanoGPT's `requirements.txt`).

If you share more of `prepare.py` or the file contents, I can provide a patched version.
