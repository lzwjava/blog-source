### Major Differences Between IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 9.0 and 8.0

IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) is an enterprise-grade Java EE application server. Version 8.0 (released in 2011) introduced Java EE 6 compliance, while Version 9.0 (released in 2017) advanced to Java EE 7 with a focus on modernizing the traditional profile to align with lighter, cloud-friendly runtimes like Liberty. Below, I'll outline the key differences in a table for clarity, based on official IBM documentation and release notes. These span Java support, standards compliance, architecture, and deployment.

| Aspect                  | WAS 8.0                                                                 | WAS 9.0                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Java SE Support**    | Defaults to Java SE 6; optional support for Java SE 7 via configuration. | Defaults to Java SE 8 as the primary platform, using IBM SDK Java 8 for full compatibility with Oracle Java 8. This enables lambda expressions, streams, and other SE 8 features. |
| **Java EE Compliance** | Full Java EE 6 support, including JPA 2.0, JSF 2.0, and Servlet 3.0.    | Full Java EE 7 support, adding features like WebSocket 1.0, JSON-P 1.0, Batch 1.0, and enhanced concurrency utilities. This brings the traditional edition up to par with Liberty's capabilities from earlier versions. |
| **Liberty Profile Integration** | Liberty introduced in 8.5 (not in 8.0 core); 8.0 focuses on traditional full-profile only. | Deeply integrated Liberty runtime (version 16.0.0.2) as a lightweight, modular alternative to the full profile, optimized for cloud-native apps. Liberty is bundled and supports continuous delivery. |
| **Deployment Model**   | Primarily on-premises; installed via Installation Manager with editions like Base and Network Deployment (ND) for clustering. | First version released simultaneously as on-premises and as-a-Service on IBM Cloud. Supports hybrid cloud deployments with better containerization hooks. |
| **Performance & Management** | Up to 20-26% throughput gains over WAS 7; intelligent management in ND edition. | Builds on 8.0 with further optimizations for resource efficiency; enhanced administrative tools for migration and configuration comparison. |
| **End of Support**     | Extended support ended in 2019; no longer receives fixes.              | Active support through at least 2027, with regular fix packs (e.g., 9.0.5.x) addressing security and compatibility. |
| **Migration Considerations** | N/A (baseline).                                                        | Easier migration from 8.x via tools like the Configuration Comparison Tool; automatic port alignment and deprecated API handling for Java SE 8 transition. |

#### Key Takeaways
- **Biggest Leap**: The shift to Java EE 7 and Java SE 8 is the most significant, enabling modern Java features and standards that were previewed in Liberty earlier. If you're running legacy Java EE 6 apps, migration to 9.0 is straightforward but may require testing for SE 8-specific changes.
- **When to Upgrade**: Choose 9.0 for cloud/hybrid needs or EE 7 features; stick with 8.0 (or patch to 8.5.5) only for short-term maintenance of older apps.
- For detailed migration guides, check IBM's official docs.
