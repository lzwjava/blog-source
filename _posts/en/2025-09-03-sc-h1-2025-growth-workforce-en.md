Here’s what I found regarding Standard Chartered’s performance and workforce as of the first half of 2025:

### H1 2025 Revenue & Key Financial Highlights

* **Operating income (i.e., revenue):** USD 10.9 billion in H1 2025, a 10 % YoY increase on a constant currency basis ([sc.com][1]).
* **Pretax profit:** Approximately USD 4.38 billion, marking a 26 % increase compared to analysts’ expectations ([reuters.com][2], [fitchratings.com][3]).

So in simpler terms, Standard Chartered’s “revenue” in the first six months of 2025 was **USD 10.9 billion**.

### Workforce — Number of Employees (Contractors Not Specified)

* As of 2025, Standard Chartered reports having **83,000 employees worldwide** ([en.wikipedia.org][4]).
* Their careers page likewise confirms: “Our 83,000 employees work across 52 markets” ([sc.com][5]).
* Historical data from Macrotrends shows employee figures for 2024 at 81,145, and 2023 at 85,007 — again, this is for employees, not including contractors ([macrotrends.net][6]).

Unfortunately, there is no clear public breakdown available for contractors or contingent workers during H1 2025, so I can’t provide a number on that front.

### Summary (No Tables – as requested)

* **First-half 2025 Revenue (Operating Income):** USD 10.9 billion (up 10 % YoY at constant currency)
* **Pre-tax Profit (H1 2025):** USD 4.38 billion (approximate, 26 % above estimates)
* **Global Employees:** About 83,000 (contractors not specified)

If you're looking for insight into contractors or contract staffing details, those figures are typically disclosed in more granular internal reporting or specific sustainability/annual reports and might require direct access to investor relations or human resources disclosures.

Let me know if you'd like help digging into their annual report PDF or locating any such breakdowns—I can guide you there!
