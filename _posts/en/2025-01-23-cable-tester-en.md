## Network Cable Tester

I recently purchased a network cable tester from JD.com. I have seen network consultants come to my home or my employer's office to test the network.

This device is very inexpensive, costing only about 10 CNY. A similar product at Walmart would cost around 10 USD.

For this post, I am using an image from Amazon.com.

## Mesh Router

I started using a Mesh router in 2023. I purchased a TP-Link AX3000 system consisting of two mesh routers - a primary unit and a satellite unit. It cost me around 484 CNY at that time, but now it only costs 395 CNY on JD.com.

I initially used this system in my large house, but later moved it to my parents' house.

During some days of the 2025 Spring Festival, my family stayed in my large house and experienced poor WiFi network quality again. To address this, I purchased another mesh router - the ZTE AC1200, which costs around 108 CNY.

Similar products available at Walmart include the TP-Link WiFi Mesh Router, Eero Dual Band Mesh Router, and NetGear Nighthawk AX3000. The prices of most of these products range from 50 USD to 200 USD.

For the ZTE AC1200 mesh router, I could simply purchase one and use bridge mode, allowing it to receive a WiFi signal and then emit its own WiFi signal. It works perfectly. Originally, the router's domain address was 192.168.5.1. After enabling bridge mode, this IP address is no longer accessible. Instead, 192.168.1.1 will redirect you to the main router in your home network. At this point, you can access the router's control center by navigating to http://zte.home.

If you can access the main router, you can see the connected devices and their IP addresses. Then, you can try to access each device to determine which one is the sub-router. In my case, it was 192.168.1.23, which is the address of the ZTE AC1200 mesh router.

For mobile phones, which we move around the home, it is better to use the 2.4 GHz channel as it is more stable. For laptops or desktop computers, which we typically use in our bedrooms or study rooms, it is better to use the 5 GHz channel as it is faster.
