## Network Cable Tester

I recently purchased a network cable tester from JD.com. I have seen network consultants come to my home or my employer's office to test the network.

This device is very inexpensive, costing only about 10 CNY. A similar product at Walmart would cost around 10 USD.

For this post, I am using an image from Amazon.com.

## Mesh Router

I started using a Mesh router in 2023. I purchased a TP-Link AX3000 system consisting of two mesh routers - a primary unit and a satellite unit. It cost me around 484 CNY at that time, but now it only costs 395 CNY on JD.com.

I initially used this system in my large house, but later moved it to my parents' house.

During some days of the 2025 Spring Festival, my family stayed in my large house and experienced poor WiFi network quality again. To address this, I purchased another mesh router - the ZTE AC1200, which costs around 108 CNY.

Similar products available at Walmart include the TP-Link WiFi Mesh Router, Eero Dual Band Mesh Router, and NetGear Nighthawk AX3000. The prices of most of these products range from 50 USD to 200 USD.
