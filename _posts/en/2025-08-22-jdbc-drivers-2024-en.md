The popularity of JDBC drivers depends on the database system in use, as each database typically has its own specific driver. Based on current usage trends, community adoption, and compatibility, here are some of the most popular JDBC drivers for widely used databases:

- **PostgreSQL JDBC Driver**: For PostgreSQL databases, the official `org.postgresql:postgresql` driver is widely used. It’s actively maintained, supports modern PostgreSQL features, and is favored for its reliability in Java applications. [PostgreSQL JDBC Driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/)

- **MySQL Connector/J**: For MySQL databases, the `com.mysql:mysql-connector-java` driver is the go-to choice. It’s officially supported by MySQL, widely adopted, and compatible with a broad range of MySQL versions. [MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)

- **Oracle JDBC Driver**: For Oracle databases, the `com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc8` (or newer versions like `ojdbc11`) is the standard. It’s commonly used in enterprise environments due to Oracle’s prevalence in large-scale systems. [Oracle JDBC Driver](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html)

- **Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver**: For SQL Server, Microsoft’s official `com.microsoft.sqlserver:mssql-jdbc` driver is popular. It supports a wide range of SQL Server versions and Azure SQL Database, making it a strong choice for Microsoft ecosystems.

- **H2 Database JDBC Driver**: For lightweight, embedded, or testing environments, the H2 database’s built-in JDBC driver (`org.h2:h2`) is very popular due to its simplicity and performance in Java applications. [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)

These drivers are popular because they are actively maintained, well-documented, and widely supported in frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and other Java-based systems. The choice depends on the database you’re using. If you’re working with a specific database, let me know, and I can recommend the best driver for it!
