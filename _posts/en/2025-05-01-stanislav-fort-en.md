### 🧠 What Can We Learn From Him?

1. **Understanding Neural Network Loss Landscapes**
   - Fort has contributed to research that helps explain why neural networks are trainable despite their complexity.
   - His work with colleagues suggests that the loss landscapes of neural nets contain "basins" that allow gradient-based optimization methods to find good solutions.

2. **Learning Curve Theory**
   - He co-developed a theoretical framework to predict how model performance improves with more data or larger models — crucial for resource allocation in AI development.
   - This helps answer questions like: *How much more data do we need?* or *When will increasing model size stop helping?*

3. **Generalization in Overparameterized Models**
   - Explores how modern neural networks generalize well even when they have more parameters than training examples — a paradox that challenges classical statistical learning theory.

4. **Cross-disciplinary Insights**
   - Brings tools and ideas from theoretical physics into machine learning — e.g., using concepts from chaos theory, random matrix theory, and thermodynamics.
