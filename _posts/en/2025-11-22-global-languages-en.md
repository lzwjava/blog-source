That makes sense! To cut down to just 3 or 4 languages, you need to focus on the absolute core languages with the **largest number of internet users** and the **broadest global economic reach**.

Based on internet usage and website translation data, here is the clear recommendation for which languages to keep to maximize your global audience while minimizing maintenance.

## 🎯 The Top 3-4 Languages to Keep

To keep 3-4 languages that cover the largest and fastest-growing internet audiences, you should prioritize these:

| Rank | Language | Code | Global Audience Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.** | **English** | `en` | **The Internet Default.** Most used language online (over 50% of content). Essential for global business and academia. |
| **2.** | **Simplified Chinese** | `zh` | **Largest Single Country Audience.** Second largest number of internet users globally (over 888 million). Key to accessing the massive Chinese market. |
| **3.** | **Spanish** | `es` | **Western Hemisphere Powerhouse.** Third largest number of internet users. Official language in 21 countries, covering all of Latin America and a large part of the US. |
| **4.** | **(Optional) Arabic** | `ar` | **Fastest-Growing Region.** One of the fastest-growing languages online. Essential key to the large Middle East and North Africa (MENA) markets. |

### 🛑 Languages to Delete for High Efficiency

Based on the 3-4 core choices above, here are the languages you should remove:

| Language to Delete | Code | Reason for Removal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Traditional Chinese** | `hant` | Covered by Simplified Chinese (`zh`) for the largest global audience. |
| **Hindi** | `hi` | High number of native speakers, but low internet penetration/online content share compared to the top 4. Many Indians also use English. |
| **French** | `fr` | Important globally, but internet user count and percentage of online content is lower than the Top 3. |
| **German** | `de` | Key for Europe's largest economy, but its reach is geographically limited compared to Spanish or Arabic. |
| **Japanese** | `ja` | High-value market, but the audience is highly concentrated in one country, making the global reach low compared to others. |

## ✅ Recommended Lean List (Top 3)

If you must choose **only 3** to be as efficient as possible, your list should be:

1.  **`en`** (English)
2.  **`zh`** (Simplified Chinese)
3.  **`es`** (Spanish)

This gives you a strong presence in North America, Europe (via English/Spanish), China, and Latin America.

Would you like me to focus on a specific geographic region (like Europe or Asia) to refine the list of 3-4 even further?
