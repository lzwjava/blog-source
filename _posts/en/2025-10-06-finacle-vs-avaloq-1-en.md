Avaloq, now part of NEC Corporation, is a modular, front-to-back platform focused on wealth management, retail banking, and operational efficiency. While both support core banking functions like payments, lending, and customer management, Finacle caters to a broader spectrum of banking types, whereas Avaloq excels in specialized wealth and asset management scenarios.
