### Understanding the Setup
You're working on a laptop in the front driver's seat (or "main seat") of the car, with a 30 cm long, 360-degree rotatable lamp positioned in the rear seat (behind you). The goals are:
- **Minimize screen glare**: Avoid direct light hitting the laptop screen, which could cause reflections and eye strain.
- **Maximize car brightness**: Spread light to illuminate the dashboard, seats, and interior without dark spots.

The lamp's short length (30 cm) limits its reach, so it works best as a gooseneck or clip-on style mounted on the rear seat headrest or armrest for stability. Focus on indirect lighting (bouncing off surfaces) to achieve even illumination while dodging the screen.

### Recommended Lamp Positioning
Position the lamp base securely in the rear seat (e.g., clipped to the headrest facing forward). Then, rotate and angle the lamp head as follows for optimal results:

1. **Primary Position: Ceiling Bounce (Best for Even Brightness + No Glare)**
   - **Angle**: Rotate the lamp head **upward at 45–60 degrees** toward the car's ceiling (roof liner), just behind your head.
   - **Why it works**:
     - Light diffuses softly downward across the entire cabin, brightening the dashboard, steering wheel, and your workspace without direct beams.
     - The screen (facing you forward) stays out of the light path—no reflections since the source is behind and above.
   - **Adjustment tip**: If the lamp is too short to reach fully upward, extend it forward slightly over the seatback (toward your shoulder) before angling up. Aim the beam 10–20 cm behind your head to avoid shadows on your keyboard.
   - **Expected effect**: Whole car gets a warm, ambient glow (like a dome light but brighter and targeted).

2. **Alternative: Sidewall/Door Bounce (For Focused Side Illumination)**
   - **Angle**: Rotate the lamp head **sideways (left or right) at 90 degrees**, pointing toward the rear door panel or side window, about 30–45 degrees downward.
   - **Why it works**:
     - Bounces light off reflective surfaces (door trim or glass) to fill the car horizontally, lighting up the passenger area and floor without hitting your screen directly.
     - Keeps the beam perpendicular to your line of sight, eliminating glare.
   - **Adjustment tip**: Start with the right side (passenger door) if you're in the driver's seat—this illuminates your peripherals better. Use the full 30 cm length extended horizontally for wider spread.
   - **Expected effect**: Brighter on one side; combine with occasional upward tilts for full coverage.

3. **Avoid These Angles**:
   - **Direct forward (0 degrees)**: Points straight at your back/head/screen—causes glare and hotspots.
   - **Straight down (180 degrees)**: Only lights the rear floor, wasting brightness on the front.
   - **Too low (below 30 degrees)**: Creates shadows under the seatback and potential keyboard spill.

### Quick Setup Steps

| Step | Action | Pro Tip |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1. Mount | Clip base to rear headrest, facing front. Extend arm fully (30 cm). | Use a soft clamp to avoid seat damage. |
| 2. Test Glare | Sit normally, open laptop, and shine light—adjust if you see reflections. | Dim the lamp to 50% if glare persists (most have sliders). |
| 3. Brighten Car | Scan the interior: Rotate in 15-degree increments until no dark corners. | Add a white reflector (e.g., paper) on the ceiling for extra bounce. |
| 4. Fine-Tune | Use 360-degree rotation to hybrid angles (e.g., 45° up + 30° left). | Work in short sessions; take breaks to avoid eye fatigue. |

This setup should make your car feel like a productive, glare-free office. If your lamp has adjustable brightness/color temp (e.g., warm white), set it to 3000K for comfort. If the car has tinted windows, crack them slightly for natural light synergy.
