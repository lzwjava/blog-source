Error:

This error indicates that the DeepSeek API is returning a response that is not valid JSON, possibly HTML or some other format. This is unexpected, as the API is expected to return JSON. The issue might be due to a temporary API problem, rate limiting, or an issue with the prompt. It's important to handle this gracefully by logging the error and potentially retrying.
