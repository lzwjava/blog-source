### Hong Kong's Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) – "Gaocai" Program

The "Hong Kong Gaocai" you're referring to is the **Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS)**, officially known in Chinese as **高才通計劃 (Gāo Cái Tōng Jìhuà)**, which translates to "High Talent Pass Scheme." Launched by the Hong Kong Immigration Department on December 28, 2022, it's a streamlined visa program designed to attract elite professionals and graduates from around the world—including mainland China—to live, work, or start businesses in Hong Kong. The scheme emphasizes flexibility, allowing applicants to enter without a pre-arranged job offer, making it particularly appealing for mainland talents seeking opportunities in Hong Kong's economy.

#### Key Features
- **Visa Duration**: Initial stay of up to 24 months (extended to 3 years for high-income Category A applicants as of 2025). Holders can freely switch jobs, start/join businesses, or explore opportunities during their stay.
- **Family Inclusion**: Dependants (spouse and unmarried children under 18) can join and apply for dependant visas.
- **No Job Requirement Upfront**: Unlike traditional work visas, no employment offer is needed initially, but extensions require proof of employment or business activity in Hong Kong.
- **Processing Time**: Typically 4 weeks for initial applications.
- **Quota**: No overall cap, but Category C has an annual limit of 10,000 spots (first-come, first-served).
- **Exclusions**: Not available to nationals of Afghanistan, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, Nepal, or Vietnam.
- **Success Stats**: As of late 2024, over 116,000 applications were received, with nearly 92,000 approvals, including over 75,000 talents and families arriving in Hong Kong.

The program supports Hong Kong's goal of retaining and attracting global talent amid economic challenges, with added services like job fairs through the Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) platform.

#### Eligibility Criteria
Applicants must fit one of three categories (you can only apply under one). Academic qualifications must be equivalent to a Hong Kong bachelor's degree.

| Category | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| **A: High-Income Professionals** | Annual income of at least HK$2.5 million (≈US$320,000) in the immediate preceding year. No degree or experience minimum required. |
| **B: Experienced Graduates** | Bachelor's degree or higher from one of the world's top 100 universities (based on QS, Times Higher Education, or Shanghai Jiao Tong rankings) + at least 3 years of full-time post-graduation work experience. (Updated 2025: List expanded to 198 universities, including 13 from mainland China.) |
| **C: Recent Graduates** | Bachelor's degree or higher from a top 100 university awarded within the last 5 years + less than 3 years of work experience. (Quota: 10,000/year; excludes recent Hong Kong local graduates eligible under the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates scheme.) |

Income proof can be in HKD or 17 major foreign currencies; conversions are allowed with documentation.

#### Application Process
1. **Check Eligibility**: Use the official Immigration Department (ImmD) website to verify if your university qualifies or calculate income.
2. **Online Submission**: Apply via the GovHK portal (for non-Mainland residents) or ImmD's TTPS page. Upload documents like passports, degree certificates, income proofs (e.g., tax returns, pay stubs), and work experience letters.
3. **Pay Fees**: Non-refundable application fee (HK$200–400 per person) + visa label fee (HK$500+). Payable by credit card, FPS, or Mainland digital wallets (Alipay, WeChat Pay).
4. **For Mainland Applicants**: Secure an Exit-Entry Permit (EEP) and exit endorsement from Mainland authorities first; present e-Visa QR code at Hong Kong entry.
5. **Decision & Entry**: Expect approval in 4 weeks. Successful applicants receive an e-Visa; enter Hong Kong and get a landing slip.
6. **Extensions/Renewals**: Apply up to 3 months before expiry (updated 2025 from 4 weeks). Must show employment/business proof; further extensions possible if criteria met.

Applications are straightforward with minimal paperwork compared to other schemes like the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP), which requires a job offer.

If you're a mainland talent considering this, it's a fast track to Hong Kong residency—leading to permanent status after 7 years. For personalized advice, consult ImmD or a migration expert, as the scheme's future beyond 2025 isn't guaranteed.
