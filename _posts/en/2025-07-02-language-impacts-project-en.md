Yes, you're absolutely right. The choice of programming language impacts a lot of factors that shape the development process and the success of a project. Let’s break down the key points you mentioned:

1. **Performance**: This is crucial for certain applications, especially those dealing with large-scale data or high-speed processing (e.g., gaming engines, real-time systems). Some languages, like C or Rust, are closer to hardware and offer more control over memory, resulting in better performance. Others, like Python, may sacrifice performance for ease of use.

2. **Garbage Collection (GC) and Pause Time**: Garbage collection can have a significant effect on the performance of a program. Languages like Java or C# handle memory management automatically, but this comes with GC pauses that can be unpredictable. For real-time systems, languages that allow manual memory management, like C or C++, might be preferred to avoid such pauses. However, languages with more optimized GC systems, such as Go, are also becoming increasingly popular for their balance.

3. **Syntax**: Readability and maintainability are directly tied to syntax. A clear, easy-to-understand syntax leads to fewer bugs and easier debugging. Languages like Python are known for their clean, readable syntax, while others like C++ or JavaScript can be more verbose or complex, which can make maintenance more challenging.

4. **Readability and Maintainability**: These are critical for long-term success, especially for large teams or projects that evolve over time. A language’s design philosophy and community standards around naming conventions, code organization, and documentation can greatly influence how maintainable the code is.

5. **Toolchain**: The availability of libraries, frameworks, debuggers, and build tools can make a huge difference in productivity. Languages like JavaScript and Python have huge ecosystems of libraries that can accelerate development, whereas less commonly used languages may not have as mature of a toolchain.

6. **Frameworks**: Frameworks often define how you write code in a specific language. For example, JavaScript has popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js, which shape the way you approach development. A language’s ecosystem of frameworks can determine how quickly you can get projects off the ground.

Choosing the right language often depends on the specific needs of a project, such as performance requirements, team expertise, and future scalability. Balancing all these factors is key. Do you have any language preferences or specific use cases you're focused on?
