Yes, while no mainstream production compilers (like GCC, Clang/LLVM, or MSVC) currently use GPUs or CUDA to accelerate the overall compilation process—due to challenges like branch-heavy algorithms, irregular memory access, and limited GPU suitability for general compiler tasks—there are notable research projects and prototypes that offload specific compiler phases to GPUs for significant speedups. These focus on parallelizable tasks like optimization passes, where GPUs excel at massive parallelism.

### Key Examples:
- **GPU-Accelerated Dataflow Analysis**: A research implementation uses GPUs to speed up dataflow analysis (a core compiler technique for bug detection and optimization). By representing instructions as matrices, it achieves up to **250x speedup** over CPU-based versions, enabling faster static analysis for large codebases.
- **GPU-Based Instruction Scheduling**: A 2024 project parallelizes instruction scheduling (an NP-complete optimization phase) on GPUs using an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. Running on AMD GPUs with ROCm and LLVM, it delivers up to **27x faster scheduling**, **66% better occupancy**, and **21% overall compilation speedup** compared to standard LLVM schedulers, while reducing schedule length by 5.5%.

These efforts suggest potential for future hybrid CPU-GPU compilers, especially for compute-intensive optimizations, but they're not yet integrated into everyday tools. Parallel CPU compilation (e.g., via `make -j`) remains the standard for build speedups.
