The history of the World Trade Center is a story of ambitious urban renewal, groundbreaking architecture, and tragic loss, followed by a period of rebuilding and commemoration.

Here is an overview of the original complex and its successor:

## 🏛️ The Original World Trade Center (1966-2001)

### Conception and Design
* **The Vision:** The idea was first proposed in 1943, but the project gained momentum in the late 1950s. David Rockefeller (then-head of Chase Manhattan Bank) championed the project to stimulate urban renewal and economic growth in Lower Manhattan.
* **The Architect:** The complex was designed by Japanese-American architect **Minoru Yamasaki**, with Emery Roth & Sons as associate architects. Yamasaki's design, which featured the iconic narrow windows, was influenced by his desire to make occupants feel secure due to his own fear of heights.
* **The Towers:** The most prominent features were the 110-story **Twin Towers** (One and Two World Trade Center), which, upon completion, became the tallest buildings in the world. The overall complex included seven buildings.

### Construction and Operation
* **Groundbreaking:** Construction began on **August 5, 1966**. The site was built largely on landfill, requiring the use of an innovative perimeter slurry wall, known as "The Bathtub," to keep the Hudson River water out during excavation.
* **Completion:** The North Tower was topped out in 1970, and the South Tower in 1971. The complex was officially **dedicated on April 4, 1973**.
* **A Symbol:** The Twin Towers quickly became a globally recognized symbol of globalization, American economic power, and New York City. They housed a vast array of businesses, a hotel (3 WTC), and popular tourist attractions like the **"Windows on the World"** restaurant and the **South Tower Observation Deck**.

### Attacks and Destruction
* **1993 Bombing:** On February 26, 1993, a terrorist truck bomb was detonated in the public parking garage beneath the North Tower, killing six people and injuring over a thousand. The bombing caused extensive damage but did not topple the towers.
* **September 11, 2001:** Terrorists hijacked two commercial airliners and crashed them into the North and South Towers. The resulting fires and structural damage led to the complete collapse of both towers and 7 World Trade Center later that day, destroying the entire complex and killing 2,977 people.

## 🏗️ The New World Trade Center (2001-Present)

### Rebuilding and Commemoration
* **Ground Zero:** Following the attacks, the site became known as "Ground Zero," and a massive cleanup effort was undertaken.
* **Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC):** This organization was established to oversee the rebuilding and memorialization process.
* **Master Plan:** Architect Daniel Libeskind's master plan was ultimately chosen for the redevelopment, focusing on memory and rebuilding.

### The New Complex
The new complex includes:
* **The National September 11 Memorial & Museum:** Opened in 2011 and 2014, featuring two reflecting pools set in the footprints of the original Twin Towers, with the names of the victims inscribed around the edges.
* **One World Trade Center (1 WTC):** The centerpiece, often referred to as the Freedom Tower during its planning. It opened in **2014** and, at a symbolic height of **1,776 feet**, is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.
* **Other Towers:** The complex also includes 3 WTC, 4 WTC, and 7 WTC (the first to reopen in 2006), as well as the new World Trade Center Transportation Hub (The Oculus).

The new World Trade Center honors the past while serving as a dynamic, modern hub for business and transportation, fundamentally reshaping the Lower Manhattan skyline.
