title: Hanging a Lamp on the Shelf
translated: false
---


I wanted to reposition my lamp further back on the shelf to minimize distractions while reading.

Due to the complicated arrangement of items on my bed shelf, I decided to buy a hook from pinduoduo.com. It arrived after a few days, but after picking it up from the parcel station, I misplaced it somewhere in my home. This forced me to purchase the same product again.

Today, I suddenly thought of trying a different approach. I simply wrapped the wire into an X or U shape and inserted the twisted part into the hole. This way, the lamp stays attached to the shelf instead of falling down.

Basically, it achieved some balance there. The lamp wants to fall down due to gravity, so it pulls on the wire. However, the wire's upper part is stopped by the upper edge of the hole, so it can't be pulled out.

Then I tried to use a pencil to help with the wire, but the pencil slipped into the hole. When I looked inside carefully, I found there were things in the shelf. How did they get inside? Previously, I had found that the shelf was hard to open. Oh, actually, it can be opened.

So now the solution became simpler. Since I don't want the wire to prevent the shelf from closing, I used another hole to let the wire out.

This experience highlights the nuanced, context-aware problem-solving required in everyday situations, something I remain skeptical AI can fully replicate despite its rapid advancements.
