Below is a side-by-side comparison of **TV screens** (typically LED/LCD/OLED TVs) and **projectors** (home theater or portable models) across key factors. This focuses on modern consumer options as of late 2025.

| Aspect              | TV Screen (LED/OLED/QLED)                          | Projector (DLP/LCD/Laser)                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Picture Quality** | Excellent out-of-box: high brightness (500–2,000+ nits), native 4K/8K, HDR (Dolby Vision, HDR10+), wide color gamut. OLED offers perfect blacks and infinite contrast. | Good to excellent, but depends on ambient light and screen. Brightness 2,000–5,000+ lumens; laser models rival TVs in color/contrast. Native 4K common; 8K emerging. Blacks weaker without ALR screens. |
| **Screen Size**     | Fixed: 43" to 100"+ (85" common). Larger = expensive. | Flexible: 80" to 300"+ easily. Same projector scales with distance/screen. |
| **Brightness & Room Lighting** | Great in bright rooms; anti-glare coatings. | Struggles in daylight unless high-lumen laser + ALR screen. Best in dark/dim rooms. |
| **Contrast & Black Levels** | OLED: perfect blacks. LED: good (mini-LED improves). | Weaker native blacks; requires dark room or UST + ALR screen for decent contrast. |
| **Input Lag / Gaming** | 1–10 ms (120–144 Hz, VRR, ALLM). Ideal for gaming. | 15–50 ms (some 4K@120 Hz models ~16 ms). Improving but TVs lead. |
| **Installation**   | Wall mount or stand. Plug-and-play. | Ceiling mount, screen, wiring. Portable models easier but need dark space. |
| **Cost (approx.)**  | $500 (55" 4K LED) to $2,500 (77" OLED). Per inch: ~$15–$40. | $800 (1080p portable) to $3,000 (4K laser). 100" setup ~$1,500–$4,000. Per inch: ~$5–$15. |
| **Lifespan**        | 50,000–100,000 hours (OLED burn-in risk if static). | Lamp: 2,000–5,000 hrs ($200–$400 replace). Laser/LED: 20,000–30,000 hrs. |
| **Audio**           | Built-in speakers (20–70W). Soundbars common. | Rarely included; needs external speakers/soundbar. |
| **Portability**     | Heavy, fixed. | Portable models <5 lbs; easy to move. |
| **Power Consumption** | 80–300W (size-dependent). | 150–400W (lamp models higher). |
| **Smart Features**  | Built-in (Roku, webOS, Google TV, etc.). | Often Android TV; some need external streamer. |
| **Best For**        | Bright living rooms, gaming, daily use, no setup hassle. | Cinema-like experience, large screens, dedicated dark rooms, budget big-screen. |

### Quick Verdict
- **Choose a TV** if: You want hassle-free setup, bright-room viewing, low input lag for gaming, or all-in-one smart features.
- **Choose a Projector** if: You crave 100"+ screens on a budget, have a dark/dedicated room, and don’t mind external audio + occasional maintenance (lamp models).

**Hybrid Option**: Ultra-Short-Throw (UST) laser projectors (e.g., Hisense L9H, Formovie Theater) with ALR screens act like "100-inch TVs" with better blacks/brightness—best of both worlds, but $2,500–$4,000.
