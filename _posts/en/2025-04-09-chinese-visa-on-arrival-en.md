### Notes on Specific Examples You Mentioned
- **Thailand**: As noted, Chinese citizens enjoy 30 days visa-free entry, extendable up to 90 days within a 180-day period under a mutual agreement. No form is needed upon arrival—just a valid passport.
- **Singapore**: A 30-day visa-free stay is available due to a mutual exemption agreement. Entry is straightforward with no additional forms required at the border.

### Additional Context
- **Total Access**: As of 2025, Chinese citizens can access approximately 85-99 countries and territories visa-free or with a visa on arrival, depending on how specific policies are counted (e.g., Henley Passport Index lists 85, while other sources like VisaGuide estimate up to 99 with recent updates).
- **Recent Developments**: China has been expanding visa-free access, notably with countries like Thailand, Singapore, and several European nations (though many European agreements are for their citizens entering China, not vice versa). Bilateral agreements and unilateral policies continue to evolve, so this list may grow by year-end.
- **Conditions**: Visa-free or on-arrival stays typically require a passport valid for at least six months, return tickets, and proof of accommodation or funds. Some countries may have additional entry conditions (e.g., Lebanon’s conditional visa on arrival).

For the most current and detailed information, especially for visa-on-arrival processes or last-minute policy changes, check with the embassies or immigration websites of the destination countries. Policies can shift, particularly as China negotiates new travel agreements throughout 2025. Safe travels!
