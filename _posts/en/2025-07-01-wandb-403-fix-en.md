title: Fixing W&B 403 Permission Denied
translated: false
type: note
---

The error message "permission denied" (HTTP 403) from Weights & Biases (wandb) indicates that your current user `lzwjava (lzwjava-teksystems)` does not have the necessary permissions to create or upload a run to the specified project.

Here's how to fix it, along with a breakdown of potential causes:

**Understanding the Problem:**

  * **Authentication vs. Authorization:** You are *authenticated* (successfully logged in as `lzwjava (lzwjava-teksystems)`), but you are not *authorized* to perform the action (upload a run to `my-awesome-team-name/my-awesome-project`).
  * **Common Causes for Permission Denied (403):**
      * **Incorrect Team/Entity Name:** The `entity` specified in `wandb.init()` might not match the team you intend to log to, or you might not be a member of that team.
      * **Incorrect Project Name:** The `project` specified might not exist within the `entity`, or you might not have write access to it.
      * **Insufficient Role:** Your user role within the `my-awesome-team-name` team might not have the necessary permissions to create new runs or upload data.
      * **API Key Issues:** Although less likely given you're "logged in," a corrupted or revoked API key could also lead to permission issues.

**How to Fix It:**

1.  **Verify `entity` and `project` in `wandb.init()`:**

      * **Double-check the `entity`:** In your `wandb.init()` call, you have `entity="my-awesome-team-name"`. Make sure this exact string matches the team name on your Weights & Biases dashboard. Go to `https://wandb.ai/` and check your team names.
      * **Double-check the `project`:** Similarly, ensure `project="my-awesome-project"` is the correct project name within that team.
      * **Correct the `wandb.init()` call:** If they are incorrect, update your Python script (`wandbrun.py`) with the correct `entity` and `project` names.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    import wandb

    run = wandb.init(
        # Set the wandb entity where your project will be logged (generally your team name).
        entity="your_actual_team_name", # <--- IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual team name
        # Set the wandb project where your runs will be logged.
        project="your_actual_project_name", # <--- IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual project name
        config={
            "learning_rate": 0.01,
            "epochs": 10,
            "batch_size": 32,
        },
    )
    ```

2.  **Check Your Team Membership and Role on WandB:**

      * Go to your Weights & Biases dashboard (`https://wandb.ai/`).
      * Navigate to the team (`my-awesome-team-name` or your correct team name).
      * Look for "Members" or "Team Settings" and verify that your user `lzwjava` is listed and has a role that allows run creation/upload (e.g., "Member", "Admin"). If you're a "Viewer" or have a very restricted role, you won't be able to upload runs.
      * **If you don't have the right role:** Contact your team's administrator on Weights & Biases and request the appropriate permissions.

3.  **Log Out and Relogin (Force Relogin):**

      * While you are "logged in," sometimes cached credentials or tokens can become stale or corrupted. Forcing a relogin can refresh them.
      * Open your terminal and run:
        ```bash
        wandb login --relogin
        ```
      * This will prompt you to enter your API key. You can find your API key on your Weights & Biases profile page (`https://wandb.ai/authorize`).

4.  **Verify API Key (Less Likely, but Good to Check):**

      * Ensure the API key associated with your `lzwjava` account is valid and active.
      * You can regenerate your API key from your Weights & Biases profile settings. If you regenerate it, you'll need to use `wandb login --relogin` again with the new key.

5.  **Create the Project Manually (If it doesn't exist):**

      * Although `wandb.init()` usually creates a project if it doesn't exist within the specified entity, a permission issue could prevent this.
      * You can try creating the `my-awesome-project` project manually on the Weights & Biases website under `my-awesome-team-name` to ensure it exists and you have permissions for it.

**In summary, the most common culprit for a 403 permission error with wandb is an incorrect `entity` or `project` name in your `wandb.init()` call, or insufficient user permissions within the specified team/project on the Weights & Biases platform.** Start by carefully checking those first.
