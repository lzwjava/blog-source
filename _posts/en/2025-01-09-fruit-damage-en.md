title: Avoiding Damage When Ordering Fruits
translated: false
---

Transporting fruits over long distances can be challenging. Here are some takeaways on how to avoid receiving broken fruit.

Purple grapes or green grapes are easily damaged during the journey. Once a grape becomes broken, it starts to decay, affecting other nearby grapes.

Fragrant Pears are great. They are a sweet and aromatic pear variety from Xinjiang, China, and are also called Xinjiang Pears. I just learned this. When they arrived at home, each one was intact.

Muskmelons are good too. However, during my last delivery, one of my two muskmelons was broken. Probably because it was too large, the delivery drivers assumed it wouldn't break easily and handled it poorly. This might explain why smaller pears or grapes are often better protected.

Autumn Moon Pears are okay as well. They can be categorized with pears, so they are quite similar to Fragrant Pears.

Longan, kiwifruit, and pineapples are also safe. Their surfaces are hard, so they are not easy to break or decay.

As the examples above show, we need to consider both the nature of the fruit itself, its vulnerability to decay, and how easily its peel can break. We should also think about how the delivery drivers handle it. Sometimes, larger fruits are treated poorly, which is counterintuitive. I might be wrong about this, and I should probably try ordering more times to confirm.

Durians are a type of fresh produce. They need to be cooked in a microwave oven or electric oven for 5 to 10 minutes.
