Yes, that's correct — and it depends on how the organization has configured its security settings.

When you use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** (classic or fine-grained) with GitHub, the behavior for organization repositories is usually as follows:

| Scenario | Can your PAT access org repos without extra steps? | What happens / what you need |
| --- | --- | --- |
| You are a member of the organization and the org allows it | Sometimes yes | Many organizations set **"Third-party access"** to **"Allow"** or **"Restrict"**. If set to **Allow**, your PAT works immediately for repos you already have access to. |
| Organization has **restricted third-party access** (very common in enterprises) | No | Even if you are a member and have direct access to the repo in the web UI, GitHub blocks your PAT and shows an error like: <br>`ERROR: Permission to org/repo.git denied to user. Organization requires approval for access using personal access tokens.` |
| You have never used a PAT for that org before (even if third-party access is allowed) | Usually no the first time | GitHub forces a one-time approval flow: you must visit `https://github.com/settings/tokens` (or a direct link GitHub provides in the error) and explicitly **request access** for that token to the organization. An org admin then approves (or denies) it. |
| You are using a **fine-grained PAT** (the newer type) | Almost always requires explicit approval | Fine-grained tokens have a separate approval flow per organization, even if you own the token. |

### Summary of what you typically experience in Enterprise/strict orgs

1. Personal repositories → PAT works immediately.
2. Organization repositories → First time you try to git clone/push/pull with a PAT, you get an error and a link like  
   `https://github.com/settings/tokens/XXXX/request-org-access`
3. You click the link → request access for that specific token to the organization.
4. An organization owner/admin approves (usually takes seconds to a few hours).
5. After approval, the same PAT works forever for that org (until revoked or expired).

### How to avoid the approval step entirely

- Use **GitHub App installations** or **installable GitHub Actions tokens** (recommended for CI/CD).
- Use an **SSH key** (SSH keys are never subject to the PAT third-party restriction policy).
- Ask your org admins to relax the “Third-party application access policy” (many enterprises won’t do this).

So yes — for most real enterprise organizations in 2024–2025, you are absolutely right: personal projects = instant access, organization projects = you have to request (and get approved) access for each personal access token you want to use.
