Traveling from Guangzhou, China, to Europe for 10 days on a minimal budget requires careful planning, focusing on affordable transportation, accommodation, food, and activities. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:

---

### 1. Flights: Finding the Cheapest Options
- **Cost Estimate:** $400–$650 round-trip (depending on deals and flexibility).
- **Tips:**
  - **Book Early:** Search for flights 2–3 months in advance. Prices from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (CAN) to Europe are lowest in off-peak seasons like late fall (October–November) or early spring (February–March), avoiding holidays like Chinese New Year.
  - **Use Flight Search Tools:** Websites like Skyscanner, Kayak, or Trip.com can help you find deals. Look for flights to budget-friendly European hubs like Frankfurt, Amsterdam, or Istanbul, which often have cheaper connections from China.
  - **Flexible Dates:** Be open to flying midweek (Tuesday or Wednesday) for lower fares.
  - **Layovers:** Opt for flights with longer layovers (e.g., via Middle Eastern hubs like Dubai or Doha) to save money. For example, China Southern Airlines or Turkish Airlines often offer competitive rates from Guangzhou.
  - **Example:** A round-trip ticket to Frankfurt might cost ~$450 if booked early, with a return from another city like Paris for flexibility.

### 2. Visa: Schengen Visa
- **Cost:** ~$85 (80 EUR) for a Schengen visa, which covers 26 European countries.
- **Tips:**
  - Apply through the nearest European consulate in Guangzhou (e.g., German, French, or Italian consulate, depending on your main entry point).
  - Prepare documents (passport, flight itinerary, accommodation proof, bank statements) well in advance to avoid rush fees.
  - Processing takes 15–30 days, so plan ahead.

### 3. Transportation in Europe: Budget Options
- **Cost Estimate:** $50–$100 for 10 days.
- **Tips:**
  - **Trains and Buses:** Use budget operators like FlixBus or BlaBlaCar for intercity travel. A bus from Paris to Amsterdam can be as low as $15 if booked early.
  - **Rail Passes:** Consider a Eurail Pass (e.g., 5 days in 1 month, ~$200), but only if you’ll travel between multiple countries. Otherwise, point-to-point tickets on budget lines are cheaper.
  - **Flights:** Low-cost airlines like Ryanair or Wizz Air offer intra-Europe flights for $20–$50 if booked in advance with no checked luggage.
  - **City Transport:** Stick to walking or buy daily public transport passes (e.g., ~$5/day in Berlin or Paris).
  - **Strategy:** Focus on a compact region (e.g., Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France) to minimize travel costs.

### 4. Accommodation: Low-Cost Stays
- **Cost Estimate:** $15–$30/night, or $150–$300 total.
- **Tips:**
  - **Hostels:** Book dorm beds via Hostelworld or Booking.com in cities like Amsterdam, Berlin, or Prague (~$15–$25/night).
  - **Budget Hotels:** Look for deals on platforms like Agoda or Airbnb for private rooms (~$25–$30/night).
  - **Couchsurfing:** Free stays with locals if you’re comfortable with it—just contribute a small gift or meal.
  - **Location:** Stay slightly outside city centers (e.g., Montmartre in Paris or Kreuzberg in Berlin) for cheaper rates with good transport links.

### 5. Food: Eating on a Budget
- **Cost Estimate:** $10–$15/day, or $100–$150 total.
- **Tips:**
  - **Street Food & Markets:** Grab cheap eats like falafel in Berlin (~$4), crepes in Paris (~$5), or sausages in Prague (~$3).
  - **Supermarkets:** Buy bread, cheese, and fruit from stores like Lidl or Aldi for picnics (~$5/day).
  - **Avoid Restaurants:** If you dine out, choose local eateries over tourist traps (e.g., pasta in Italy for ~$8).
  - **Water:** Refill a bottle at public fountains instead of buying drinks.

---

### 6. Activities: Free and Low-Cost Sightseeing
- **Cost Estimate:** $0–$50 total.
- **Tips:**
  - **Free Attractions:** Explore parks (e.g., Vondelpark in Amsterdam), historic streets (e.g., Prague’s Old Town), or iconic landmarks (e.g., Eiffel Tower from afar).
  - **Museums:** Many offer free entry on specific days (e.g., first Sunday of the month in Paris) or cost ~$10 otherwise.
  - **Walking Tours:** Join “free” tours (tip-based, ~$5–$10) in cities like Budapest or Lisbon.
  - **Limit Paid Sites:** Pick 1–2 must-see attractions (e.g., Louvre ~$18) and skip the rest.
