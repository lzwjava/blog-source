Not necessarily — it depends on exactly which “Hong Kong version” (model, ROM, region) you mean, and what terms you mean by “has Gemini, Google, eSIM, AI writing/translation.” Below is what I found. (If you tell me the exact Xiaomi model you have, I can check more precisely.)

### What *is* known / planned

* Xiaomi has announced that for “overseas markets” (i.e. non-mainland China) its next flagship phones will integrate Google’s **Gemini** AI model. ([South China Morning Post][1])
* Xiaomi’s HyperAI branding describes AI features like “AI Writing” (help with essays, emails, etc.), system-wide AI assistance (text, sound, image) in its OS. ([Xiaomi][2])
* Xiaomi’s support pages say that some Xiaomi phones support eSIM, subject to carrier and region. ([Xiaomi][3])

So Xiaomi *intends* for its international / non-China models to have these AI / Gemini / eSIM / Google abilities.

### What’s uncertain / what depends on the version

* If a Xiaomi phone is the “China ROM / China version,” it often **does not include Google Mobile Services (GMS)** by default (because in mainland China Google is restricted). This means things like Google Play Store, Google Maps, etc., may be missing. ([Wikipedia][4])
* eSIM support is region- and hardware-dependent. Some Xiaomi phones in China / Hong Kong markets might not include eSIM, or the eSIM functionality may be disabled. ([Klook Travel][5])
* Even if the hardware supports eSIM, carriers and firmware may block or limit it. ([Klook Travel][5])
* Just because “Gemini integration” is announced doesn’t guarantee *your specific unit* has full Gemini access (voice, live conversation, full model) — rollout may be phased or region-restricted.

### My verdict (based on what you asked)

If by “Xiaomi Hong Kong version” you mean a **global / international model sold in Hong Kong (not a China-ROM locked unit)**, then yes, it is *likely* or *intended* to have:

* Gemini / AI integration for writing, translation, etc.
* Google services (Play Store, Maps, etc.)
* eSIM (if supported by the hardware and carrier)

But I cannot guarantee *every* HK Xiaomi unit will have all those features — some may lack eSIM, or have limited AI access depending on firmware or region settings.

If you tell me your exact Xiaomi model (e.g. “Xiaomi 14 Hong Kong version”) I can check whether *your phone* supports all those features. Do you want me to check for your model?
