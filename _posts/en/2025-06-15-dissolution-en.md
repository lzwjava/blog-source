title: Egg Tart Sugar Dissolution

When making an egg tart or any custard-based mixture, the process of dissolving sugar can sometimes take longer than expected due to several factors. Here are a few reasons why the sugar might not be dissolving completely after 20 minutes:

Temperature: Sugar dissolves more readily in warmer liquids. If your mixture is not warm enough, the sugar may take longer to dissolve. Try warming the mixture gently while stirring.

Stirring: Insufficient stirring can lead to sugar settling at the bottom. Make sure you are stirring the mixture consistently and thoroughly.

Particle Size: If you're using coarse sugar, it may take longer to dissolve compared to fine or caster sugar. Using finer sugar can help it dissolve more quickly.

Saturation: If you've added a large amount of sugar relative to the liquid, the solution might be approaching saturation, making it harder for additional sugar to dissolve. Ensure you are using the correct proportions as per your recipe.

Order of Mixing: Sometimes the order in which ingredients are mixed can affect how well they combine. For instance, mixing sugar with the milk before adding the egg might help the sugar dissolve more evenly.

Type of Sugar: Different types of sugar (e.g., granulated, brown sugar) have different dissolution rates. Brown sugar, for example, may take longer to dissolve due to its molasses content.

To address the issue, you can try gently heating the mixture while stirring continuously. This should help the sugar dissolve more effectively. If the mixture gets too hot, make sure to let it cool to an appropriate temperature before adding eggs to avoid cooking them prematurely.
