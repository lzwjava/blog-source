It seems like you're trying to retrieve the proxy configuration from npm using `npm config get proxy`, but you're encountering an error indicating that the proxy setting is protected or inaccessible in a standard way. This could happen due to how npm handles sensitive configuration data or due to restrictions in your environment.

Here’s how you can troubleshoot and resolve this:

1. **Check npm Configuration Manually**  
   Instead of relying solely on `npm config get proxy`, you can inspect the full npm configuration to see if the proxy is set. Run:
   ```
   npm config list
   ```
   This will display all configuration settings, including `proxy` and `https-proxy` if they’re defined. Look for lines like:
   ```
   proxy = "http://username:password@proxy-server:port"
   https-proxy = "http://username:password@proxy-server:port"
   ```

2. **Locate the npm Config File**  
   npm stores its configuration in a `.npmrc` file. You can check where it’s located by running:
   ```
   npm config get userconfig
   ```
   This typically points to `~/.npmrc` (on Unix-like systems) or `%USERPROFILE%\.npmrc` (on Windows). Open that file in a text editor to see if the proxy is explicitly set there. It might look like:
   ```
   proxy=http://username:password@proxy-server:port
   https-proxy=http://username:password@proxy-server:port
   ```

3. **Sensitive Data Protection**  
   If the proxy settings include sensitive information (like a username or password), npm might restrict direct access to prevent accidental exposure. Try running the command with elevated privileges (if applicable) or check if your environment variables are overriding the settings:
   ```
   echo $http_proxy  # On Unix-like systems
   echo %HTTP_PROXY%  # On Windows
   ```

4. **Set or Update Proxy Settings**  
   If you’re trying to confirm the proxy because it’s not working, you might need to set or update it manually. Use:
   ```
   npm config set proxy http://username:password@proxy-server:port
   npm config set https-proxy http://username:password@proxy-server:port
   ```
   Then verify with `npm config list`.

5. **Error Context**  
   If the error persists, could you share the exact error message npm returns? That would help narrow down whether this is a permissions issue, a syntax problem, or something else.
