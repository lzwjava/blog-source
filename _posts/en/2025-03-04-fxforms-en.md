It looks like you're referring to integrating the `FXForms` library into an iOS project using CocoaPods, a popular dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C projects. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you use `pod 'FXForms', '1.2.13'` in your project:

---

### Prerequisites
1. **Install CocoaPods**: If you don’t have CocoaPods installed on your machine, install it first by running this command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   ```
2. **Xcode Project**: Ensure you have an existing Xcode project where you want to integrate `FXForms`.

### Steps to Use `pod 'FXForms', '1.2.13'`

#### 1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**
Open your terminal and change to the directory containing your Xcode project (`.xcodeproj` file):
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

#### 2. **Initialize a Podfile (if not already present)**
If you don’t already have a `Podfile` in your project directory, create one by running:
```bash
pod init
```
This will generate a `Podfile` in your project directory.

#### 3. **Edit the Podfile**
Open the `Podfile` in a text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, or any code editor like VS Code) and add the `FXForms` pod with the specific version `1.2.13`. Your `Podfile` should look something like this:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'  # Specify the minimum iOS version (adjust as needed)
use_frameworks!       # Optional, include if you're using Swift or frameworks

target 'YourProjectName' do
  # Pods for YourProjectName
  pod 'FXForms', '1.2.13'
end
```

- Replace `'YourProjectName'` with the actual name of your Xcode target (you can find this in Xcode under your project settings).
- The line `pod 'FXForms', '1.2.13'` specifies that you want version `1.2.13` of the `FXForms` library.

#### 4. **Install the Pod**
Save the `Podfile`, then run the following command in your terminal to install the specified version of `FXForms`:
```bash
pod install
```
This will download and integrate `FXForms` version `1.2.13` into your project. If successful, you’ll see output indicating the pods have been installed.

#### 5. **Open the Workspace**
After running `pod install`, a `.xcworkspace` file will be created in your project directory. Open this file (not the `.xcodeproj`) in Xcode:
```bash
open YourProjectName.xcworkspace
```

#### 6. **Use FXForms in Your Code**
`FXForms` is an Objective-C library that simplifies creating forms in iOS apps. Here’s a basic example of how to use it:

- **Import FXForms**: In your Objective-C file (e.g., a view controller), import the library:
  ```objective-c
  #import <FXForms/FXForms.h>
  ```

- **Create a Form Model**: Define a class that conforms to the `FXForm` protocol. For example:
  ```objective-c
  // MyForm.h
  #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
  #import <FXForms/FXForms.h>

  @interface MyForm : NSObject <FXForm>
  @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *name;
  @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *email;
  @end

  // MyForm.m
  #import "MyForm.h"

  @implementation MyForm
  - (NSArray *)fields {
      return @[
          @{FXFormFieldKey: @"name", FXFormFieldTitle: @"Name"},
          @{FXFormFieldKey: @"email", FXFormFieldTitle: @"Email"}
      ];
  }
  @end
  ```

- **Display the Form**: In your view controller, present the form using `FXFormViewController`:
  ```objective-c
  #import "MyForm.h"

  - (void)viewDidLoad {
      [super viewDidLoad];
      FXFormViewController *formController = [[FXFormViewController alloc] init];
      formController.form = [[MyForm alloc] init];
      [self.navigationController pushViewController:formController animated:YES];
  }
  ```

#### 7. **Build and Run**
Build your project in Xcode (`Cmd + B`) to ensure everything is set up correctly, then run it on a simulator or device (`Cmd + R`).

### Troubleshooting
- **Pod Not Found**: If you get an error like "Unable to find a specification for `FXForms`," ensure the library is still available in the CocoaPods repository. As of my last update, `FXForms` is an older library, and its availability might depend on the CocoaPods trunk.
- **Version Error**: If version `1.2.13` isn’t available, you can check available versions by running:
  ```bash
  pod search FXForms
  ```
  Then update the version in your `Podfile` accordingly.
- **Build Errors**: Ensure your deployment target in Xcode matches or exceeds the minimum iOS version required by `FXForms` (typically iOS 7.0+ for older versions).

---

### Additional Notes
- **`FXForms` Overview**: `FXForms` is a library by Nick Lockwood that automates form creation in iOS. It’s particularly useful for generating table-view-based forms with minimal code.
- **Swift Projects**: If you’re using Swift, you’ll need to create an Objective-C bridging header to use `FXForms`, as it’s an Objective-C library. Add `#import <FXForms/FXForms.h>` to the header.
