Matthias Felleisen is a German-American computer science professor and author, recognized for his significant contributions to the field of programming languages and computer science education.

He received his Ph.D. from Indiana University Bloomington and later served as a professor at Rice University for 14 years before joining the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University as a Trustee Professor.

Felleisen's interests broadly encompass programming languages, including programming tools, program design, and software contracts. He is particularly noted for his work on:
* **Operational semantics**: A way to formally define the meaning of programming language constructs.
* **Type safety and gradual typing**: Concepts related to ensuring programs behave correctly with respect to data types, even when different typing approaches are mixed.
* **Continuations and A-normal form**: Advanced concepts in functional programming that deal with control flow and program structure.

A major aspect of his career has been his dedication to computer science education. In the 1990s, he launched PLT and the TeachScheme! project (later ProgramByDesign and Bootstrap project), aiming to teach program-design principles to beginners and explore using Scheme for large systems. This initiative led to the co-authorship of influential textbooks like "How to Design Programs" (2001, 2nd ed. 2018), which takes a distinctive approach to teaching introductory computer science. He has also co-authored "The Little Schemer," "The Seasoned Schemer," "Realm of Racket," and "Semantics Engineering with PLT Redex," among others.

Felleisen has received numerous accolades for his work, including being inducted as an ACM Fellow in 2006, receiving the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award in 2009, the SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education in 2010, and the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Achievement Award in 2012 for his significant and lasting contributions to the field.
