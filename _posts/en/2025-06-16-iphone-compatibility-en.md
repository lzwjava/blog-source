translated: false
type: note
---

Using a second-hand iPhone 4 or iPhone 6 in 2025 comes with significant limitations due to their outdated hardware and lack of iOS updates. Below, I’ll outline the compatibility of apps and software for each device, focusing on what works, what doesn’t, and why, based on their last supported iOS versions and hardware constraints.

### iPhone 4
- **Last Supported iOS**: iOS 7.1.2 (released 2013)[](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/how-obsolete-is-the-iphone-4-in-2024.3296508/)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4)
- **Hardware**: A4 chip, 512 MB RAM, 3.5-inch Retina display, 5 MP rear camera, no front-facing camera on some models.
- **General Limitations**: The iPhone 4 is severely outdated in 2025. Most modern apps require iOS versions far beyond 7.1.2, and the A4 chip with 512 MB RAM struggles with performance. Additionally, carriers no longer support activation for devices without VoLTE, meaning the iPhone 4 cannot function as a phone for calls or texts in most regions. It’s essentially a music player or basic device for offline tasks.[](https://help.backmarket.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404163930002-iOS-and-iPhone-compatibility-guide-2024)[](https://help.backmarket.com/hc/en-ie/articles/4404163930002-iOS-and-iPhone-compatibility-guide-2024)

#### Apps/Software That Likely Work
1. **System Apps (Pre-installed)**:
   - **Calculator, Clock, Calendar**: These basic apps function fine as they don’t rely on internet connectivity or modern APIs. They’re built into iOS 7 and work offline.
   - **Camera**: The 5 MP rear camera (and 0.3 MP front camera on iPhone 4S) can take photos and record 720p video. The quality is decent for casual use but lacks modern features like Night Mode or Deep Fusion. The camera app works without issues for basic photography.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4)
   - **Notes, Contacts, Reminders**: These apps work for local storage and basic management but won’t sync with modern iCloud features due to outdated protocols.
   - **Safari**: Basic web browsing is possible, but many modern websites using advanced JavaScript or CSS will break or load poorly due to the outdated browser engine in iOS 7.[](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/how-obsolete-is-the-iphone-4-in-2024.3296508/)
   - **Music, Podcasts**: The Music app can play locally stored music. Apple Podcasts may work for older content, but streaming or downloading new podcasts is likely broken due to server-side changes.[](https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=603968)
   - **Photos**: The Photos app can manage and display locally stored images but lacks modern editing features or iCloud integration.

2. **Third-Party Apps**:
   - Most third-party apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube) are incompatible because they require iOS 12 or later, and developers have updated their apps to use newer APIs. Even older versions of these apps, if you can find them, may fail due to server-side changes (e.g., WhatsApp login issues).[](https://www.envirofone.com/en-gb/buy/advice-centre/ios-app-compatibility)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyJailbreak/comments/1iung0i/how_to_use_iphone_4_in_2025/)
   - **Cydia (Jailbroken Devices)**: If the iPhone 4 is jailbroken, some tweaks from Cydia may allow limited functionality, like installing older app versions or applying iOS 7 themes. However, this is risky due to unpatched security vulnerabilities.[](https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=603968)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyJailbreak/comments/1iung0i/how_to_use_iphone_4_in_2025/)
   - Lightweight apps like Geekbench 2 or AnTuTu Benchmark (older versions) may still run for performance testing.[](https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=603968)

#### Apps/Software Likely to Have Issues

- **FaceTime, iMessage**: FaceTime often fails due to compatibility issues with newer iOS devices, showing errors like “person not available.” iMessage may work for basic messaging but can send duplicate messages or fail to sync properly.[](https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=603968)
- **App Store**: The App Store is largely unusable, as most apps require iOS 12 or higher. Downloading older app versions is difficult without jailbreaking, and even then, server-side authentication often fails.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyJailbreak/comments/1iung0i/how_to_use_iphone_4_in_2025/)
- **Modern Apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Instagram, Banking Apps)**: These require iOS 12 or later and won’t run. Even if older versions are sideloaded, server-side changes prevent login or functionality.[](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/how-obsolete-is-the-iphone-4-in-2024.3296508/)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyJailbreak/comments/1iung0i/how_to_use_iphone_4_in_2025/)
- **Web-Based Services**: Streaming services like Netflix or Spotify fail to log in due to outdated security protocols or app versions no longer supported by servers.[](https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=603968)
- **Security Risks**: iOS 7 has unpatched vulnerabilities, making the device risky for online use, especially for sensitive tasks like email or banking.[](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/how-obsolete-is-the-iphone-4-in-2024.3296508/)

#### Summary for iPhone 4
The iPhone 4 is barely usable in 2025. It’s limited to basic offline tasks (calculator, clock, camera, local music playback). Most online services, including Maps, social media, and messaging apps, are broken due to outdated APIs, server-side changes, and lack of VoLTE support. Battery degradation is also a concern unless recently replaced. It’s best suited as a nostalgic device or paperweight, not a daily driver.[](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/how-obsolete-is-the-iphone-4-in-2024.3296508/)

### iPhone 6
- **Last Supported iOS**: iOS 12.5.7 (released 2023)[](https://blog.aricius.com/can-you-still-use-an-iphone-6-in-2025-everything-you-need-to-know/)[](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255986763)
- **Hardware**: A8 chip, 1 GB RAM, 4.7-inch Retina display, 8 MP rear camera, 1.2 MP front camera.
- **General Limitations**: The iPhone 6 stopped receiving major iOS updates after iOS 12, missing out on features like Apple Intelligence and modern security patches.

   - **Music, Podcasts**: The Music app plays locally stored music without issues. Older versions of Apple Podcasts may work for accessing cached content, but new downloads or streaming are hit-or-miss due to server changes.
   - **Photos**: The Photos app manages local images and supports basic editing, though it lacks modern AI-driven features.
   - **Mail**: Basic email functionality (e.g., Outlook) may work, but some providers like Gmail may have issues due to outdated security protocols.[](https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=603968)

2. **Third-Party Apps**:
   - Some older versions of apps compatible with iOS 12 may still work if previously downloaded, such as lightweight productivity apps or games. For example, older versions of WhatsApp or Instagram might function, but login issues are common due to server-side updates.[](https://blog.aricius.com/can-you-still-use-an-iphone-6-in-2025-everything-you-need-to-know/)
   - Apps like Geekbench or AnTuTu Benchmark (older versions) can run for performance testing.[](https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=603968)
   - Jailbreaking could allow sideloading of older app versions, but this is risky and not guaranteed to work due to server authentication issues.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyJailbreak/comments/1iung0i/how_to_use_iphone_4_in_2025/)

#### Apps/Software Likely to Have Issues
- **Maps**: Apple Maps on iOS 12 is functional for basic navigation but lacks real-time traffic, AR features, and updated map data. Third-party map apps like Google Maps require newer iOS versions, making them incompatible.[](https://blog.aricius.com/can-you-still-use-an-iphone-6-in-2025-everything-you-need-to-know/)
- **FaceTime, iMessage**: These may work for basic messaging with other Apple devices, but compatibility with newer iOS versions can cause issues (e.g., failed connections or missing features like live translation).[](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/06/09/what-iphones-and-ipads-will-run-ios-26-ipados-26)
- **App Store**: Many modern apps require iOS 13 or later, limiting what can be downloaded.

#### Summary for iPhone 6
The iPhone 6 is marginally more usable than the iPhone 4 in 2025 but still heavily limited. It can handle basic offline tasks (calculator, clock, camera, local music) and some web browsing, but most modern apps and services (Maps, social media, streaming) are either incompatible or unreliable due to iOS 12’s limitations and lack of VoLTE support. Battery replacement (costing $40-$80) may improve usability, but the device is not future-proof.[](https://blog.aricius.com/can-you-still-use-an-iphone-6-in-2025-everything-you-need-to-know/)

### General Notes for Both Devices
- **Battery Health**: Both models likely have degraded batteries (below 80% capacity) unless recently replaced. Check battery health or opt for a replacement to ensure usability.[](https://www.xtracover.com/blog/is-buying-a-second-hand-iphone-in-2025-still-worth-it/)[](https://blog.aricius.com/can-you-still-use-an-iphone-6-in-2025-everything-you-need-to-know/)
- **Network Limitations**: Neither device supports VoLTE, so they cannot be used as phones on most modern networks (e.g., AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon), limiting them to Wi-Fi-only tasks.[](https://help.backmarket.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404163930002-iOS-and-iPhone-compatibility-guide-2024)[](https://blog.aricius.com/can-you-still-use-an-iphone-6-in-2025-everything-you-need-to-know/)
- **Security Concerns**: Without security updates, both are vulnerable to exploits, making them risky for sensitive tasks (e.g., banking, email).[](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/how-obsolete-is-the-iphone-4-in-2024.3296508/)[](https://www.wawcase.com/apple-ios-version-support/)
- **Jailbreaking**: Jailbreaking may allow some workarounds (e.g., sideloading older apps), but it’s complex, risky, and often fails due to server-side changes.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyJailbreak/comments/1iung0i/how_to_use_iphone_4_in_2025/)
- **Recommendation**: For better app compatibility and security, consider upgrading to a second-hand iPhone 11 or newer, which supports iOS 26 in 2025. These models offer modern features, 5G, and ongoing software support.[](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/ios-26-compatible-iphones-rumor/)[](https://uptradeit.com/blog/what-iphones-will-stop-working)

### Conclusion
- **iPhone 4**: Best for offline tasks like calculator, clock, camera, and local music playback. Most online apps (Maps, social media, streaming) are broken due to iOS 7’s age and server-side changes. It’s not viable as a phone.
- **iPhone 6**: Slightly better, supporting basic offline apps (calculator, clock, camera) and limited web browsing. Maps and modern apps are largely unusable due to iOS 12 limitations and lack of VoLTE. It’s also not viable as a phone.
- For both, expect a nostalgic but frustrating experience. If you need a functional device, a second-hand iPhone SE (2022) or iPhone 11 offers far better value and compatibility in 2025.[](https://blog.thebigphonestore.co.uk/best-second-hand-iphone-to-buy-in-2025/)[](https://usedmobiles4u.co.uk/the-best-second-hand-iphones-for-speed-in-2025/)

You’re right to point out the potential confusion regarding the Music app on the iPhone 4, and I appreciate the chance to clarify. Let’s address this specifically for the iPhone 4 running iOS 7.1.2 in 2025, focusing on the music functionality and the iTunes-to-Music app transition.

### Clarification on Music App for iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1.2)
- **iOS 7 and the Music App**: On iOS 7.1.2 (the last supported version for the iPhone 4), the built-in app for playing music is indeed called the **Music app**, not iTunes. The iTunes app on iOS 7 was used for accessing the iTunes Store to purchase or download content, while the Music app was the dedicated player for locally stored music files (e.g., MP3s or songs synced via iTunes on a computer). Apple’s rebranding of iTunes to Apple Music occurred later, starting with iOS 8.4 in 2015, which introduced the Apple Music streaming service. Since the iPhone 4 cannot update to iOS 8 or later, it does not have the modern Apple Music app or streaming capabilities.
- **Functionality in 2025**: The Music app on iOS 7.1.2 still works for **playing locally stored music** that was synced to the device via iTunes on a computer. You can connect the iPhone 4 to a computer running an older version of iTunes (e.g., iTunes 12.7 or earlier, compatible with iOS 7), sync music files, and play them through the Music app. The app supports playlists, albums, artists, and basic playback controls.
- **Limitations**:
  - **No Streaming**: The iPhone 4 cannot access Apple Music or other streaming services (e.g., Spotify) because these require newer iOS versions (typically iOS 12 or later) and modern APIs. Even older versions of streaming apps, if sideloaded, are likely to fail due to server-side authentication changes.
  - **iTunes Store Access**: The iTunes Store app on iOS 7 may no longer function for downloading music directly to the device, as Apple has phased out support for older protocols. In 2025, attempting to access the iTunes Store often results in errors like “cannot connect” due to outdated security certificates or server-side changes.
  - **Syncing Challenges**: Syncing music requires a computer with a compatible iTunes version. Newer macOS versions (e.g., macOS Catalina and later) replaced iTunes with Finder for syncing, which may not support iOS 7 devices. You’d need an older macOS (e.g., Mojave or earlier) or Windows PC with iTunes installed.
- **Workaround for Music**:
  - If you have MP3 files or other compatible audio files, you can sync them to the iPhone 4 using an older iTunes version. The Music app will play these files without issues.
  - Jailbreaking could allow sideloading of alternative music player apps compatible with iOS 7, but these are rare and risky due to security vulnerabilities.
- **Verification**: The Music app is pre-installed on iOS 7 and cannot be deleted, so it should be present on any iPhone 4 unless the device has been heavily modified. Its icon is typically orange with a white musical note.

### Addressing the Mistake
My earlier response incorrectly assumed seamless music functionality without clarifying the syncing requirement and iTunes Store limitations. The Music app does exist and works for local playback, but getting music onto the device is the challenge due to Apple’s ecosystem changes and the iPhone 4’s inability to access modern iTunes or streaming services.

### Revised Summary for iPhone 4 Music in 2025
- **Music App**: Exists on iOS 7.1.2 and plays locally stored music synced via iTunes on a compatible computer.
- **Challenges**: No streaming, limited iTunes Store access, and syncing requires older software (e.g., iTunes on macOS Mojave or Windows).
- **Viability**: Functional for offline music playback if you can sync files, but cumbersome compared to modern devices.

### Other Apps/Software (Reiterated for Clarity)
To avoid further confusion, here’s a quick recap of other apps for the iPhone 4, as previously discussed, with no changes needed:
- **Calculator, Clock, Calendar**: Work fine for offline tasks.
- **Camera**: Functional for basic 5 MP photos and 720p video.
- **Notes, Contacts, Reminders**: Work locally but lack modern iCloud syncing.
- **Safari**: Limited web browsing due to outdated engine.
- **Maps**: Likely broken for real-time data due to API changes.
- **FaceTime, iMessage**: Unreliable due to compatibility issues.
- **Third-Party Apps**: Mostly incompatible due to iOS 12+ requirements.

### Final Note
The iPhone 4’s Music app is usable for local playback, but syncing music is the bottleneck due to Apple’s iTunes changes and server-side restrictions. If music is a priority, consider a second-hand iPhone 6 or newer, which supports iOS 12 and has fewer syncing issues. For example, an iPhone 6 can use older versions of Apple Music or third-party apps, though still with limitations. If you need help setting up music syncing for the iPhone 4, let me know your computer’s OS, and I can guide you on finding a compatible iTunes version.

Thanks for catching that oversight—hope this clears things up!

Using an iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1.2) or iPhone 6 (iOS 12.5.7) in 2025 highlights challenges for developers maintaining long-term software, especially when minimizing reliance on internet APIs or ensuring API longevity. Below, I’ll provide actionable tips for developers to create software that remains functional on such outdated devices, focusing on reducing dependency on internet APIs and maintaining APIs for long-term support. These tips are informed by the constraints seen with these iPhones (e.g., broken APIs, outdated OS, limited hardware) and general software longevity principles.

### Context: Why iPhone 4/6 Challenges Matter for Developers
- **iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1.2)**: Last updated in 2013, it’s limited to apps compatible with iOS 7, lacks modern security protocols, and cannot access most internet-dependent services due to server-side changes (e.g., Maps, iTunes Store).
- **iPhone 6 (iOS 12.5.7)**: Last updated in 2023, it supports more apps but struggles with modern APIs requiring iOS 13+ and lacks VoLTE, limiting network functionality.
- **Key Issues**: APIs fail due to server-side updates, deprecated protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0), or apps requiring newer iOS versions. Hardware constraints (e.g., 512 MB RAM on iPhone 4, 1 GB on iPhone 6) also limit performance.

### Tips for Developers Building Long-Term Software

#### 1. Minimize Dependency on Internet APIs
To ensure software remains functional on devices like the iPhone 4/6, reduce reliance on external APIs, which can break due to server changes or OS incompatibilities.

- **Prioritize Offline Functionality**:
  - Design apps to work fully or partially offline. For example, the Music app on iPhone 4 plays local files without internet, making it reliable in 2025.
  - Store critical data locally (e.g., SQLite databases, file-based storage) to avoid needing real-time API calls. For instance, a note-taking app should save notes locally and only sync when possible.
  - Cache data aggressively (e.g., maps tiles, media) to support offline use. Example: A navigation app could store regional maps for offline routing, unlike Apple Maps, which fails on iPhone 4 due to API changes.
- **Use Static or Bundled Resources**:
  - Bundle static data (e.g., lookup tables, configuration files) within the app. For example, a calculator app on both iPhones works because it’s self-contained.
  - Avoid dynamic content requiring server updates (e.g., news feeds, social media timelines), as seen with Instagram’s failure on iOS 7/12 due to server-side authentication changes.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**:
  - Implement fallbacks for when APIs are unavailable. For example, if a weather app’s API fails, display cached data or a static message instead of crashing.
  - Use local algorithms for features like search or filtering (e.g., a local search index for contacts) instead of relying on server-side search APIs.
- **Choose Lightweight Protocols**:
  - If internet access is needed, use simple, stable protocols like REST with JSON over complex ones like GraphQL, which may require newer libraries. iPhone 4’s Safari struggles with modern web APIs due to its outdated WebKit engine.

#### 2. Maintain and Future-Proof APIs
For developers who must use APIs, designing them for longevity ensures compatibility with older devices like the iPhone 4/6.

- **Version APIs Explicitly**:
  - Use semantic versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/endpoint`) and maintain older API versions for as long as feasible. For example, WhatsApp’s login failures on iPhone 4 stem from servers dropping support for iOS 7-compatible endpoints.
  - Deprecate APIs gradually, providing at least 2–3 years of backward compatibility. Notify users of deprecated endpoints via documentation or in-app alerts.
- **Support Older Security Protocols (When Safe)**:
  - Older devices like the iPhone 4 (iOS 7) use outdated security standards (e.g., TLS 1.0). If targeting such devices, allow fallback to older TLS versions in non-sensitive contexts, but prefer modern standards (TLS 1.2+) for security-critical apps.
  - Example: Apple’s iTunes Store stopped working on iPhone 4 because it requires TLS 1.2, unsupported by iOS 7.
- **Minimize Client-Side Dependencies**:
  - Avoid requiring modern libraries or frameworks that don’t run on older iOS versions. For instance, apps using SwiftUI or Combine won’t work on iOS 12 or earlier.
  - Use backward-compatible SDKs or polyfills. For example, include lightweight JSON parsers instead of relying on iOS 13+ APIs.
- **Graceful Degradation**:
  - Design APIs to degrade gracefully on older clients. If a new API feature requires iOS 13, ensure older clients (e.g., iOS 12 on iPhone 6) receive a basic response instead of an error.
  - Example: A messaging app could send plain text to iOS 7 clients while supporting rich media on newer devices.
- **Document and Test for Older Devices**:
  - Maintain documentation for minimum supported iOS versions and test against them (e.g., using emulators for iOS 7/12). This prevents unexpected breakages, like FaceTime’s compatibility issues on iPhone 4.

#### 3. Optimize for Low-End Hardware
Older devices like the iPhone 4 (512 MB RAM, A4 chip) and iPhone 6 (1 GB RAM, A8 chip) require lightweight software to avoid crashes or sluggish performance.

- **Reduce Resource Usage**:
  - Optimize for low memory and CPU. Avoid heavy animations or large data processing. For example, the Calculator app runs smoothly on both devices because it’s lightweight.
  - Use compressed assets (e.g., JPEG over PNG, low-bitrate audio) to fit within storage and memory constraints.
- **Test on Minimum Specs**:
  - Test apps on low-end devices or emulators mimicking iPhone 4/6 specs to ensure performance. For instance, the Photos app on iPhone 6 works well because it’s optimized for 1 GB RAM.
- **Avoid Multitasking Overloads**:
  - Limit background processes, as older iOS versions and low RAM cause apps to crash when multitasking. Example: Safari on iPhone 4 often reloads tabs due to memory constraints.

#### 4. Plan for Long-Term App Store Compatibility
The App Store’s restrictions limit what can be installed on older iOS versions, as seen with both iPhones.

- **Target Older iOS Versions**:
  - Set the minimum deployment target to iOS 7 (for iPhone 4) or iOS 12 (for iPhone 6) when building apps for legacy devices. Use Xcode’s older SDKs or conditional compilation to support outdated APIs.
  - Example: Apps like Geekbench 2 work on iPhone 4 because they target iOS 7.
- **Maintain Older App Versions**:
  - Allow users to download the last compatible version of your app for their iOS version via the App Store’s “Previously Purchased” feature. Apple supports this, but developers must ensure older versions remain functional.
  - Example: Some users report downloading older WhatsApp versions on iPhone 6, though login issues persist due to server changes.
- **Sideloading Workarounds**:
  - For niche use cases, consider distributing apps via enterprise certificates or jailbreaking (though risky). This allows installing apps not available on the App Store for iOS 7/12.

#### 5. Handle Obsolescence Gracefully
Plan for when devices or OS versions become unsupported to avoid abrupt failures, as seen with Maps or iTunes on iPhone 4.

- **Notify Users of End-of-Life**:
  - Display in-app warnings if the app will stop working due to server changes or iOS incompatibility. Example: Netflix could warn iPhone 6 users that iOS 13 is required for future updates.
- **Provide Offline Alternatives**:
  - If an API is deprecated, offer an offline mode or static data fallback. For example, a dictionary app could bundle a word database instead of relying on an online API.
- **Archive Server-Side Code**:
  - Maintain server-side code for older APIs in a low-cost environment (e.g., lightweight cloud instance) to support legacy users longer, reducing costs while preserving functionality.

#### 6. Learn from Successful Long-Lived Apps
Study apps that still work on iPhone 4/6 to emulate their strategies:
- **Calculator, Clock**: Fully offline, minimal dependencies, lightweight.
- **Music (iPhone 4)**: Relies on local files, not streaming, ensuring functionality despite iTunes Store changes.
- **Notes**: Stores data locally with optional syncing, remaining usable even if iCloud fails.

### Specific Lessons from iPhone 4/6
- **API Breakages**: Apps like Maps fail because server-side APIs evolved (e.g., new map data formats). Developers should use stable, versioned APIs and cache data locally.
- **Security Protocol Issues**: iTunes Store and FaceTime break due to outdated TLS versions. Support older protocols or provide offline alternatives.
- **App Store Limits**: Most apps require iOS 13+, leaving iPhone 4/6 users with few options. Target older iOS versions explicitly or maintain legacy versions.
- **Hardware Constraints**: iPhone 4’s 512 MB RAM causes crashes with modern apps. Optimize for low memory and CPU.

### Practical Example: Building a Long-Lived App
Suppose you’re developing a note-taking app for iPhone 4/6:
- **Offline First**: Store notes in a local SQLite database. Allow optional iCloud sync with backward-compatible endpoints.
- **Lightweight Design**: Use simple UI (UIKit, not SwiftUI) to run on iOS 7/12 with minimal RAM usage.
- **API Strategy**: Use a REST API with `/v1/notes` endpoint, supporting TLS 1.0 for iPhone 4 (non-sensitive data only). Cache notes locally for offline access.
- **App Store**: Set minimum deployment to iOS 7, test on emulators, and maintain older app versions in the App Store.
- **End-of-Life Plan**: Notify users if iOS 7 support ends, offering a static export feature for notes.

### Conclusion
To build long-term software for devices like the iPhone 4/6:
1. **Minimize API use**: Prioritize offline functionality, cache data, and use static resources.
2. **Maintain APIs**: Version APIs, support older protocols, and degrade gracefully.
3. **Optimize for hardware**: Target low RAM/CPU and test on old devices.
4. **Plan for App Store**: Support older iOS versions and maintain legacy app versions.
5. **Handle obsolescence**: Warn users of end-of-life and provide offline fallbacks.

By following these principles, developers can create apps that remain functional for years, even on outdated devices like the iPhone 4/6, avoiding the pitfalls seen with broken APIs (e.g., Maps, iTunes). If you’re working on a specific app, share details, and I can tailor these tips further!
