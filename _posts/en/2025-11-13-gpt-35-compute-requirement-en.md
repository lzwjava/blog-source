title: Training GPT-3.5 Requires Far More Compute
translated: false
type: note
---

No, the total compute from a single NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti GPU running non-stop for one year at 90% utilization (1.14 × 10²¹ FLOPs) is far short of what's needed to train a model like GPT-3.5 from scratch.

### Key Comparison
- **Required for GPT-3.5 training**: Estimates place the pre-training compute for GPT-3.5 (similar to GPT-3 in scale, with around 175 billion parameters) at approximately 3.14 × 10²³ FLOPs. This is based on public analyses of GPT-3's training, as OpenAI hasn't released exact figures for GPT-3.5, but it's widely considered comparable.
- **Your scenario**: 1.14 × 10²¹ FLOPs is only about 0.36% of that amount—meaning you'd need roughly 275 times more compute (or equivalently, 275 such GPU-years) to match the training requirements.
- **Time on one GPU**: Even if you could somehow run the training on a single GPU (which you can't, due to memory limits—GPT-3.5 would require hundreds of GB of VRAM), it would take around 35 years based on similar calculations for high-end GPUs like the A100.

### Practical Limitations
Beyond raw FLOPs, training a large language model like GPT-3.5 requires:
- **Massive parallelism**: It was trained on thousands of GPUs simultaneously (e.g., clusters of A100s) to handle the model's size and complete training in months, not years.
- **Data and infrastructure**: Access to enormous datasets (trillions of tokens), specialized software, and cooling/power setups that a single consumer GPU can't provide.
- **Efficiency tweaks**: Modern training uses mixed precision (e.g., FP16), optimizers, and distributed systems, but even optimized, one GPU-year won't cut it.

If you're interested in smaller-scale experiments, consider fine-tuning pre-trained models or training tiny LLMs (e.g., with 1-10 billion parameters) on consumer hardware—these can be done with far less compute, often in days or weeks.
