"Expats" is a short form of **expatriates**.

**Meaning in English**:  
People who live outside their native country (usually for work, retirement, or lifestyle reasons). They are citizens of one country but reside in another, often temporarily or long-term.

**Examples**:  
- An American teacher working in Taiwan is an **expat** in Taiwan.  
- A British retiree living in Thailand is an **expat**.  
- Taiwanese professionals working in Singapore or the US are also called **expats**.

Sometimes people just say “expats” casually to refer to foreign residents or the international/foreigner community in a place (very common in cities like Taipei, Shanghai, Bangkok, etc.).
