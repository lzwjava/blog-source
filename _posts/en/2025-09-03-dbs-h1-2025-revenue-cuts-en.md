Here’s what I found for DBS Bank (specifically its parent DBS Group Holdings) for the first half of 2025:

### First Half of 2025 Financial Performance

* **Total income (i.e., revenue):** S\$11.6 billion (\~US\$9.06 billion), reflecting a 5 % year‑on‑year increase and setting a new record for the bank. ([Asian Banking & Finance][1])
* **Profit before tax:** S\$6.83 billion (\~US\$4.9 billion), up 3 % from the previous year’s first half, also a new high. ([Asian Banking & Finance][1])
* **Net profit:** S\$5.72 billion (\~US\$4.45 billion), essentially flat compared to H1 2024. ([Asian Banking & Finance][1])

### Employee and Contractor Count

* **Employees:** As of December 31, 2024, DBS Group had approximately **41,000 employees** globally. ([StockAnalysis][2])
* **Contractors / Temporary Staff:** At the end of 2024, DBS had about **8,000 to 9,000 contract or temporary workers**. ([Fortune][3])

In total, DBS Group’s workforce—including permanent and contract staff—was approximately **49,000 to 50,000 people** at the end of 2024.

Additionally, CEO Piyush Gupta announced plans to reduce the workforce by around **4,000 roles (10%) over the next three years**, largely via natural attrition of temporary and contract positions. ([Reuters][4], [Business Standard][5])
