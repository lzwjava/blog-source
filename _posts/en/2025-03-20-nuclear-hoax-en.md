Miles Mathis, a controversial writer known for challenging mainstream scientific and historical narratives, holds a highly skeptical view of nuclear power stations. He believes they might be part of a grand deception, questioning both their functionality and the science behind them. Below is an overview of his perspective:

### Nuclear Technology as a Hoax
Mathis argues that nuclear technology—including nuclear power stations—may not work as officially claimed. He suggests that the entire concept of nuclear energy, based on fission and fusion, could be a hoax. His skepticism rests on two main pillars:

- **Doubts About Nuclear Tests**: Mathis examines historical nuclear tests, such as those at Bikini Atoll and the Trinity site, and finds the evidence unconvincing. He points to inconsistencies in photos and videos, such as minimal visible damage or inadequate protective measures, which he believes don’t match the expected effects of nuclear explosions. He even suggests these events might have been staged or exaggerated, noting that many tests were heavily documented and "scripted" in a way he finds suspicious for scientific experiments.

- **Critique of Scientific Foundations**: Mathis challenges the physics behind nuclear reactions, claiming that the theories of fission and fusion are flawed. He references scientists like Steven Crothers and Pierre-Marie Robitaille to support his view that the mathematics and science underpinning nuclear power don’t hold up. If the foundational science is incorrect, he argues, then nuclear power stations cannot function as advertised.

### Implications for Nuclear Power Stations
If nuclear energy is a hoax, Mathis implies that the energy credited to nuclear power stations might actually come from conventional sources, like fossil fuels or other hidden methods. He hints that the nuclear industry could be a facade, possibly maintained for purposes like control or misinformation, though he doesn’t fully elaborate on the motives.

### A Skeptical Approach, Not Definitive Proof
It’s important to emphasize that Mathis doesn’t offer concrete evidence proving nuclear stations are fake. Instead, his method is to highlight inconsistencies and raise doubts about the official narrative. He encourages readers to question the established story rather than accept it at face value.

### Context in Mathis’s Broader Work
This view fits into Mathis’s larger pattern of skepticism toward mainstream science and history. He often portrays widely accepted technologies and events—like nuclear power—as exaggerated or fabricated, part of a broader effort to mislead the public.

### A Note of Caution
Mathis’s ideas are not supported by the scientific community, which has extensively documented nuclear power as a real, effective technology. His arguments are speculative and contrast with the tangible evidence of nuclear energy’s role in modern power grids.

In summary, Miles Mathis thinks nuclear power stations might be a hoax, based on his doubts about nuclear tests and the science of fission and fusion. He sees them as potentially part of a larger deception, though his claims remain speculative and lack definitive proof.
