For a long time, I relied heavily on WeChat File Helper to synchronize files and text between my computer and phone. Recently, however, I discovered that chatbots like ChatGPT or Kimi Chat can also serve as effective tools for syncing information across devices.

The underlying principle is straightforward: if a software’s Mac or iOS versions support synchronization, we can leverage it to sync data seamlessly. For example, on my Ubuntu computer, when the VPN connection fails, I need to share a Shadowsocks URL to restore access to foreign networks. While using WeChat’s web version works well, I recently tried Kimi Chat for this purpose and found it to be equally convenient. Here’s how it worked:

1. I shared the Shadowsocks URL to Kimi Chat via my mobile phone.  
2. I logged into Kimi Chat’s web version on my Ubuntu computer.  
3. The Shadowsocks URL was instantly accessible.  

This method isn’t limited to text. The profile avatar feature can also be used to share images between devices. If we can share images, we can share almost anything. For instance, QR codes can be used to encode and transfer text efficiently.

If we think more deeply, this isn’t just about specific features of apps—it’s about the concept of shared fields or APIs. If a field’s value can be synchronized across a computer and mobile app, we can use that field to share data. For example, a link field in an app like X (formerly Twitter) can be used to share URLs across devices. This approach highlights the versatility of synchronization tools, offering a simple and effective way to bridge the gap between devices.
