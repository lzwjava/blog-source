title: Psycopg2 PostgreSQL Adapter for Python
translated: false
type: note
---

**Psycopg2** is a popular open-source PostgreSQL database adapter (also known as a driver) for the Python programming language. It allows Python applications to connect to PostgreSQL databases, execute SQL queries, and handle data efficiently. Key features include:

- Full compliance with the Python DB API 2.0 specification.
- Support for asynchronous notifications, server-side cursors, and COPY operations.
- Written in C for better performance, with optional binary support for faster data transfer.
- Widely used in production environments for tasks like web development, data analysis, and ETL processes.

It's the second generation of the psycopg library (hence the "2"), and while psycopg3 is the newer version, psycopg2 remains stable and actively maintained for legacy compatibility.

For installation, you can use `pip install psycopg2-binary` (the binary version is easier for beginners).
