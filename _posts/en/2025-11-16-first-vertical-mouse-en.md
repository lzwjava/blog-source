The vertical mouse was invented in 1994.

The first commercially available vertical mouse is widely credited to **Jack Lo** (a Canadian inventor) with the **ErgoMouse** (also sometimes called the "Handshake Mouse"). It was patented in the early 1990s and released in **1994** by a company called Hobar Tech (later known as Evoluent).

### Key milestones
- **1992–1994**: Jack Lo files patents for a vertical computer mouse designed to keep the hand in a neutral “handshake” position to reduce wrist pronation and strain.
- **1994**: The first vertical mouse hits the market under the name **ErgoMouse**.
- **2002**: Evoluent releases the **Evoluent VerticalMouse** (version 1), which becomes one of the most popular and long-lasting vertical mouse designs still sold today (now in version 4/5).

Before these, there were some earlier ergonomic experiments (e.g., tilted or angled mice in the late 1980s/early 1990s), but the true upright/vertical design that keeps the forearm in neutral position started with Jack Lo’s 1994 ErgoMouse.

So the short answer: **1994**.
