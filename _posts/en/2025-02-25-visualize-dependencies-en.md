To visualize the Maven dependencies graph generated by the provided Python script, you can use **Graphviz**, a widely-used and straightforward graphic tool that renders graphs described in the DOT language. The script outputs a dependency graph in DOT format, representing dependencies between modules within your Maven project as a directed graph, with nodes labeled by `artifactId`s and edges showing dependency relationships. Below are the steps to draw and visualize this graph using Graphviz, along with mentions of alternative tools like Polyglot or others if you prefer different options.

### Using Graphviz (Recommended Approach)

Graphviz is ideal here because the script directly generates DOT format output, which Graphviz natively supports. Follow these steps:

1. **Run the Script**  
   Execute the Python script, providing the root directory of your Maven project as an argument. This generates the DOT output for the dependency graph.
   ```bash
   python script.py /path/to/maven/project
   ```

2. **Save the DOT Output to a File**  
   Redirect the script’s output to a file, for example, `dependencies.dot`. This file will contain the graph description in DOT format.
   ```bash
   python script.py /path/to/maven/project > dependencies.dot
   ```

3. **Install Graphviz (if not already installed)**  
   Graphviz is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Install it using your package manager:
   - **Ubuntu/Debian**:  
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install graphviz
     ```
   - **macOS (with Homebrew)**:  
     ```bash
     brew install graphviz
     ```
   - **Windows**: Download and install from the [Graphviz website](https://graphviz.org/download/).

4. **Generate a Visual Image**  
   Use the `dot` command from Graphviz to convert the DOT file into an image. For example, to create a PNG file:
   ```bash
   dot -Tpng dependencies.dot -o dependencies.png
   ```
   - You can replace `-Tpng` with other formats like `-Tsvg` for SVG or `-Tpdf` for PDF, depending on your preference.

5. **View the Graph**  
   Open the generated `dependencies.png` file with any image viewer to see the dependency graph. Each node will represent a module’s `artifactId`, and arrows will indicate dependencies between modules.

### Alternative Tools

If you’d rather not use Graphviz or want to explore other common graphic tools, here are some options:

#### Polyglot Notebooks (e.g., with Jupyter)
Polyglot Notebooks don’t directly visualize DOT files, but you can integrate Graphviz within a Jupyter notebook environment:
- **Steps**:
  1. Install Graphviz and the `graphviz` Python package:
     ```bash
     pip install graphviz
     sudo apt-get install graphviz  # For Ubuntu, adjust for your OS
     ```
  2. Modify the script to use Python’s `graphviz` library instead of printing raw DOT. Add this at the end of your script:
     ```python
     from graphviz import Digraph

     dot = Digraph()
     for from_module, to_module in sorted(dependencies):
         dot.edge(from_module, to_module)
     dot.render('dependencies', format='png', view=True)
     ```
  3. Run the modified script to generate and display `dependencies.png` directly.
- **Note**: This still relies on Graphviz under the hood, so it’s not a completely separate tool.

#### Gephi
Gephi is an open-source network visualization tool that can import DOT files:
- **Steps**:
  1. Download and install Gephi from [gephi.org](https://gephi.org/).
  2. Run the script and save the DOT output to `dependencies.dot`.
  3. Open Gephi, go to `File > Import > Graph File`, and select `dependencies.dot`.
  4. Adjust the layout (e.g., ForceAtlas 2) and visualize interactively.
- **Pros**: Great for large graphs with advanced layout options.
- **Cons**: Requires manual import and setup.

#### Online Graphviz Tools
For a quick, no-install option:
- **Steps**:
  1. Run the script and copy the DOT output (from `digraph G {` to `}`).
  2. Visit an online tool like [GraphvizOnline](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/).
  3. Paste the DOT content and click to render the graph.
- **Pros**: No installation needed.
- **Cons**: Requires internet access; less control over output format.

#### yEd
yEd is a free graph editor, but it doesn’t natively support DOT:
- **Steps**:
  1. Convert the DOT file to GraphML or another supported format using a tool like `dot` (e.g., `dot -Tgraphml dependencies.dot -o dependencies.graphml`).
  2. Open yEd, import the GraphML file, and adjust the layout.
- **Cons**: Extra conversion step required.

### Why Graphviz is Best Here
The script’s output is tailored for DOT, making Graphviz the most direct and efficient choice. It’s lightweight, command-line driven, and widely supported. The generated graph will look something like this (conceptually):
- Nodes: `artifactId` of each module (e.g., `"module-a"`, `"module-b"`).
- Edges: Arrows like `"module-a" -> "module-b"`, showing that `module-a` depends on `module-b`.

If your graph is large, you can tweak the layout with Graphviz options (e.g., `dot -Kneato` for a different arrangement), but the basic steps above should suffice.

### Final Recommendation
To visualize the Maven dependencies graph from your script:
1. Run: `python script.py /path/to/maven/project > dependencies.dot`
2. Install Graphviz if needed.
3. Convert to an image: `dot -Tpng dependencies.dot -o dependencies.png`
4. Open `dependencies.png` to view your graph.

This approach is simple, uses a common tool (Graphviz), and aligns perfectly with your script’s output. If you need interactivity or alternative formats, try Gephi or an online tool instead.
