### Parking at Lixiang Park (North Gate), Shenzhen

Thanks for the clarification—yes, you're referring to **Lixiang Park (荔香公园)** in Shenzhen's Nanshan District, named after the fragrant lychee ("lizhi" for lychee + "xiang" for fragrance). It's a lovely 22-hectare urban oasis right along Shennan Avenue (Shennan Dadao), at the intersection with Nanhai Avenue—super central, with the north gate facing the avenue for easy access. The park is free to enter, but its parking lots (including the north gate) often require advance reservation to snag a spot, especially on weekends, evenings, or holidays when families flock here for picnics, jogging, or the seasonal lychee blooms.

#### How Pre-Ordering Works
Reservations are free and handled via the official WeChat mini program **"Park Shenzhen" (公园深圳)**, linked through the "Beautiful Shenzhen" (美丽深圳) WeChat official account. This is Shenzhen's go-to tool for public park bookings, covering dozens of green spaces citywide. You can book up to 2 hours in advance on regular days (more lead time advised for peaks like National Day). Here's the step-by-step (all in Chinese—use WeChat's built-in translation or an app like Google Translate for screenshots):

1. **Open WeChat**: Search for and follow "Beautiful Shenzhen" (美丽深圳), or directly search for the "Park Shenzhen" mini program (Discover > Mini Programs).
2. **Access Parking**: Tap "Park Services" (公园服务) > "Parking Reservation" (预约停车) > "Online Appointment" (在线预约).
3. **Select the Park and Lot**: Search for "Lixiang Park" (荔香公园), then choose "North Gate Parking Lot" (北门停车场). Check real-time availability—spots fill fast (the lot holds about 100-150 cars).
4. **Book Your Spot**: Bind your vehicle first if not done (enter license plate, owner details, and verify via SMS). Then input arrival time (slots are typically 1-4 hours), confirm, and get a QR code.
5. **At the Gate**: Drive up to the north gate (off Shennan Dadao, near Nanhai Ave), scan your QR at the barrier. No extra payment needed—parking is free for the reserved duration (up to 4 hours max per slot; overstays may incur fees).

- **Alternative Entry**: Or use this direct link in WeChat: [smartum.sz.gov.cn/tcyy/parking/lot-mobile/main](https://smartum.sz.gov.cn/tcyy/parking/lot-mobile/main). For a full guide, follow "Shenzhen Local Bao" (深圳本地宝) WeChat and message "公园停车" (park parking).
- **Tips**: Book via mobile data (Chinese SIM ideal for verification). If full, try the west gate (no reservation but smaller) or nearby street parking (¥2-5/hour). North gate is closest to the main lawns and lychee groves. Electric vehicle chargers available inside.
- **Location Pin**: 518052, Nanshan District—right on Shennan Dadao, 5-10 min walk from metro (Nanshan Station).

#### Is Pre-Ordering Common in China (Shenzhen/Guangzhou)?
Absolutely—it's a smart-city staple in major hubs to cut traffic and emissions, rolled out widely since 2020. In **Shenzhen**, it's standard for 20+ busy parks (like Lixiang, Lianhuashan, or Shenzhen Bay) via the unified "Park Shenzhen" system—over 80% of urban park visits now use WeChat/Alipay for bookings. Free spots are prioritized for greenspaces to encourage outdoor time.

In **Guangzhou**, it's growing but patchier—not as seamless. Some spots like Dafushan Forest Park or Bio-Island use WeChat mini programs/apps (e.g., "Sù Tíng Chē" for payments) for reservations, especially during holidays. Citywide, about 10-15% of parks (out of 1,200+) require it, per local policies, but it's more for events or paid lots. Expect more "first-come" chaos, though apps like "Guangzhou Travel" are catching up. Overall in China, WeChat dominates (90%+ of bookings), with Alipay backups—it's everywhere in Tier 1 cities but rarer in smaller ones.

For real-time updates (e.g., October 2025 events), check the "Beautiful Shenzhen" account. Enjoy the lychee vibes!
