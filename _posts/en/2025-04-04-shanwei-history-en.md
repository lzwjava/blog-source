While your current location is Shengang Township, Changhua County, Taiwan, you're asking about the history of Shanwei in Guangdong Province, China. Here's a look at its past:

**Early Settlement and Administration:**

* The region of present-day Shanwei was inhabited in prehistoric times by non-Han ethnic groups who lived along the coast, primarily engaged in fishing.
* During the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC), the area came under Chinese administration as part of Nanhai Commandery.
* For a long period under the Ming and Qing empires, Shanwei was administered as part of Huizhou Prefecture (惠州府).

**Emergence of Shanwei:**

* The dominant ethnic population today is Hoklo (Minnan speakers), who migrated to the area during the early Qing Dynasty (17th century) due to warfare elsewhere, leading to a decrease in the local population.
* Shanwei gained prefectural and administrative independence from Huizhou during the Nationalist period in the 20th century.
* Shanwei City was officially established in **1988**.

**Coastal Significance and Economy:**

* Shanwei has a long history as a fishing ground, with a diverse sea ecosystem supporting various types of seafood. This has been a vital part of the local economy for centuries.
* The area was also known for salt production during the Qing Dynasty.
* In more recent times, agriculture has also become a significant part of Shanwei's economy, with a relatively warm climate allowing for the cultivation of various crops.

**Modern Development:**

* Shanwei is one of the 13 communist revolution starting points in China, which has become a point of local historical significance.
* In recent decades, Shanwei has developed into a modern city with a focus on industries such as offshore wind power, electronics, information technology, and car parts.
* Tourism is also growing, with attractions like the Red Sea Bay, beaches, and historical temples drawing visitors.
* Shanwei maintains strong connections with overseas Chinese communities, many of whom have ancestral roots in the Chaoshan region (which includes Shanwei).

**Not a Treaty Port:**

* It's important to note that unlike nearby Shantou, **Shanwei was not designated as a treaty port** in the 19th century. This means it did not experience the same kind of direct foreign influence and rapid international trade development during that era. Its development trajectory has been different.

In summary, Shanwei's history is rooted in its coastal location and its role as a fishing and agricultural area. While it was under the administration of larger prefectures for a long time, it eventually gained its own administrative status and has developed into a modern city with a growing industrial and tourism sector, while also holding historical significance related to the early communist movement in China.
