### IBM DB2 Error Code -104 (SQLSTATE 42601)

This error indicates a **syntax error** in an SQL statement parsed by DB2. Specifically, it occurs when the SQL parser encounters an **unexpected token** (e.g., a keyword, symbol, or identifier) that doesn't fit the expected grammar rules at that point in the statement.

#### Common Details:
- **SQLCODE**: -104
- **SQLSTATE**: 42601 (a Class 42 error, which pertains to syntax or access rule violations)
- **Uninformative indicator**: This means the error message isn't complete; DB2 will provide more context, such as the unexpected token and what was expected instead.

#### Typical Message Format:
"An unexpected token 'X' was found following 'Y'. Expected tokens may include: 'Z'. SQLCODE=-104, SQLSTATE=42601"

For example:
- If you accidentally use a reserved word incorrectly, like "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ;" (missing value after =), you might get something like: "An unexpected token ';' was found following 'id = '."
- Another case: Typo in keywords, e.g., "SELCT * FROM table;" where "SELCT" is invalid.

#### Causes:
- Typographical errors (e.g., misspelled keywords like "SELCT" instead of "SELECT").
- Missing or misplaced punctuation (commas, parentheses, semicolons).
- Incorrect use of identifiers, operators, or clauses (e.g., putting a WHERE clause before FROM).
- Unsupported syntax for the specific DB2 version or dialect (e.g., trying to use non-standard SQL extensions).

#### How to Resolve:
1. **Review the SQL statement**: Double-check for typos, especially in keywords, table names, and operators. Compare against DB2 documentation for proper syntax.
2. **Use tools**: Run the statement through a DB2 command line interface (e.g., DB2 CLP) or a SQL editor with syntax highlighting to spot issues early.
3. **Common fixes**:
   - Ensure keywords are spelled correctly and used in the right order (e.g., SELECT, FROM, WHERE).
   - Check for balanced parentheses and quotes.
   - If using dynamic SQL, validate the generated string.
4. **Test incrementally**: Break complex queries into smaller parts to isolate the error.

If you're encountering this in a specific context (e.g., a stored procedure or application code), sharing the exact SQL and full error message can help diagnose further.
