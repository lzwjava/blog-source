title: Three Angle Stick Stand Structure
translated: false
---



I've been thinking about structural stability recently, particularly after noticing how the height of my projector stand impacts its balance. When the stand is extended, the heavy projector becomes much more susceptible to tipping. Even a slight 10 cm increase in height, if the projector isn't perfectly level, dramatically increases the force on the base, making the entire setup prone to falling.

That's why when people build very tall buildings, they must extend the foundations deep into the ground. This ensures the structures remain stable and prevents them from collapsing.

This experience with the projector stand's instability reminded me of J. E. Gordon's book, *Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down*, which I'm hoping to read soon.
