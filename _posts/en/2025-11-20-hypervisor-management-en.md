A **hypervisor** (also called a **virtual machine monitor** or VMM) is the core software (or sometimes firmware/hardware) that creates, runs, and manages **virtual machines (VMs)** on a physical host computer. It is what makes virtualization possible by abstracting and sharing the physical hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, network, etc.) among multiple isolated virtual machines.

### Two Main Types of Hypervisors

| Type | Description | Runs Directly on Hardware? | Examples | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------------|-----------------------------|----------|------|------|
| **Type 1 (Bare-metal)** | Installed and runs directly on the physical hardware. No host OS underneath the hypervisor. | Yes | VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V (in hypervisor mode), Xen, KVM (when used bare-metal), Proxmox VE, Oracle VM Server | Best performance, higher security, lower overhead, used in production/data-center environments | Harder to manage for beginners, fewer built-in drivers/tools |
| **Type 2 (Hosted)** | Runs as an application on top of a conventional operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux). The host OS owns the hardware. | No (runs on host OS) | VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion, VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop, QEMU (when used with a host OS) | Easy to install and use, good for desktops/laptops, can use host OS drivers and tools | Slightly lower performance, more attack surface because of the host OS |

### How a Hypervisor Works (Simplified)

1. **Resource abstraction** – The hypervisor presents virtual CPUs (vCPUs), virtual RAM, virtual disks, virtual NICs, etc., to each VM.
2. **Isolation** – Each VM is completely isolated; one VM crashing or being compromised normally doesn’t affect others.
3. **Scheduling** – The hypervisor schedules which VM gets to use the physical CPU/RAM at any given moment (time-sharing).
4. **Trap-and-emulate** – When a VM tries to execute privileged instructions (e.g., change page tables, access hardware), the CPU traps to the hypervisor, which safely emulates or handles the request.
5. **Hardware acceleration** – Modern CPUs have virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x, AMD-V) that make the trap-and-emulate process extremely fast (near-native performance).

### Common Use Cases

- Server consolidation (run dozens of VMs on one physical server)
- Cloud computing (AWS EC2, Azure VMs, GCP Compute Engine all use hypervisors under the hood)
- Development/testing environments
- Desktop virtualization (run Windows on macOS or multiple Linux distros side-by-side)
- Security sandboxes and malware analysis

### Popular Hypervisors Today (2025)

- **VMware ESXi** – Dominant in enterprises (part of Broadcom now)
- **Microsoft Hyper-V** – Built into Windows Server and Windows 10/11 Pro
- **KVM** – Default in Linux, powers most OpenStack and public clouds (Google Cloud, AWS Nitro, etc.)
- **Proxmox VE** – Open-source Type-1 based on Debian + KVM + LXC
- **Xen** – Used by Oracle Cloud, AWS (older generations), XCP-ng
- **VirtualBox** – Free Type-2 from Oracle, very popular for personal use
- **Nutanix AHV** – Acropolis Hypervisor (based on KVM) for HCI

In short: the hypervisor is the “orchestra conductor” that lets multiple operating systems safely and efficiently share the same physical computer. Type 1 is what you’ll find in data centers and clouds; Type 2 is what desktop users typically install.
