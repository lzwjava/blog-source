### SQL Server vs. MySQL: A 2025 Comparison

Microsoft SQL Server (often abbreviated as MSSQL) and MySQL are both popular relational database management systems (RDBMS), but they cater to different needs. SQL Server is a proprietary Microsoft product optimized for enterprise environments, while MySQL is an open-source Oracle-owned system favored for web and cost-sensitive applications. Below is a side-by-side comparison across key aspects, drawn from recent analyses.

| Aspect          | SQL Server                                                                 | MySQL                                                                 |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture** | Uses a single storage engine with SQL OS layer for cross-platform consistency; supports in-memory OLTP, table partitioning, and .NET integration via T-SQL and CLR procedures. Native Windows support, Linux since 2017, and Docker for macOS. | Multi-storage engine (e.g., InnoDB for transactions, MyISAM for reads); thread-based for efficiency. Platform-independent (Windows, Linux, macOS). Supports replication (master-slave/multi-source) and procedural SQL routines. |
| **Performance** | Excels in complex queries, joins, aggregations, and analytical workloads with parallel processing, adaptive joins, and in-memory OLTP. Strong for high-volume transactional and OLAP tasks; Resource Governor for workload management. | Better for read-heavy web workloads and high connections on modest hardware; query cache (phasing out) and HeatWave for analytics. Less efficient for complex enterprise queries but lightweight overall. |
| **Scalability** | Up to 524PB database size (Enterprise Edition); vertical scaling to 128 cores, horizontal via Always On Availability Groups, sharding, or Kubernetes Big Data Clusters. Handles thousands of connections. | Up to 100TB practical limit, 32TB tables; vertical to 48 cores, horizontal via clustering/sharding. Configurable for thousands of connections; efficient for mid-scale but may need add-ons for massive growth. |
| **Cost**        | Commercial licensing: Express (free, 10GB limit), Standard (~$899/2-cores), Enterprise (~$13,748/2-cores or $15K+/server/year). Higher cloud costs (e.g., $0.12–$10/hr on AWS); per-core model increases TCO. Free trials available. | Community Edition free (GPL); Enterprise ~$2K–$10K/server/year for advanced features. Lower cloud pricing (e.g., $0.08–$0.90/hr on AWS); up to 16x cheaper than SQL Server per TCO estimates. |
| **Features**    | T-SQL extensions, native vector support for AI/ML, columnstore indexes, full-text search, SSMS for management, in-database ML (R/Python), JSON/spatial data, Fabric Mirroring, and regex/NoSQL enhancements in 2025. | Standard SQL with JSON/spatial, HeatWave ML (limited vectors), JavaScript API, MySQL Workbench, full-text search (InnoDB limited), partitioning, and enhanced foreign keys in 9.2 (2025). |
| **Security**    | Advanced: Always Encrypted, TDE, row-level security, Dynamic Data Masking, Extended Events auditing, Active Directory/Entra ID integration, and comprehensive roles/permissions. | Solid basics: SSL/TLS, data-at-rest encryption, RBAC, audit plugins (Enterprise). Relies on extensions for enterprise-grade features like masking. |
| **Use Cases**   | Enterprise apps, Microsoft ecosystem (.NET/Azure/Power BI), AI/analytics, regulated industries (finance/healthcare), data warehousing, and mission-critical OLTP/OLAP. | Web apps (LAMP stack), e-commerce/CMS, startups, multi-cloud/hybrid setups, read-heavy workloads, and open-source projects. |
| **Pros**        | Robust for large-scale/complex tasks; seamless Microsoft integration; strong AI/ML/security; high reliability/uptime. | Cost-effective/open-source; lightweight/cross-platform; easy for web/dev; strong community support/flexibility. |
| **Cons**        | Expensive licensing/hardware; steeper learning curve; Windows-centric (though improving); resource-heavy. | Limited advanced analytics/security out-of-box; performance dips in high-concurrency/complex queries; community version lacks enterprise tools. |
| **Ratings (2025)** | Overall 4.6/5 (1,962 reviews); Ease of Use 4.3; Value 4.3; Best for enterprises/large data (87% fit score). | Overall 4.6/5 (2,089 reviews); Ease of Use 4.4; Value 4.6; Best for small/mid-size/web (93% fit score). |

In summary, choose SQL Server for robust, feature-rich enterprise needs with deep Microsoft ties, despite higher costs. Opt for MySQL if prioritizing affordability, simplicity, and open-source flexibility for web or smaller-scale deployments. For production decisions, test with your workload.
