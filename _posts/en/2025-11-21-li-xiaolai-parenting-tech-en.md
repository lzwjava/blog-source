title: Li Xiaolai's Parenting Tech Advice
translated: false
type: note

Xiaolai Li (李笑来), a well-known in China as an author, investor, and educator, has shared various parenting insights over the years, often through his books, columns, and paid communities/societies focused on family education and personal growth. While I couldn't find an exact public quote matching the precise phrasing "before primary school, do not let children touch digital devices; first learn keyboard with a computer," his overall views on children's screen time and technology exposure align closely with restrictive approaches, especially emphasizing attention protection and productive use of tools.

### Key elements of his related parenting advice (from his works like *The Truth About Focus* and family education courses):
- He strongly warns against excessive or early exposure to **mobile devices** (phones, tablets, iPads) for young children. He believes smartphones and touchscreens "hijack" attention and can cause long-term damage to focus and brain development. In his book *The Truth About Focus* (专注的真相), he explicitly suggests that children should avoid prolonged phone use until a certain age, and parents should prioritize habits like exercise, reading aloud, or music instead of screens.
- He advocates for **delayed or controlled introduction** to technology, favoring tools that build real skills over passive consumption. He has promoted learning practical skills early — including typing on a **physical keyboard** (not touchscreen virtual keyboards) — because proper touch-typing is a foundational skill for future productivity, writing, and programming (he even wrote books teaching programming as a "craft" anyone can learn).
- In his family growth communities and lectures, he stresses that young children should avoid addictive digital entertainment (games, social media, or endless scrolling — common on phones — to protect attention spans. Computers (with keyboards) are seen as more "serious" tools for creation (e.g., writing, coding), rather than consumption.

### Is this "wisdom" sound in 2025?
It's **partially wise and evidence-aligned**, especially the caution on **touchscreens** for very young children (under 6–7 years old):
- Major health organizations (AAP, WHO, Chinese Pediatric Association) recommend **no screens** for kids under 18–24 months (except video calls), and **very limited high-quality** content only after that. They warn excessive screen time links to poorer language delays, attention issues, sleep problems, obesity, and weaker motor/social skills.
- Touchscreens encourage passive swiping, and in China-specific research shows pinyin-based typing on phones/tablets, hinders character recognition and handwriting skills crucial for Chinese literacy (since kids rely on phonetic input instead of visual strokes).
- Introducing a **physical keyboard** early (around 5–7 years old, when fine motor skills develop) can be beneficial. Touch-typing builds muscle memory, boosts future efficiency, and avoids bad habits from touchscreen pecking. Many educators see it as a "productive" digital skill, unlike endless videos/games.

But it's not the only approach:
- Some experts argue zero digital exposure is outdated in 2025. Controlled, educational use (e.g., coding apps, interactive learning) can enhance visuospatial skills, creativity, and digital literacy.
- Strict "no devices until primary school" risks leaving kids behind in a world where basic tech fluency starts early (many schools now require it).

### Overall assessment of his "parenting wisdom" here
- **Strong on attention protection** — very aligned with science on how addictive touchscreens fragment focus.
- **Practical on keyboards** — excellent for future-proof skills (writing, coding, productivity).
- **Potentially overly rigid** — if interpreted as "no tech at all" before age 7. A balanced view (his likely intent) is healthier: delay addictive screens, prioritize real-world play/reading, but teach useful tools (keyboard, basic computer) when ready.

In practice, many parents inspired by him report success with rules like "no phone until high school" + early typing lessons.

If you're looking for his exact quote might come from a paid course (e.g., his "Family Growth Annual Community" or "Good Family Education" series, or older columns). His views evolved, but the core idea — protect young brains from addictive screens, but teach productive tools early — remains consistent.

In short: His advice is **quite forward-thinking** for Chinese parents, where early device exposure is common, and kids often learn pinyin, input on phones first. It's a smart emphasis on "creation" over "consumption" — a philosophy he applies to everything from writing, to investing, to parenting.
