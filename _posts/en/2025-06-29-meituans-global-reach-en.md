translated: false
type: note
---

Meituan, a leading Chinese tech company, has ventured into international markets with its food delivery platform KeeTa, starting in Hong Kong and expanding to Saudi Arabia, with plans for the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, and Brazil. Below is an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of Meituan operating internationally as a Chinese team, with a focus on KeeTa, and whether a non-diverse team can perform effectively in international markets.

### Advantages of Meituan Operating Internationally

1. **Proven Operational Expertise**:
   - Meituan dominates China’s food delivery market with over 65% market share and 680 million annual transacting users. Its expertise in logistics, supply chain management, and algorithm-driven operations allows it to optimize delivery times and customer experience, as seen in KeeTa’s 30-minute delivery promise in Saudi Arabia compared to the local average of one hour. This operational efficiency is a significant advantage in competitive international markets.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meituan)[](https://equalocean.com/news/2024092921132)[](https://www.statista.com/topics/10872/meituan/)

2. **Scalable Technology and AI Investments**:
   - Meituan’s heavy investment in AI and algorithms enhances operational efficiency, reduces costs, and improves customer personalization. For example, its AI-powered platform supports diverse services like food delivery, ride-sharing, and merchant analytics, which can be adapted to international markets. This tech-driven approach gives Meituan a competitive edge in scaling KeeTa globally.[](https://www.deciphr.ai/podcast/meituan)[](https://leadiq.com/c/meituan/5a1d7ee0240000240059e053)

3. **Aggressive Market Entry Strategies**:
   - Meituan employs high subsidies and promotions, such as 50% off coupons and free delivery in Saudi Arabia, to capture market share quickly. In Hong Kong, KeeTa achieved a 44% market share within a year, surpassing competitors like FoodPanda. This strategy leverages Meituan’s financial strength to establish a foothold in new markets.[](https://equalocean.com/news/2024092921132)[](https://kr-asia.com/what-signals-has-meituan-sent-with-its-largest-organizational-overhaul-in-six-years)

4. **Experience in High-Density Markets**:
   - Meituan’s success in China’s dense urban environments, with 20 million daily orders, equips it to handle similar high-demand markets abroad, such as Hong Kong or Riyadh. Its ability to manage high transaction volumes and logistics networks is a key strength.[](https://jefftowson.com/membership_content/geographic-density-and-how-meituan-finally-became-profitable-tech-strategy-daily-article/)

5. **Strategic Expansion into Emerging Markets**:
   - Meituan targets markets like Saudi Arabia and Brazil, where demand for on-demand delivery is high and competition is less entrenched than in developed markets. For instance, Saudi Arabia’s favorable policies and underdeveloped delivery infrastructure provide growth opportunities. Partnerships, like the investment memorandum with Brazil, further support sustainable operations.[](https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/meituans-keeta-will-expand-into-uae-qatar-and-kuwait-says-founder-wang-xing/)[](https://kr-asia.com/meituans-xiaoxiang-supermarket-makes-global-debut-starting-in-saudi-arabia)

### Disadvantages of Meituan Operating Internationally

1. **Cultural and Regulatory Challenges**:
   - Operating in diverse markets like Saudi Arabia requires adherence to local customs, such as Halal certification for food, which increases compliance costs. Social and cultural differences, like managing nighttime staffing during Ramadan, add operational complexity. These challenges can strain Meituan’s resources and require significant localization efforts.[](https://equalocean.com/news/2024092921132)

2. **High Localization Costs**:
   - Meituan’s subsidy-driven model, while effective initially, pressures cash flow in the long term. In Saudi Arabia, high operating costs and the need for joint ventures with local entities increase financial burdens. Adapting to local payment systems, languages, and consumer preferences further escalates costs.[](https://equalocean.com/news/2024092921132)[](https://technode.com/2024/04/28/meituan-to-bring-delivery-service-keeta-to-riyadh-following-its-ceos-take-over-of-overseas-business/)

3. **Intense Competition**:
   - In markets like the UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar, established players like Talabat hold over 50–70% market share, making it difficult for KeeTa to gain traction without significant investment. Incumbents like HungerStation and Jahez in Saudi Arabia have responded to KeeTa’s entry with their own promotions, intensifying competition.[](https://kr-asia.com/meituans-next-act-ai-bets-global-reach-and-a-retooled-business-model)

4. **Limited International Experience**:
   - Meituan’s operations have been primarily China-focused, with Hong Kong being its first international venture in 2023. The lack of extensive global experience may hinder its ability to navigate complex international regulations, consumer behaviors, and market dynamics compared to global competitors like Delivery Hero.[](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/04/meituan-keeta-in-hong-kongs-food-delivery-race-analysts-are-skeptical.html)

5. **Dependence on Subsidies**:
   - Meituan’s reliance on heavy subsidies to attract users, as seen in Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia, may not be sustainable. If subsidies are reduced, user retention could falter, especially in price-sensitive markets. This approach also risks diluting profit margins, as seen in Meituan’s domestic challenges.[](https://kr-asia.com/what-signals-has-meituan-sent-with-its-largest-organizational-overhaul-in-six-years)[](https://technode.com/2024/04/28/meituan-to-bring-delivery-service-keeta-to-riyadh-following-its-ceos-take-over-of-overseas-business/)

### Impact of a Non-Diverse Team on International Performance

A non-diverse team, primarily composed of Chinese employees, may face both opportunities and challenges in performing effectively in international markets:

#### Advantages of a Non-Diverse Team
- **Cohesive Strategy Execution**: A non-diverse team with shared cultural and operational backgrounds can execute Meituan’s proven China-based strategies efficiently. For example, the Xiaoxiang Supermarket expansion in Saudi Arabia is led by a team of Meituan veterans from its domestic operations, ensuring alignment with the company’s core competencies.[](https://kr-asia.com/meituans-xiaoxiang-supermarket-makes-global-debut-starting-in-saudi-arabia)
- **Deep Knowledge of Meituan’s Systems**: A team familiar with Meituan’s algorithms, logistics, and business model can quickly deploy and adapt these systems abroad, as seen with KeeTa’s rapid market share gains in Hong Kong. This reduces the learning curve and ensures operational consistency.[](https://equalocean.com/news/2024092921132)[](https://kr-asia.com/what-signals-has-meituan-sent-with-its-largest-organizational-overhaul-in-six-years)
- **Streamlined Decision-Making**: A non-diverse team may have fewer cultural or communication barriers internally, enabling faster decision-making, which is critical in competitive markets where speed is a differentiator, such as KeeTa’s 30-minute delivery promise.[](https://equalocean.com/news/2024092921132)

#### Disadvantages of a Non-Diverse Team
- **Limited Cultural Understanding**: A non-diverse team may struggle to understand local consumer preferences, cultural nuances, and regulatory requirements. For instance, in Saudi Arabia, the need for Halal certification and localized marketing strategies requires cultural sensitivity that a predominantly Chinese team may lack, potentially leading to missteps.[](https://equalocean.com/news/2024092921132)
- **Challenges in Building Local Partnerships**: International expansion often requires joint ventures and relationships with local entities, as noted in Saudi Arabia’s high entry barriers. A non-diverse team may face difficulties in building trust and navigating local business networks due to cultural and language differences.[](https://equalocean.com/news/2024092921132)[](https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/meituans-keeta-will-expand-into-uae-qatar-and-kuwait-says-founder-wang-xing/)
- **Risk of Groupthink**: A lack of diversity in perspectives may limit innovation and adaptability, critical for tailoring services to diverse markets. For example, Hong Kong’s high convenience store density required a different strategy than Saudi Arabia’s, and a non-diverse team may struggle to identify such nuances.[](https://kr-asia.com/meituans-xiaoxiang-supermarket-makes-global-debut-starting-in-saudi-arabia)
- **Workforce Diversity Gaps**: Meituan’s limited disclosures on workforce diversity, such as gender or cultural representation, suggest a lack of focus on inclusivity. This could hinder its ability to attract and retain talent in international markets, where diverse teams are often better equipped to understand local consumers.[](https://www.worldbenchmarkingalliance.org/publication/digital-inclusion/companies/meituan-2/)

#### Can a Non-Diverse Team Perform Well Internationally?
A non-diverse team can perform well in the short term by leveraging Meituan’s operational strengths and executing a standardized strategy, as demonstrated by KeeTa’s success in Hong Kong (44% market share in one year). However, long-term success in diverse markets like Saudi Arabia, Brazil, or the UAE requires cultural adaptation and local expertise. Without diversity, Meituan risks misjudging local needs, facing regulatory hurdles, or alienating customers. To mitigate this, Meituan has hired Arabic- and English-proficient talent for its Saudi expansion, indicating some effort to bridge cultural gaps.[](https://equalocean.com/news/2024092921132)[](https://technode.com/2024/04/28/meituan-to-bring-delivery-service-keeta-to-riyadh-following-its-ceos-take-over-of-overseas-business/)

For optimal performance, Meituan should balance its core Chinese team with local hires or diverse talent to enhance cultural understanding and innovation. A hybrid approach—retaining operational expertise while integrating local perspectives—would likely yield the best results in navigating the complexities of international markets.

### Conclusion
Meituan’s international expansion through KeeTa benefits from its operational expertise, scalable technology, and aggressive market entry tactics, but it faces challenges from cultural differences, high localization costs, and intense competition. A non-diverse team can execute Meituan’s proven strategies effectively in the short term but may struggle with long-term adaptation due to limited cultural insights and potential groupthink. Incorporating local talent and fostering diversity will be crucial for sustained success in global markets.
