### Fixing the JWT Secret Error in LibreChat

The logs indicate the API is starting but crashing due to a missing JWT secret: `JwtStrategy requires a secret or key`. This is a common setup issue in LibreChat—the backend uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, and without a secret key, it can't initialize the strategy. The RAG API, permissions, and other services are fine, but this blocks the main API from fully starting, preventing access to http://localhost:3080.

#### Quick Fix: Set the JWT_SECRET
1. **Generate a Secure Secret**:
   - Run this command to create a random 32+ character string (use it as your JWT_SECRET):
     ```
     openssl rand -base64 32
     ```
     Example output: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6`

2. **Update Your `.env` File**:
   - Open `.env` (in your LibreChat project root).
   - Add or uncomment this line (replace with your generated secret):
     ```
     JWT_SECRET=your_generated_secret_here
     ```
   - If it's already there but empty/commented, just fill it in.
   - Save the file.

3. **Restart the Services**:
   ```
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   - Watch the logs: `docker logs -f api` (or `docker logs -f librechat_api` if named differently).
   - Look for successful startup without the JWT error. It should log something like "Server running on port 3080".

#### Verify It's Working
- After restart, check running containers:
  ```
  docker ps
  ```
  - The `api` container should be "Up" and expose port 3080.
- Test access: Open http://localhost:3080 in your browser. You should see the LibreChat login/setup page.
- If still issues, tail logs for new errors: `docker logs api`.

#### Other Notes from Logs
- **Outdated Config**: You're on v1.2.1, but v1.3.0 is available. After fixing JWT, review the [changelog](https://www.librechat.ai/changelog) for new features (e.g., better auth options). Update by pulling the latest images: `docker compose pull`.
- **Turnstile Disabled**: Fine for local dev; enable it later for production CAPTCHA.
- **UID/GID Warnings**: If they persist, set them as I mentioned before to avoid future permission hiccups.

This should get you up and running—JWT_SECRET is required for auth endpoints. If logs show a different error post-fix, paste them here.
