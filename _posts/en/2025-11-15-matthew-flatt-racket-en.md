Matthew Flatt is an American computer scientist and professor in the School of Computing at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. He earned his PhD from Rice University in 1999 under the supervision of Matthias Felleisen and is a key developer and leader of the core team for the Racket programming language, a dialect of Scheme known for its use in programming language research and education. His research focuses on extensible programming languages, runtime systems, and applications of functional programming. He has co-authored influential works, including the Revised^6 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme, and contributed to projects like How to Design Programs, Program by Design, and PLT Redex.

In 2018, Flatt received the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Software Award (shared with the Racket team) for Racket's impact on research and education, particularly its macro and module systems. He has over 10,000 citations on Google Scholar and is praised by students for his knowledgeable, fair, and engaging teaching style in courses like CS 3520.
