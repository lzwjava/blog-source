Neil Deaton Jones (1941-2023) was an American computer scientist, widely recognized as a Professor Emeritus in computer science at the University of Copenhagen. His extensive work significantly impacted both programming languages and the theory of computation.

Jones was particularly known for his pioneering contributions to:

* **Partial Evaluation (Program Specialization):** This involves transforming a program with some of its inputs known in advance into a more efficient, specialized version. He was instrumental in making partial evaluation self-applicable and practically useful.
* **Control-Flow Analysis:** A technique for determining the possible paths that a program's execution might take, crucial for program optimization and understanding.
* **Size-Change Termination Analysis:** A method for proving that programs will eventually halt, a fundamental problem in computer science.
* **Theory of Computation and Complexity:** He was a pioneer in the study of log-space reductions and P-completeness, and his work helped bridge the gap between theoretical computer science and practical programming. He explored the computational complexity of various systems and problems, including those related to L-systems and finite state automata. His book, "Computability and Complexity: From a Programming Perspective," aims to make these concepts more accessible to programmers.

His influence extended to establishing the Theory and Practice of Programming Languages (TOPPS) research group at the University of Copenhagen. For his profound impact, he was recognized as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1998 and received the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Achievement Award in 2014. He was also awarded the Knight of the Dannebrog Order by the Queen of Denmark in 1998.
