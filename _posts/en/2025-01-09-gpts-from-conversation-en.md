title: ChatGPT Should Allow Creation of GPTs from Conversation History
translated: false
---

The conversation list should include a button near the share button labeled "Create GPT." This feature would allow users to create a GPT based on recent chat history.

Users can specify a number to indicate how many of the last messages in the conversation should be used to create the GPT.

This would allow users to easily define custom GPTs based on their conversation history, such as "Fix the grammar," "Refine the post," or "Translate to English."
