"Doujiang" (豆浆, pronounced "doh-jyahng") is the Mandarin Chinese term for **soy milk**, a beverage made by grinding soaked soybeans, boiling the mixture, and straining out the solids. It's a staple in Chinese breakfasts, often served hot or cold, sweet (with sugar) or savory (as a slightly curdled soup with vinegar or ginger). The casual "soybean juice" description you mentioned is a fun, informal way to think of it, but "soy milk" is the standard English translation.

It's commonly paired with youtiao (fried dough sticks) for dipping. In Western contexts, it's similar to store-bought soy milk but often fresher and more watery when homemade.
