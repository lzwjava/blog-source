## 1. Number Systems

### 1.1 Binary Number System

**Concepts:**

- **Base-2 System:** Uses only two digits: 0 and 1.
- **Place Value:** Each digit represents a power of 2. For a binary number \\( b_n b_{n-1} \dots b_1 b_0 \\), the value is  
  \\[
  \sum_{i=0}^{n} b_i \times 2^i
  \\]
  where \\( b_i \\) is either 0 or 1.

**Example:**

Convert binary \\( 1011_2 \\) to decimal:
- \\( 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11_{10} \\)

**Practice Exercise:**

- Convert the binary number \\( 110010_2 \\) to decimal.

---

### 1.2 Hexadecimal Number System

**Concepts:**

- **Base-16 System:** Uses sixteen symbols: 0–9 and A–F (where A=10, B=11, …, F=15).
- **Place Value:** Each digit represents a power of 16. For a hexadecimal number \\( h_n h_{n-1} \dots h_1 h_0 \\), the value is  
  \\[
  \sum_{i=0}^{n} h_i \times 16^i
  \\]

**Conversion from Binary to Hexadecimal:**

1. Group the binary number into 4-bit chunks (starting from the right).
2. Convert each 4-bit group to its hexadecimal equivalent.

**Example:**

Convert binary \\( 1011011101_2 \\) to hexadecimal:
- Group into 4-bit groups: \\( 10 \, 1101 \, 1101 \\) (pad left with zeros if needed → \\( 0010 \, 1101 \, 1101 \\))
- \\( 0010_2 = 2_{16} \\)
- \\( 1101_2 = D_{16} \\)
- \\( 1101_2 = D_{16} \\)
- Final hexadecimal: \\( 2DD_{16} \\)

**Practice Exercise:**

- Convert the binary number \\( 11101010_2 \\) into hexadecimal.

### 1.3 Floating-Point Number Representation

**Concepts:**

- **Purpose:** To represent real numbers that can have very large or very small magnitudes.
- **IEEE Standard:** Most computers use IEEE 754 for floating-point arithmetic.
- **Components:**
  - **Sign Bit:** Determines if the number is positive (0) or negative (1).
  - **Exponent:** Represents the scale or magnitude.
  - **Mantissa (Significand):** Contains the significant digits of the number.

**Representation:**

For single precision (32-bit):
- 1 bit for sign.
- 8 bits for exponent.
- 23 bits for mantissa.

For example, the value is represented as:
\\[
(-1)^{\text{sign}} \times 1.\text{mantissa} \times 2^{(\text{exponent} - \text{bias})}
\\]
where the bias for single precision is 127.

**Example Walk-Through:**

Suppose you have a 32-bit binary string representing a floating-point number:
- **Sign Bit:** 0 (positive)
- **Exponent Bits:** e.g., \\( 10000010_2 \\) → Decimal 130. Subtract bias: \\( 130 - 127 = 3 \\).
- **Mantissa Bits:** Suppose they represent a fractional part like \\( .101000... \\).

Then the number would be:
\\[
+1.101000 \times 2^3
\\]
Convert \\( 1.101000 \\) from binary to decimal and then multiply by \\( 2^3 \\) to get the final value.

**Practice Exercise:**

- Given the following breakdown for a 32-bit floating-point number: sign = 0, exponent = \\( 10000001_2 \\) (decimal 129), and mantissa = \\( 01000000000000000000000 \\), compute the decimal value.

## 2. Boolean Algebra

### 2.1 Basic Boolean Operations

**Key Operations:**
- **AND (·):** \\( A \land B \\) is true only if both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are true.
- **OR (+):** \\( A \lor B \\) is true if at least one of \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) is true.
- **NOT (’ or \\(\neg\\)):** \\( \neg A \\) inverts the truth value of \\( A \\).

**Truth Tables:**

- **AND:**

  | A | B | A AND B |
  |---|---|---------|
  | 0 | 0 | 0       |
  | 0 | 1 | 0       |
  | 1 | 0 | 0       |
  | 1 | 1 | 1       |

- **OR:**

  | A | B | A OR B |
  |---|---|--------|
  | 0 | 0 | 0      |
  | 0 | 1 | 1      |
  | 1 | 0 | 1      |
  | 1 | 1 | 1      |

- **NOT:**

  | A | NOT A |
  |---|-------|
  | 0 | 1     |
  | 1 | 0     |

**Practice Exercise:**

- Given the Boolean expression \\( \neg(A \land B) \\), use a truth table to show it is equivalent to \\( \neg A \lor \neg B \\) (De Morgan’s Law).

### 2.2 Boolean Algebra Laws and Theorems

**Important Laws:**

- **Commutative Law:**
  - \\( A \lor B = B \lor A \\)
  - \\( A \land B = B \land A \\)

- **Associative Law:**
  - \\( (A \lor B) \lor C = A \lor (B \lor C) \\)
  - \\( (A \land B) \land C = A \land (B \land C) \\)

- **Distributive Law:**
  - \\( A \land (B \lor C) = (A \land B) \lor (A \land C) \\)
  - \\( A \lor (B \land C) = (A \lor B) \land (A \lor C) \\)

- **De Morgan’s Laws:**
  - \\( \neg (A \land B) = \neg A \lor \neg B \\)
  - \\( \neg (A \lor B) = \neg A \land \neg B \\)

**Practice Exercise:**

- Simplify the expression \\( A \lor (\neg A \land B) \\) using Boolean algebra laws.

## 3. Arithmetic Operations in Different Number Systems

### 3.1 Binary Arithmetic

**Key Operations:**

- **Addition:**
  - Follows similar rules to decimal addition but with base 2.
  - **Example:** \\( 1011_2 + 1101_2 \\)
    - Align and add bit by bit, carrying over when the sum exceeds 1.

- **Subtraction:**
  - Can be performed by borrowing, or by using the two's complement method.
  - **Two's Complement:** To represent negative numbers, invert the bits and add 1.
  - **Example:** To subtract \\( 1101_2 \\) from \\( 1011_2 \\), first find the two's complement of \\( 1101_2 \\) then add.

**Practice Exercise:**

- Perform the binary subtraction \\( 10100_2 - 01101_2 \\) using two’s complement.

### 3.2 Hexadecimal Arithmetic

**Key Operations:**

- **Addition/Subtraction:** Similar to decimal arithmetic but in base-16.
- **Multiplication/Division:** Also follows the same principles as in decimal; however, you need to convert intermediate results using hexadecimal rules.

**Practice Exercise:**

- Add \\( 2A3_{16} \\) and \\( 1F7_{16} \\).

---

### 3.3 Floating-Point Arithmetic

**Challenges:**

- **Rounding Errors:** Due to limited precision, operations may introduce rounding errors.
- **Normalization:** After an operation, the result must be normalized (i.e., the mantissa adjusted so that it fits the required format).

**Example:**

- **Addition:** When adding two floating-point numbers, you must align the exponents before adding the mantissas.

**Practice Exercise:**

- Outline the steps to add two floating-point numbers represented in IEEE 754 format.

## 4. Practical Tips for Mastering the Material

- **Work Through Examples:** Practice converting numbers between systems by hand.
- **Build Truth Tables:** For Boolean expressions, construct truth tables to understand and verify equivalences.
- **Use Simulators/Tools:** Many educational websites and software tools allow you to simulate binary arithmetic or IEEE floating-point operations.
- **Practice Problems:** Look for exercises at the end of your textbook chapters or online problem sets related to computer organization.
- **Understand the Theory:** Rather than memorizing steps, focus on understanding why a method (like two’s complement) works.
