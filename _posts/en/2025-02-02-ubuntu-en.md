I previously wrote about [How to Build a Computer](./computer-en). Let's try something different. Today, I'm installing Ubuntu 24.04 on a Lenovo Xiaoxing 14IAH8 laptop that came with Windows 10 pre-installed.

```bash
sudo dd if=ubuntu-24.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/rdisk6 bs=1m
```

It is necessary to go to settings and disable Device encryption, as the Ubuntu installer requires it.

If device encryption is enabled and secure boot is disabled in the BIOS, Windows will prompt for the BitLocker passphrase for recovery.

Therefore, it's necessary to first enable secure boot in the BIOS, log into Windows, and then go to settings to disable Device encryption. After that, secure boot can be disabled again to start the Ubuntu installer.
