title: Vertical Mouse Ergonomic Benefits Explained

Here are the actual ergonomic benefits of a true vertical mouse (like the B.O.W M190U Pro, Anker, Logitech MX Vertical, etc.) — explained simply and with the real-world differences people feel:

| Benefit | What actually changes | Why it helps | How much difference most people notice (Taiwan user reports) |
|---------|-----------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Neutral wrist position (0° pronation) | Your hand is in a “handshake” position instead of palm-down. Forearm bones are no longer crossed/twisted. | Eliminates the main cause of forearm/wrist strain (pronation). This is the single biggest RSI reducer. | 80–90 % of long-term users say wrist pain disappears or drops 70–90 % within 1–2 months |
| Reduced ulnar deviation | Thumb points upward naturally → no need to bend wrist sideways to reach buttons. | Less stress on the pinky-side of the wrist (common pain spot for Taiwanese who use small desks). | Very noticeable if you have “mouse elbow” or pinky-side soreness |
| Lower extensor muscle activity | Forearm extensor muscles (top of forearm) work ~30–50 % less (proven in EMG studies). | Less fatigue after 8+ hour workdays; many programmers/office workers in Taiwan say “手臂不會酸了”. | Felt clearly after 4–6 hours of continuous use |
| Better shoulder posture | Because the mouse is taller, your elbow naturally stays closer to your body instead of “chicken-winging” out. | Reduces shoulder and neck tension (common complaint when using flat mice on high desks). | Obvious if you already have rounded shoulders or neck pain from desk work |
| Less pressure on carpal tunnel | Palm is supported, not resting on the desk → less direct compression on the median nerve. | Big help for people who already have mild carpal tunnel or tingling fingers. | Many PTT/Mobile01 users with early carpal tunnel symptoms report numbness gone in 2–4 weeks |

Real-life summary from Taiwanese users (PTT, Mobile01, Dcard 2023–2025 posts):
- Most common: “滑鼠手完全不痛了” (mouse-hand pain completely gone)
- Second most common: “肩膀放鬆很多，不會聳肩了” (shoulders much more relaxed)
- About 10 % still complain it’s not precise enough for Photoshop/gaming, but 90 % of office/programming users say the comfort is worth it once they pass the 2–3 week adaptation period.

In short: A good vertical mouse doesn’t just feel “different” — it removes the root biomechanical cause of most mouse-related wrist/forearm pain. That’s why physical therapists and hand surgeons almost always recommend them first when someone shows up with RSI or mouse-arm pain.
