Choosing the best Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing Rust often depends on your specific needs, such as ease of use, integration with tools, and personal preference. Here are some popular options:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with Rust Analyzer:

Pros: Lightweight, highly customizable, and has a strong extension ecosystem. The Rust Analyzer extension provides excellent support for Rust, including code completion, linting, and debugging.
Cons: Might require more setup compared to full-fledged IDEs.
IntelliJ IDEA with the IntelliJ Rust Plugin:

Pros: Offers a rich set of features out of the box, including advanced code analysis and refactoring tools. Good for developers already familiar with the IntelliJ ecosystem.
Cons: Can be resource-intensive and slower compared to lighter editors.
CLion with the IntelliJ Rust Plugin:

Pros: Similar to IntelliJ IDEA but tailored for C and C++ development, which can also be beneficial for Rust development. Offers powerful debugging and code analysis tools.
Cons: Also resource-intensive and might be overkill for simple projects.
Sublime Text with LSP-Rust:

Pros: Very fast and lightweight, suitable for quick edits and smaller projects.
Cons: Lacks some of the deeper integration and tooling support found in other IDEs.
Atom with ide-rust:

Pros: Open-source and customizable, with a community-driven package ecosystem.
Cons: Slower performance compared to some other editors, and development has been deprecated by GitHub.
Eclipse with the Corrosion Plugin:

Pros: Familiar environment for those already using Eclipse for other languages.
Cons: Setup can be complex, and it may not be as feature-rich as other options.
For many Rust developers, Visual Studio Code with the Rust Analyzer extension is a popular choice due to its balance of performance, ease of use, and powerful features. However, the best IDE for you will depend on your specific workflow and preferences.
