### Major Airports in Hong Kong and Macau

#### Hong Kong
- **Hong Kong International Airport (HKG)**: The primary international airport, located on Chek Lap Kok Island. It serves as the main hub for the region, handling most commercial flights.

#### Macau
- **Macau International Airport (MFM)**: The only major airport, situated on Taipa Island. It primarily serves regional international flights and is a key gateway for tourists.

These are the two primary airports; Hong Kong's Shek Kong Airfield is mainly military and not for commercial use.
