Benjamin Franklin (January 17, 1706 – April 17, 1790) was a polymath and one of the most influential Founding Fathers of the United States. His contributions spanned science, politics, diplomacy, literature, and invention, leaving a lasting legacy on American society and beyond. Known for his wit, pragmatism, and insatiable curiosity, Franklin embodied the Enlightenment ideals of reason, inquiry, and civic responsibility. Below is a comprehensive introduction to his life, achievements, and impact.

### Early Life and Education
Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Franklin was the 15th of 17 children in a modest family. His father, Josiah Franklin, was a candle and soap maker, and his mother, Abiah Folger, was Josiah’s second wife. Franklin’s formal education was limited to two years, ending at age 10, due to financial constraints. However, he was an avid reader and largely self-educated, devouring books on diverse subjects. At 12, he was apprenticed to his older brother James, a printer, where he honed his writing and printing skills. This early exposure to the printing trade shaped his future as a publisher and communicator.

In 1723, at 17, Franklin ran away to Philadelphia, seeking independence after clashing with his brother. Philadelphia became his lifelong home, where he established himself as a printer and entrepreneur.

### Career as a Printer and Publisher
Franklin’s printing business flourished, making him one of the most successful publishers in the colonies. He ran the *Pennsylvania Gazette* (1729–1776), a leading newspaper known for its lively content and Franklin’s witty editorials. He also published *Poor Richard’s Almanack* (1732–1757) under the pseudonym Richard Saunders, which became wildly popular for its practical advice, proverbs, and humor. Aphorisms like “Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise” remain iconic.

Through his printing ventures, Franklin built a network across the colonies, fostering communication and ideas. His business acumen allowed him to retire from active printing in 1748 at age 42, freeing him to focus on science, politics, and public service.

### Scientific Contributions
Franklin was a leading scientist of his era, particularly in the field of electricity. His experiments in the 1740s and 1750s, including the famous kite experiment (1752), demonstrated that lightning was a form of electricity. This work led to the invention of the lightning rod, a practical device that protected buildings from lightning strikes. His studies earned him international acclaim, including membership in the Royal Society of London and an honorary degree from the University of St. Andrews, where he was dubbed “Dr. Franklin.”

Beyond electricity, Franklin invented practical devices like the Franklin stove (a fuel-efficient heating system), bifocal glasses, and a flexible urinary catheter. He also made contributions to meteorology, oceanography (mapping the Gulf Stream), and demography, reflecting his wide-ranging curiosity. Notably, Franklin never patented his inventions, believing they should benefit society freely.

### Political and Civic Leadership
Franklin’s civic contributions began in Philadelphia, where he founded institutions that shaped public life. In 1727, he established the Junto, a club for intellectual discussion and civic improvement. His initiatives included the Library Company of Philadelphia (1731), America’s first lending library; the American Philosophical Society (1743), a hub for scientific inquiry; and the University of Pennsylvania (founded as the Academy of Philadelphia in 1740). He also organized Philadelphia’s first volunteer fire brigade and improved the city’s postal system as deputy postmaster.

Politically, Franklin rose to prominence in Pennsylvania, serving as a clerk and later a member of the Pennsylvania Assembly. Initially loyal to the British Crown, he represented colonial interests in London (1757–1762 and 1764–1775) as an agent for several colonies. His experiences in Britain, including witnessing colonial grievances and British arrogance, gradually turned him toward advocating for American rights. By the time he returned to America in 1775, Franklin was a committed patriot.

### Role in the American Revolution
Franklin was a key figure in the American Revolution. In 1775, he joined the Continental Congress and helped draft the Declaration of Independence in 1776, contributing to its clarity and tone at age 70. His diplomatic skills shone as America’s minister to France (1776–1785), where he secured critical French support—military aid, loans, and troops—that proved decisive in the war against Britain. His charm, humor, and strategic acumen made him a celebrity in France, where he was hailed as a symbol of American virtue.

After the war, Franklin helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended the Revolutionary War and recognized American independence. Returning to America, he attended the Constitutional Convention in 1787, advocating for compromise and a balanced government. Though he did not fully endorse the final Constitution (due to concerns like the lack of term limits), his support lent it credibility.

### Personal Life and Character
Franklin married Deborah Read in 1730, and they had two children: Francis (who died young) and Sarah. He also had an illegitimate son, William, from an earlier relationship, whom he raised. William became royal governor of New Jersey but remained loyal to Britain during the Revolution, straining their relationship. Deborah managed the household and business during Franklin’s long absences, though their marriage was pragmatic rather than deeply romantic.

Franklin’s personality was marked by wit, pragmatism, and a knack for self-improvement. His *Autobiography* (written in stages, published posthumously) details his rise from humble beginnings and outlines his famous 13 virtues, a system for moral self-discipline. While not overtly religious, he embraced a practical deism, believing in a benevolent deity and the value of good works. His humor and accessibility made him beloved, though critics noted his occasional opportunism and complex personal life.

### Views on Slavery and Later Years
Franklin’s views on slavery evolved. Early in life, he owned and profited from enslaved people, as was common among colonial elites. By the 1760s, influenced by Enlightenment ideas and abolitionist friends, he began questioning slavery. In his final years, as president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society (1787–1790), he petitioned Congress to end slavery, calling it inconsistent with American ideals. His late activism, though limited by his era, marked a significant shift.

Franklin spent his final years in Philadelphia, battling health issues like gout and kidney stones. He died on April 17, 1790, at 84. His funeral drew 20,000 mourners, reflecting his immense popularity.

### Legacy and Impact
Franklin’s legacy is vast. As a Founding Father, he helped shape the United States’ political foundations. His scientific work advanced human understanding and practical technology. His writings, especially *Poor Richard’s Almanack* and his *Autobiography*, remain literary classics, offering insights into colonial life and self-improvement. His civic institutions, like libraries and universities, set precedents for public welfare.

Franklin’s image as a self-made man, inventor, and patriot endures in American culture, symbolized by his face on the $100 bill. However, his complexities—his initial acceptance of slavery, his pragmatic politics, and his personal contradictions—add depth to his story. He remains a quintessential figure of the Enlightenment and a cornerstone of American identity.
