### Liu Weipeng's Blog on Psychology

Liu Weipeng's blog at mindhacks.cn (now largely archived, with key content compiled into his book *Dark Time*) integrates psychology deeply with practical advice on thinking, learning, and productivity. Drawing from cognitive science, neuroscience, and behavioral psychology, he explores how the mind processes information during everyday "dark time"—those unstructured moments like commuting or waiting in line that most people waste but can repurpose for deep reflection and growth. His approach is non-academic: reflective essays blending personal anecdotes, scientific insights, and actionable "hacks" aimed at programmers and lifelong learners. Psychology isn't treated as abstract theory but as a toolkit for hacking your own cognition to achieve better focus, memory, and decision-making.

#### Key Psychological Themes and Ideas
- **Dark Time and Reflective Thinking**: Liu argues that true cognitive advancement happens in "invisible" time slots, where the brain consolidates knowledge subconsciously. This draws on psychological concepts like incubation (from creativity research) and default mode network activity in neuroscience, where mind-wandering fosters problem-solving. He emphasizes training concentration through deliberate mental exercises, warning that without it, people fall into reactive habits. For example, he suggests using fragmented moments to rehearse ideas, turning passive waiting into active neural rewiring.

- **Effective Learning and Memory**: Influenced by cognitive psychology (e.g., Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve), Liu advocates spaced repetition and active recall over passive rereading. Learning's success is measured not by input (hours studied) but output (recall under pressure). He critiques cramming as illusory competence and promotes "deliberate practice" from Anders Ericsson's work—focused, feedback-driven repetition that builds expertise. A standout hack: Test yourself immediately after reading to encode knowledge deeply, leveraging the testing effect for long-term retention.

- **Cognitive Biases and Decision-Making**: Posts dissect biases like confirmation bias and the illusion of explanatory depth, applying them to programming pitfalls (e.g., overconfidence in buggy code). He ties this to Daniel Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, urging readers to slow down System 1 (intuitive) thinking for System 2 (analytical) rigor, especially in high-stakes problem-solving.

- **Flow, Motivation, and Habit Formation**: Borrowing from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory, Liu describes optimal states where challenge matches skill, boosting intrinsic motivation. He discusses habit loops from Charles Duhigg, advising small, consistent rituals to combat procrastination. Psychology here serves productivity: Understand dopamine rewards to design self-reinforcing behaviors, like gamifying mundane tasks with progress bars (rooted in perceptual psychology to reduce perceived wait times).

- **Reading and Knowledge Acquisition**: In essays like "How to Read a Book," he applies Mortimer Adler's methods with a psychological twist—layered reading (survey, analytic, syntopic) to minimize cognitive load and maximize comprehension. He stresses emotional engagement: Curiosity drives encoding, per affective neuroscience.

Overall, Liu's take is optimistic yet pragmatic: Psychology reveals the mind's flaws (e.g., limited working memory) but equips us to bypass them. His writing demystifies the brain, showing how small mindset shifts yield compound gains, much like compound interest in finance. The blog's influence stems from this blend—technical depth without jargon, inspiring readers to treat their cognition as debuggable software.

For deeper dives, the full *Dark Time* (2nd edition) compiles 38 blog essays, many psychology-centric.
