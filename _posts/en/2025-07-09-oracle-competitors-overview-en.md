Oracle's major competitors vary by product area, but here are the key ones:

**Database Management:**
- Microsoft SQL Server
- IBM DB2
- MySQL (ironically, Oracle owns this but it competes with their commercial offerings)
- PostgreSQL
- Amazon RDS and Aurora
- MongoDB

**Cloud Infrastructure:**
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the dominant player
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform
- IBM Cloud

**Enterprise Software:**
- SAP (major competitor in ERP and business applications)
- Microsoft (Dynamics, Office 365)
- Salesforce (CRM and cloud applications)
- Workday (HR and financial management)

**Java and Development Tools:**
- Microsoft (.NET framework and Visual Studio)
- IBM (WebSphere and development tools)
- Various open-source alternatives

AWS is probably Oracle's biggest overall competitive threat since they dominate cloud computing, while SAP remains their primary rival in enterprise applications. Microsoft competes across multiple Oracle product lines, making them another major competitor.

The competitive landscape has shifted significantly toward cloud-first companies like AWS and Microsoft, putting pressure on Oracle's traditional on-premises software model.
