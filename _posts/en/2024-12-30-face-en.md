title: Social Networks Should Offer Face Detection Filters
translated: false
type: post

Recently, I visited someone's profile on X and browsed through her media. Despite scrolling extensively, I couldn't find any photos featuring her face. This experience highlighted the need for a filtering option to easily locate media containing faces. I remembered she had posted a selfie before, but with so many posts, her photos were buried deep in her history.

Ideally, there should be two filtering options: one for viewing all media and another for viewing only photos that include faces. Many users are particularly interested in photos featuring faces, and since these media are already public, adding such a filter would enhance the user experience without compromising privacy.

This feature would be beneficial not just for X, but for all social media platforms, including WeChat, Weibo, Instagram, Facebook, and Threads. Implementing a face detection filter would make it easier for users to find the content they are most interested in.
