Basketball statistics provide a numerical way to evaluate a player's or team's performance. Here's a breakdown of common terms you'll encounter:

## Basic (Per Game) Statistics:

These are usually presented as "per game" averages, indicated by the "PG" suffix.

* **PPG (Points Per Game):** The average number of points a player scores per game. This is the most straightforward measure of a player's scoring ability.
* **GP (Games Played):** The total number of games a player has participated in during a season or their career.
* **GS (Games Started):** The number of games a player has started, indicating if they are a regular in the starting lineup.
* **MPG (Minutes Per Game):** The average number of minutes a player spends on the court per game.
* **RPG (Rebounds Per Game):** The average number of rebounds a player grabs per game. Rebounds are when a player gains possession of the ball after a missed shot.
    * **OREB (Offensive Rebounds):** Rebounds grabbed by a player's *own* team after one of their missed shots, giving them another scoring opportunity.
    * **DREB (Defensive Rebounds):** Rebounds grabbed by a player's *opposing* team after a missed shot, ending the opponent's possession.
* **APG (Assists Per Game):** The average number of assists a player makes per game. An assist is a pass that leads directly to a teammate scoring a field goal.
* **SPG (Steals Per Game):** The average number of steals a player gets per game. A steal is when a defensive player takes the ball away from an offensive player.
* **BPG (Blocks Per Game):** The average number of blocks a player gets per game. A block is when a defensive player deflects an opponent's shot, preventing it from going into the basket.
* **TOV (Turnovers):** The number of times a player or team loses possession of the ball through their own fault (e.g., bad pass, traveling, offensive foul).

## Shooting Percentages:

These indicate a player's efficiency in scoring.

* **FG% (Field Goal Percentage):** The percentage of made field goals (2-point and 3-point shots) out of the total attempted. Formula: (Field Goals Made / Field Goals Attempted) x 100.
* **3P% (Three-Point Percentage):** The percentage of made three-point field goals out of the total attempted. Formula: (Three-Point Field Goals Made / Three-Point Field Goals Attempted) x 100.
* **FT% (Free Throw Percentage):** The percentage of made free throws out of the total attempted. Formula: (Free Throws Made / Free Throws Attempted) x 100.

## Other Important Terms:

* **FGM/FGA (Field Goals Made/Attempted):** The number of field goals a player has made versus the number they have attempted. Often shown as "10-20 FG" meaning 10 made shots out of 20 attempted.
* **3PM/3PA (Three-Point Field Goals Made/Attempted):** Similar to FGM/FGA, but specifically for three-point shots.
* **FTM/FTA (Free Throws Made/Attempted):** Similar to FGM/FGA, but specifically for free throws.
* **+/- (Plus/Minus):** This statistic measures the point differential of a team when a particular player is on the court. A positive plus/minus means the team outscored the opponent while that player was playing, while a negative means they were outscored. It's a way to gauge a player's overall impact.
* **DD (Double-Double):** When a player records double-digits (10 or more) in two different statistical categories in a single game (e.g., 20 points and 12 rebounds).
* **TD (Triple-Double):** When a player records double-digits in three different statistical categories in a single game (e.g., 20 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists). These are less common and highlight a player's versatility.
* **Quadruple-Double:** Extremely rare, when a player records double-digits in four different statistical categories.

## Advanced Statistics (More Complex):

These metrics aim to provide a deeper understanding of player and team performance beyond simple counting stats.

* **EFF (Efficiency):** A composite statistic that attempts to sum up a player's overall contribution. The exact formula can vary, but a common one is: (Points + Rebounds + Assists + Steals + Blocks) - (Turnovers + Missed Field Goals + Missed Free Throws).
* **PER (Player Efficiency Rating):** Developed by John Hollinger, this is a per-minute rating that attempts to quantify a player's per-minute production while adjusting for pace.
* **TS% (True Shooting Percentage):** A more accurate shooting efficiency metric that accounts for the value of 3-pointers and free throws. Formula: PTS / (2 * (FGA + 0.44 * FTA)).
* **eFG% (Effective Field Goal Percentage):** Adjusts regular field goal percentage to give more credit for 3-point shots, as they are worth more points. Formula: (FGM + 0.5 * 3PM) / FGA.
* **Usage % (USG%):** An estimate of the percentage of team possessions a player uses while they are on the floor.

Understanding these terms allows for a more comprehensive analysis of basketball games and player performances.
