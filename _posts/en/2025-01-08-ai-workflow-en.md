title: New Platforms Powered by AI Workflows
translated: false

- Workflows are systems where large language models (LLMs) and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.[^1]

- Imagine a new platform, like TikTok or Quora, X, Threads, Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, or YouTube, fully powered by AI translation.

- Every post or answer created by users can be saved in a single language. The platform will automatically translate content into 20 languages, allowing users to view it in their preferred language.

- Beyond translation, other AI-powered features, such as summarization, audio generation, and video generation, will play a key role. Essentially, the user submits prompt context, and the platform handles the rest.

- Users can upload text, images, audio, or videos, and the platform will automatically convert the content into other formats. Users can decide how they wish to receive that content (e.g., as text, images, audio, or video).

- Platforms can automatically generate summaries, with different types of summarization available in multiple languages.

- In any text, image, audio, or video on the platform, AI can assist in generating, refining, enhancing, fixing, summarizing, expanding, converting to other formats, or imagining new forms of the content.

- Users can customize the platform using keywords like "English" or "funny" to adjust the style of AI workflows in platforms like TikTok. Once set, the AI will tailor content accordingly.
