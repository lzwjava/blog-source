title: Using Chokidar for File Watching
translated: false
---

Chokidar is a Node.js library primarily designed for file watching on the server side, so using it directly in the frontend (i.e., in a browser environment) isn’t its typical use case. The browser doesn’t have direct access to the filesystem like Node.js does, which is why Chokidar is more suited for backend or build-time environments. However, if you’re working on a project where you’re using a bundler like Webpack, Vite, or Parcel in a development setup, or if you’re building an Electron app (which combines Node.js with a frontend), you could leverage Chokidar indirectly. Let me clarify how you might approach this based on context.

### Why Chokidar Doesn’t Run Directly in the Browser
- Chokidar relies on Node.js APIs like `fs` (file system) to watch files, which aren’t available in a browser environment.
- Frontend code runs in a sandboxed environment (the browser), where filesystem access is restricted for security reasons.

### Possible Scenarios for Using Chokidar in a "Frontend" Context
Here’s how you might use Chokidar in a way that relates to frontend development:

#### 1. **During Development with a Build Tool**
If you’re asking about using Chokidar to watch files (e.g., for hot reloading or live updates) during frontend development, you’d integrate it into your build process rather than the browser runtime.

Example with a custom Node.js script:
```javascript
const chokidar = require('chokidar');

// Watch for changes in your frontend source files
chokidar.watch('./src/**/*.{html,js,css}').on('all', (event, path) => {
  console.log(event, path);
  // Trigger a rebuild or notify your frontend dev server here
});
```
- **Use Case**: You could pair this with a WebSocket connection to push updates to the browser during development.
- **Tools**: Combine it with something like `esbuild` or a dev server (e.g., Vite already has file watching built-in, but you could customize it with Chokidar).

#### 2. **In an Electron App**
If your "frontend" is part of an Electron application, you can use Chokidar in the main process (Node.js) and communicate changes to the renderer process (frontend).

Example:
```javascript
// main.js (Electron main process)
const { ipcMain } = require('electron');
const chokidar = require('chokidar');

chokidar.watch('./files').on('change', (path) => {
  ipcMain.send('file-changed', path); // Send event to renderer
});
```
```javascript
// renderer.js (Frontend)
const { ipcRenderer } = require('electron');

ipcRenderer.on('file-changed', (event, path) => {
  console.log(`File changed: ${path}`);
  // Update UI accordingly
});
```

#### 3. **Frontend with a Backend Proxy**
If you’re building a web app and want file-watching functionality, you’d run Chokidar on a Node.js backend and send updates to the frontend via WebSockets or Server-Sent Events.

Example (Backend with Express and WebSocket):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const chokidar = require('chokidar');

const app = express();
const server = app.listen(3000);
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

chokidar.watch('./public').on('change', (path) => {
  wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
    if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      client.send(`File changed: ${path}`);
    }
  });
});
```
Frontend (React example):
```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000');
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log(event.data); // "File changed: ..."
  // Update state or UI
};
```

### Installation
To use Chokidar in any of these setups, you’d first install it in your Node.js project:
```bash
npm install chokidar
```

### Key Chokidar Methods
- `chokidar.watch(path, [options])`: Start watching a file or directory.
- Events: `.on('add', callback)`, `.on('change', callback)`, `.on('unlink', callback)`, `.on('all', (event, path) => {})`.
- Options: `{ ignored: /node_modules/, persistent: true }` (customize as needed).

### If You Meant Something Else
If you’re not working with a Node.js environment at all and want file-watching-like behavior purely in the browser (e.g., watching `<input type="file">` changes), let me know! That would involve the `File` API and event listeners, not Chokidar.
