### Easy Homemade Stuffed Dough Alternatives

If you're looking for simple stuffed dough dishes to make at home besides baozi, buns, and dumplings, focus on options that use store-bought dough (like puff pastry, pie crust, or pizza dough) to keep things quick and beginner-friendly. These savory pastries take 30-60 minutes total and bake or fry easily. Here are five crowd-pleasers with basic steps:
