title: Names in the Translation Output of AI
translated: false
---

In my essays, I often mention Yin Wang. Mistral translates it to Chinese as "王胤", which frustrates me. I prefer it to be translated as "王垠".

Mistral also translates my name, "Li Zhiwei", to "李志伟", but my actual name is "李智维".

I usually write my essays in English first. To avoid these issues, I have to instruct AI chatbots not to translate names. You can specify not to translate Chinese names, as it is common for Chinese texts to include English characters. For Japanese, they use romaji to help translate English words.

This approach is also useful in the translation pipeline. If I use code to have large language models translate text, I need to include these instructions in the prompts.

Additionally, I dislike excessive use of bold type in markdown output, such as **bold**. I find that bold text draws too much attention.

Therefore, I need to study more prompts to customize the AI chatbot to better suit my needs.

I believe this issue is not unique to me; many others likely face the same problem.
