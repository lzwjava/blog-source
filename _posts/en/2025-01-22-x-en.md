There have been many updates to my blog recently. Welcome to visit! One main change is the introduction of 7 more languages: Traditional Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, and Hindi. This is heavily powered by the DeepSeek API.

Today, a nearby print shop is closed because the Spring Festival is approaching. I used the Baibu printing machine in my apartment complex, but the print quality is poor because the text is not continuous. I've started using my Kindle Scribe again for reading. I used pandoc to convert markdown files to EPUB. The command-line tool kindlegen has been replaced by kindlepreviewer, and the current version is 3.90.0. Sometimes, after sending documents to Kindle via email, it reports a problem with the sent document(s). One issue is that the document lacks a title, and to fix it, we need to pass the --metadata parameter.
