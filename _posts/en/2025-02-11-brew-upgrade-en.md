==> Caveats
==> openjdk
For the system Java wrappers to find this JDK, symlink it with
  sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk

openjdk is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS provides similar software and installing this software in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have openjdk first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openjdk you may need to set:
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/include"
==> ruby
By default, binaries installed by gem will be placed into:
  /opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/bin

You may want to add this to your PATH.

ruby is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have ruby first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find ruby you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/include"
==> yt-dlp
zsh completions have been installed to:
  /opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions
==> redis
To restart redis after an upgrade:
  brew services restart redis
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/redis/bin/redis-server /opt/homebrew/etc/redis.conf
==> perl
By default non-brewed cpan modules are installed to the Cellar. If you wish
for your modules to persist across updates we recommend using `local::lib`.

You can set that up like this:
  PERL_MM_OPT="INSTALL_BASE=$HOME/perl5" cpan local::lib
And add the following to your shell profile e.g. ~/.profile or ~/.zshrc
  eval "$(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib=$HOME/perl5)"
==> awscli
The "examples" directory has been installed to:
  /opt/homebrew/share/awscli/examples

zsh completions and functions have been installed to:
  /opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions
==> php
To enable PHP in Apache add the following to httpd.conf and restart Apache:
    LoadModule php_module /opt/homebrew/opt/php/lib/httpd/modules/libphp.so

    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    </FilesMatch>

Finally, check DirectoryIndex includes index.php
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

The php.ini and php-fpm.ini file can be found in:
    /opt/homebrew/etc/php/8.4/

To start php now and restart at login:
  brew services start php
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/php/sbin/php-fpm --nodaemonize
==> nginx
Docroot is: /opt/homebrew/var/www

The default port has been set in /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/servers/.

To restart nginx after an upgrade:
  brew services restart nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/nginx/bin/nginx -g daemon\ off\;
==> git-lfs
Update your git config to finish installation:

  # Update global git config
  $ git lfs install

  # Update system git config
  $ git lfs install --system

zsh completions have been installed to:
  /opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions
==> wireshark
This formula only installs the command-line utilities by default.

Install Wireshark.app with Homebrew Cask:
  brew install --cask wireshark

If your list of available capture interfaces is empty
(default macOS behavior), install ChmodBPF:
  brew install --cask wireshark-chmodbpf
==> doctl
