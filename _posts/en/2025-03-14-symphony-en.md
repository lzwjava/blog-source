### Lyrics of "Symphony" by Clean Bandit featuring Zara Larsson

**Verse 1**  
I've been hearin' symphonies  
Before, all I heard was silence  
A rhapsody for you and me  
And every melody is timeless  
Life was stringin' me along  
Then you came and you cut me loose  
Was solo, singin' on my own  
Now I can't find the key without you  

**Pre-Chorus**  
And now your song is on repeat  
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat  
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete  
So, if you want the truth  

**Chorus**  
I just wanna be part of your symphony  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?  
Symphony  
Like a love song on the radio  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?  

**Verse 2**  
I'm sorry if it's all too much  
Every day you're here, I'm healin'  
And I was runnin' outta luck  
I never thought I'd find this feelin'  
'Cause I've been hearin' symphonies  
Before all I heard was silence  
A rhapsody for you and me  
And every melody is timeless  

**Pre-Chorus**  
And now your song is on repeat  
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat  
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete  
So, if you want the truth  

**Chorus**  
I just wanna be part of your symphony  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?  
Symphony  
Like a love song on the radio  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?  

**Bridge**  
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah  

**Pre-Chorus**  
And now your song is on repeat  
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat  
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete  
So if you want the truth (Oh)  

**Chorus**  
I just wanna be part of your symphony  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?  
Symphony  
Like a love song on the radio  
Symphony  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?  
Symphony  
Like a love song on the radio  
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

### Explanation of "Symphony"

"Symphony" is a love song that uses the metaphor of music to describe the transformative power of love. The lyrics tell the story of someone whose life felt empty and silent before meeting a special person. With their arrival, everything changes—life becomes vibrant and full of harmony, like a symphony. The line "I just wanna be part of your symphony" reflects the longing to be deeply connected to this person, blending into their life like an instrument in a musical composition. The comparison to a "love song on the radio" suggests that this experience of love is both personal and universal, something many can relate to.

The song captures the joy and healing that love brings, with phrases like "every day you’re here, I’m healin’" showing how this relationship restores the singer. It’s a celebration of how love can turn silence into something beautiful and timeless, much like a well-crafted piece of music.
