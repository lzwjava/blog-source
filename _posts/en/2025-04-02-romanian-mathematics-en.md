The Romanian Master of Mathematics (RMM) is a prestigious international mathematics competition for high school students. It is known for its very challenging problems that often require deep insight and creative problem-solving skills.

The topics covered in the RMM are broadly within the scope of the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) syllabus, which includes:

* **Algebra:** This includes polynomials, equations, inequalities, sequences and series, functions, and algebraic manipulations. The problems can be quite advanced, often involving clever manipulations and non-standard techniques.
* **Number Theory:** Topics include divisibility, prime numbers, modular arithmetic, Diophantine equations, and properties of integers. RMM problems in number theory can be particularly intricate and may require a strong understanding of fundamental concepts.
* **Geometry:** This area covers plane geometry, solid geometry, coordinate geometry, and sometimes trigonometry within geometric contexts. Expect challenging problems involving properties of triangles, circles, quadrilaterals, and other geometric figures, often requiring elegant proofs and constructions.
* **Combinatorics:** This includes counting techniques, permutations, combinations, probability, graph theory (basics), and combinatorial arguments. RMM combinatorics problems often demand careful reasoning and the application of advanced counting principles.

**Key Characteristics of RMM Problems:**

* **Difficulty:** The problems are generally considered to be at a very high difficulty level, often exceeding that of typical national olympiads and being comparable to or even harder than IMO problems.
* **Creativity:** Solutions often require innovative ideas and non-standard approaches. Familiar techniques might need to be applied in unexpected ways.
* **Depth of Understanding:** A superficial understanding of mathematical concepts is usually insufficient. A deep and thorough grasp of the underlying principles is necessary to tackle these problems.
* **Proof-Based:** The RMM, like most mathematics olympiads, requires complete and rigorous proofs for the solutions. Just arriving at the correct answer is not enough.

**Is there an official syllabus?**

Based on the search results, it appears the RMM does not have a specific, official syllabus in the way some other exams might. Instead, it draws upon the general areas of pre-college mathematics that are also relevant to the IMO. The difficulty and style of the problems are what set the RMM apart.

To get a better sense of the topics and the level of difficulty, looking at past RMM problems is highly recommended. These are readily available online.

In summary, the RMM mathematics exam contains topics from algebra, number theory, geometry, and combinatorics, presented in a highly challenging and creative manner, requiring deep understanding and strong problem-solving abilities.
