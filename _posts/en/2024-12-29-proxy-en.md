* The best way is to get a China Macao SIM card to use cellular data directly when needed. Visit [https://www.1888.com.mo](https://www.1888.com.mo). It costs around 80 CNY for 10 GB of cellular data, offering a fast and painless experience. 

* China Telecom Macao SIM cards are available in two types: red and blue. Red cards offer daily plans, typically costing 2, 3, or 5 Macao dollars per day. Blue cards provide data plans, such as 10GB for 98 Macao dollars or 20GB for 198 Macao dollars, without monthly charges.

* If you need more network data or use a laptop frequently, consider using [zhs.cloud](https://zhs.cloud). It provides access to approximately 15 global proxy servers for just 30 CNY per month.  

* On iOS, use Shadowrocket with Shadowsocks rules: [https://github.com/Johnshall/Shadowrocket-ADBlock-Rules-Forever](https://github.com/Johnshall/Shadowrocket-ADBlock-Rules-Forever). Configure global routing to separate China traffic from overseas traffic.  

* On Android, use V2Ray. On Fire TV, use the V2Ray app. On Apple TV, use the Shadowrocket app. On Mac, use the ShadowsocksX-NG app.  

* It is not recommended to set up a proxy server by yourself. Protocols like Shadowsocks, VMess, or Trojan are easily banned, regardless of the server used.  

* To switch the App Store to the USA region, turn on a global proxy (USA), and it will show the payment option of "None," allowing you to switch openly.  

* Use a Visa card to buy gift cards from Amazon or use the Apple gift card portal to charge your App Store account.
