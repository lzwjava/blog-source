Angst is a noun referring to a feeling of deep anxiety, dread, or unease, often about something existential, uncertain, or inevitable—like the fear of death, failure, or the meaninglessness of life. It's commonly associated with psychological or emotional turmoil.

### Etymology
- Borrowed from German *Angst* (meaning "fear" or "anxiety"), which traces back to Old High German *angust*, related to the Proto-Germanic *angustiz* ("narrowness" or "tightness," evoking a sense of constriction).

### Examples in Use
- "She felt a wave of angst about her upcoming job interview."
- In literature/philosophy: Often linked to existentialism (e.g., Kierkegaard's "angst" as the dizziness of freedom) or teen emotions in pop culture.
