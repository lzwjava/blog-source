Following the essay by Yin Wang, [Yin Wang: The Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything](https://lzwjava.github.io/answers-en) and his previous statements, it seems there have been many conspiracists before.

Not to mention Miles Mathis. You may check here, [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Miles_Mathis](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Miles_Mathis).

He even thought that pi equals 4. I was shocked too. But I thought he must know more about pi than I do. I know pi is approximately 3.14159265359. I just wrote it down, but I wasn't actually sure whether the last digits were correct. Now, I have confirmed it with Google.

One way to determine pi is to draw a circle and measure its circumference. I have never done this. When I first learned about pi in school, I probably just remembered its value. When I had the boldness to challenge it, I didn't work on this knowledge, and this piece of why pi is approximately 3.14159265359 doesn't matter to me personally. I am a full stack engineer now and don't need to use much math. Even though I learned a bit about machine learning and deep learning, the math involved in it is mainly calculus and linear algebra.

Miles Mathis' conspiracy theories that I am interested in include:

* Unsurprisingly, he's also a birther and 9/11 truther.
* All major internet sites, NASA, all universities, mainstream physics, and basically everything else (like bookstores) are infiltrated by the CIA.
* John Lennon faked his death and is currently living in Canada.
* The Trump assassination was staged.

I don't know the truth and have not yet studied them carefully. I have respect for him and he has the courage to say and speak his mind. He used time and effort to research these topics.

The good thing about conspiracy theories is that there is so much to learn within them. How they present, investigate, and analyze is interesting.

What I am interested in is the truth. Human beings are easily deceived, especially those in power and in politics.

Since there is so much knowledge to learn, why don't I focus on the truth in fields like math, physics, and computer science?

If I learn the truth first, I won't need to correct it later. As truths are reproducible and repeatable, they will help my life a lot.

To benefit humanity, you just need to invent or enhance knowledge that will help people. That's why I am particularly interested in reversing myopia, which I learned from Yin Wang and Todd Becker, and conducted through 3 years of personal experimentation.

I will start with my own interests, learn the truth to benefit me the most as a priority. Sometimes, I will learn about conspiracy theories to understand their thinking and research techniques.
