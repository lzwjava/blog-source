## Conspiracy

*2025.01.04*

Following the essay by Yin Wang, [Yin Wang: The Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything](https://lzwjava.github.io/answers-en) and his previous statements, it seems there have been many conspiracists before.

Not to mention Miles Mathis. You may check here, [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Miles_Mathis](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Miles_Mathis).

He even thought that pi equals 4. I was shocked too. But I thought he must know more about pi than I do. I know pi is approximately 3.14159265359. I just wrote it down, but I wasn't actually sure whether the last digits were correct. Now, I have confirmed it with Google.

One way to determine pi is to draw a circle and measure its circumference. I have never done this. When I first learned about pi in school, I probably just remembered its value. When I had the boldness to challenge it, I didn't work on this knowledge, and this piece of why pi is approximately 3.14159265359 doesn't matter to me personally. I am a full stack engineer now and don't need to use much math. Even though I learned a bit about machine learning and deep learning, the math involved in it is mainly calculus and linear algebra.

Miles Mathis' conspiracy theories that I am interested in include:

* Unsurprisingly, he's also a birther and 9/11 truther.
* All major internet sites, NASA, all universities, mainstream physics, and basically everything else (like bookstores) are infiltrated by the CIA.
* John Lennon faked his death and is currently living in Canada.
* The Trump assassination was staged.

I don't know the truth and have not yet studied them carefully. I have respect for him and he has the courage to say and speak his mind. He used time and effort to research these topics.

The good thing about conspiracy theories is that there is so much to learn within them. How they present, investigate, and analyze is interesting.

What I am interested in is the truth. Human beings are easily deceived, especially those in power and in politics.

Since there is so much knowledge to learn, why don't I focus on the truth in fields like math, physics, and computer science?

If I learn the truth first, I won't need to correct it later. As truths are reproducible and repeatable, they will help my life a lot.

To benefit humanity, you just need to invent or enhance knowledge that will help people. That's why I am particularly interested in reversing myopia, which I learned from Yin Wang and Todd Becker, and conducted through 3 years of personal experimentation.

I will start with my own interests, learn the truth to benefit me the most as a priority. Sometimes, I will learn about conspiracy theories to understand their thinking and research techniques.

## Sea is Better Than Space

*2025.07.27*

Sea is better than space. Elon Musk's SpaceX has never truly left Earth to enter space. Space photos often lack visible stars.

From this perspective, humans should focus on developing the sea rather than space. I recently swam several times in the summer of 2025.

Some Americans claim that astronauts went to the moon in 1969. I believe that's fake. I discussed this with some friends, and half of them agree it's not true.

One major concern is that if humans were so advanced in 1969 to go to the moon, why haven't they returned in over 50 years?

I was born in 1995. I remember at the end of the 1990s, in my hometown, a village in China, electricity was scarce for a few years. We had black-and-white TVs and Xiaobawang learning machines.

I believed they represented cutting-edge technology at the time. The first version of the iPod was released in November 2001, and the initial release of Linux came out in September 1991.

Technology companies and startups that provide products to the majority often showcase the most advanced technology. If new technology exists, why isn't it used to make money and profit? Eventually, some people or countries will commercialize it, so why don't the original inventors or discoverers bring it to the business world for the masses?

Does NASA or the American military possess powerful technology that hasn't been applied to consumer products? I suspect it's very difficult to do so.

I don't believe in things I haven't seen with my own eyes. I need to witness them personally. I only trust things that can be repeated consistently. With so many things to do and learn in this world, why focus on things we can't even touch?

Humans have never truly gone to space. Starting from this point, we should develop the sea instead. I spoke with a security guard at a swimming pool.

I suggested that one day, we could read or use mobile phones or computers underwater. He said that seems far-fetched. I disagreed.

People should develop the oceans; there are so many opportunities. It might be challenging to make mobile phones function underwater, but it's not impossible.

Water causes refraction, making it hard to see clearly, but that doesn't mean we can't use water wisely. We could create a "coffee pool," where people can drink coffee and use their phones in a pool. Of course, people can also swim for a while. There could be a place where merchants sell covers for devices, and users can pick them up. Many digital devices could be hung there for people to read or watch content.

These digital devices could be held in transparent, waterproof boxes, so they aren't easily damaged if water splashes on them. There could also be areas where people can use laptops.

Why would people like this? I think humans generally enjoy water and like staying in it. Humans can stay in water for 6 hours without issues, just like professional swimmers.

By doing so, people can spend more time with nature. Rivers, pools, and oceans are part of nature. We might need to use steel platforms on top of water to hold digital devices, allowing people to spend significant time in natural settings.

AI can handle a large part of work now. Perhaps people need to return to nature. Sea is better than space.
