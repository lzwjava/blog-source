- I lived 2km from Jinfeng subway station. My office was in the Renfeng building in Tianhe district.

- From home, I would go to Jinfeng terminal, take Line 6 to Tianhe Coach terminal, and then walk 500m to the office.

- A Didi car cost around 60 CNY per trip. A Gaode car cost around 40 CNY per trip.
