title: Resolving Hugging Face Dependency Conflict
translated: false
type: note
---

It looks like you're encountering a dependency conflict during a pip upgrade/install for Hugging Face-related packages (hf-xet and huggingface-hub). I'll break this down and provide steps to resolve it while honoring your preference to stick with `huggingface-hub==1.1.4`.

### Understanding the Issue
- **The Conflict**: Your installed `transformers==4.57.0` pins `huggingface-hub` to `<1.0` (specifically `>=0.34.0, <1.0`). The new `huggingface-hub==1.1.4` violates this because it's a major version bump (1.x series), which may introduce breaking changes.
- **The Warning**: Pip's resolver detected this but proceeded anyway (hence "Successfully installed"). However, this could lead to runtime errors in `transformers` (e.g., API incompatibilities when loading models or tokenizers).
- **Other Notes**: The `send2trash` parsing error is unrelated (likely a metadata issue in that package) and can be ignored unless you're using it. The upgrades to `hf-xet` and `typer-slim` completed fine.

In short: The install "worked," but your environment is now inconsistent. Running code with `transformers` might fail until resolved.

### Recommended Resolution: Update Transformers for Compatibility
Since you want to keep `huggingface-hub==1.1.4`, the cleanest fix is to upgrade `transformers` to a version that supports it. Hugging Face has released updates aligning with the 1.x hub.

1. **Check Latest Compatible Versions**:
   - Run this to see what's available:
     ```
     pip index versions transformers huggingface-hub
     ```
   - As of now, `transformers>=4.46.0` (ideally the latest, like 4.46.3 or higher) supports `huggingface-hub>=1.0`. The 4.57.0 you're on is older and pinned to <1.0.

2. **Upgrade Transformers**:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade transformers
   ```
   - This should pull a version compatible with `huggingface-hub==1.1.4` (e.g., 4.46.x or later). If it doesn't auto-resolve, specify:
     ```
     pip install transformers>=4.46.0
     ```
   - After upgrading, verify with:
     ```
     pip check  # Should report no conflicts
     pip list | grep -E "(transformers|huggingface-hub)"
     ```

3. **If You Need to Pin Versions Exactly** (for reproducibility):
   ```
   pip install transformers==4.46.3 huggingface-hub==1.1.4 --force-reinstall
   ```
   - Adjust the transformers version based on your needs (check Hugging Face docs for features).

### Alternative: Force Ignore the Conflict (Not Recommended)
If you must avoid updating `transformers` right now (e.g., for testing), you can suppress the warning and proceed at your own risk:
```
pip install huggingface-hub==1.1.4 --force-reinstall --no-deps
```
- `--no-deps` skips checking dependencies.
- **Warning**: This might break `transformers` functionality (e.g., `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained()` could fail). Test your code immediately after.

### Best Practices Going Forward
- Use a virtual environment (e.g., via `venv` or `conda`) to isolate projects and avoid global conflicts.
- For Hugging Face stacks, consider `pip install -U transformers datasets tokenizers` to keep everything in sync.
- If you're using this in a script/notebook, import and test early:
  ```python
  import transformers
  from huggingface_hub import HfApi
  print(transformers.__version__)  # Should be compatible
  ```
- Monitor for issues: Hugging Face's changelog notes that 1.x hub changes affect repository handling and authentication—review if your code relies on those.

If this doesn't resolve it or you share more details (e.g., your full `requirements.txt` or error when running code), I can refine the advice!
