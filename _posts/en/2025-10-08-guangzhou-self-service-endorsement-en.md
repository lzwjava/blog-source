Yes, in big cities like Guangzhou, local police stations (派出所, or paichusuo) can handle applications for Hong Kong and Macau endorsements (港澳签注) through self-service machines (智能签注机). These are widely available across districts and operate 24 hours a day in many cases, making it convenient for eligible residents.

### Key Details:
- **Eligibility**: Primarily for Guangdong province residents or those with a valid Guangzhou residence permit. It's mainly for re-endorsements (e.g., tourism or business on an existing pass). For a first-time blank pass, you typically need to go to a district-level exit-entry office. Non-local residents should check with their home province's police.
- **Process**: Use the self-service machine to scan your ID, pay, and get the endorsement on the spot (often in 3-5 minutes). No appointment needed.
- **Locations**: There are over 100 machines in Guangzhou, with many right in local police stations. For example:
  - **Baiyun District**: Stone Gate Police Station (鸦岗中路66号石门派出所), Tongde Police Station (西槎路上步路23号同德派出所), and others.
  - **Haizhu District**: Xin'gang Police Station (新港西路142号大院5号楼新港派出所), Jianghai Police Station (敦和路223号江海派出所).
  - **Tianhe District**: Liede Police Station (海清路13号猎德派出所), Shipai Police Station (龙口中路152号石牌派出所).
  - Similar setups in Panyu, Huadu, Huangpu, Liwan, Yuexiu, and Conghua districts—most are in paichusuo.
