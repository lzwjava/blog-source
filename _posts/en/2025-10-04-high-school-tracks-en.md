I understand your point about this class structure in some Chinese high schools—it's a common setup tied to the gaokao preparation system, where students choose between science (理科, lǐkē) or liberal arts (文科, wēnkē) tracks around the end of junior high or early senior high. In mixed classes like the one you're describing (roughly half-and-half), everyone starts together for shared subjects like Chinese, math, English, and PE, but then splits off to "neighborhood" (or adjacent) classes for track-specific courses (e.g., physics/chemistry/biology for science students, or history/politics/geography for liberal arts). For the so-called "best class" in a grade, this can indeed feel inefficient. Let me break down my thoughts on it, pros and cons style, and why a fully homogeneous group of 35 all-science students might edge it out for focused learning.

### Why the Mixed Setup Might Not Be Ideal for a Top-Tier Class
- **Logistical Hassle and Disruption**: As you noted, students constantly shuffling between rooms for half their schedule fragments the class cohesion. It eats into transition time (5-10 minutes per switch?), disrupts momentum, and can lead to fatigue. In a high-pressure environment like Chinese high school, where every minute counts for gaokao prep, this isn't optimal. For the "best" students—who are often the most motivated and competitive—it's like herding cats when they could be laser-focused in one room.
  
- **Uneven Pacing and Motivation**: Teachers in mixed classes might water down content to accommodate both tracks, or the split creates uneven group dynamics. Science whizzes might feel held back if they're occasionally lumped with liberal arts peers for non-track subjects, and vice versa. Studies on educational psychology (e.g., from Vygotsky's zone of proximal development) show that homogeneous grouping can accelerate learning because peers are at similar levels, fostering deeper discussions and peer teaching without the need for constant adaptation.

- **Resource Strain**: Schools do this to balance teacher loads and facilities, especially in urban areas with limited space. But for elite classes, it dilutes the "premium" feel—why not dedicate resources to a pure science stream if that's where the top talent lies?

In short, for a group of 35 all-science students, as you suggest, they'd likely thrive more: same curriculum means streamlined teaching, stronger group study vibes, and less administrative BS. It's like training a marathon team—everyone runs the same route, so you build synergy without detours.

### But... Mixed Classes Aren't All Bad (The Counterarguments)
To be fair, this arrangement has some upsides, especially in a system like China's where tracks are rigid post-choice:
- **Diversity Benefits**: Mixing exposes students to different mindsets early on. Science kids might pick up better essay-writing skills from liberal arts peers (crucial for gaokao's comprehensive sections), and it builds social skills in a diverse group. Research from places like OECD's PISA studies shows diverse classrooms can boost creativity and empathy, which aren't just "nice-to-haves" in adulthood.
  
- **Practical for Schools**: Not every school can afford fully segregated top classes. Mixing the "best" ensures high-achievers across tracks get quality shared instruction (e.g., from star math teachers), and it prevents talent silos. In smaller cities or under-resourced schools, it's a compromise that maximizes access.

- **Real-World Prep**: Life (and college/work) isn't segregated by major, so practicing collaboration across disciplines could pay off long-term. But yeah, when gaokao is the immediate apocalypse, short-term efficiency trumps that.

### My Overall Take
You're spot on that for pure growth in a specialized track, homogeneous classes like your all-science example are superior—it's a strategy many top schools (e.g., in Beijing or Shanghai) use for their flagship streams to maximize scores and university placements. The mixed model works okay for average classes but feels like a mismatch for the grade's elite, where every edge matters. If this is based on your experience, I'd suggest chatting with school admins or counselors about track purity options; some places allow top students to petition for streams. Education systems evolve, and China's is tweaking gaokao for more flexibility—maybe we'll see less mixing in the future.

What do you think—have you seen this play out in your school, and how does it affect morale?
