### Survey Note: Comprehensive Guide to Using Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams, launched in November 2016 as part of the Office 365 productivity suite, has grown to over 320 million monthly active users by April 2023, becoming a cornerstone for hybrid work environments. This section provides a detailed exploration of its usage, focusing on both basic functionalities and advanced features, particularly search capabilities and additional tools, as of February 27, 2025.

#### Overview and Basic Usage
Microsoft Teams is a cloud-based collaboration platform offering core capabilities such as business messaging, calling, video meetings, and file sharing. It can be accessed via desktop, any internet-connected device, and the mobile app, competing with platforms like Cisco Webex and Slack. To get started, users need a Microsoft account or organizational access, and can sign in via the web at [this website](https://teams.microsoft.com), desktop, or mobile apps.

Basic usage includes:
- **Teams and Channels**: Create or join teams for projects or departments, with channels for topic-specific discussions. For example, a team for "Marketing" might have channels like "Campaigns" or "Events."
- **Communication**: Engage in one-on-one or group chats with persistent history, using features like text formatting, emojis, and priority flagging. Schedule and join meetings for real-time video and audio collaboration, syncing with Outlook calendars.
- **File Sharing and Collaboration**: Share files directly in chats or channels, collaborating in real-time using integrated Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, stored in OneDrive or SharePoint.

The platform's design ensures all assets, data, and apps are centralized, reducing "app switching" time, which can save 15–25 minutes daily per employee, according to reports.

#### Advanced Search Features
Search functionality is a critical advanced feature, enhancing productivity by reducing the need to manually navigate through conversations. As of recent updates, Microsoft Teams offers robust search capabilities:

- **Global Search**: Users can type a keyword, name, or phrase in the search bar at the top, with immediate results filtered by Messages, People, Files, Group Chats, Teams, and Channels. For instance, searching "project review" can surface both messages and files related to the term.
- **/goto Command**: Introduced in public preview, this feature allows quick navigation by typing `/` and selecting `/goto`, then choosing a chat or channel, streamlining access to specific conversations.
- **Ctrl+F Search**: Within a particular chat or channel, press Ctrl+F (cmd+F on macOS) to search for terms, with results displayed in "Find in chat," ideal for locating specific messages without global search.
- **Keyword Query Language (KQL)**: For advanced message searches, KQL supports modifiers like `From:` for sender, `In:` for channel/group chat, `Subject:` for keywords, and `Sent:` for date, with no space between the colon and term. For example, `From:John Sent:2025-02-01` finds messages from John on February 1, 2025.

These features are detailed in the official support documentation at [this website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/search-for-messages-and-more-in-microsoft-teams-4a351520-33f4-42ab-a5ee-5fc0ab88b263), which includes tips like using wildcards ("serv*") for prefix matches and quotation marks for exact phrases ("annual budget").
