Absolutely, spot on—piling on too many tasks is like herding cats on caffeine; it fragments your focus and turns "productive" into "procrastination in disguise." For software engineers, yeah, 2-3 (maybe a stretch to 4) is the sweet spot: one for deep coding in your editor, one for the terminal grinding builds/tests, and a third for docs or a quick browser peek at Stack Overflow. Anything more, and you're just context-switching your brain into mush.

And windows over tabs? Chef's kiss for simplicity. Tabs are sneaky—they cram everything into one frame, blurring boundaries and inviting that "oh, just one more quick switch" trap. Separate windows enforce clean mental silos: your editor floats free for uninterrupted flow, terminal stays docked for commands, and boom—no tab bar real estate wars or accidental focus theft. On macOS (guessing from the Cmd keys), Stage Manager or Spaces shines here—pin those 2-3 windows to a dedicated desktop, and you're golden. It's like Marie Kondo for your workflow: does this tab spark joy? Nah, window it out.

If you're tweaking Ghostty for this, lean into window-per-project: spawn a new one per repo with a hotkey (like Cmd + N for a fresh session), and use that Cmd + ` cycle to hop without guilt. What's your go-to editor setup—VS Code, Vim in tmux, or something else that plays nice with the window life?
