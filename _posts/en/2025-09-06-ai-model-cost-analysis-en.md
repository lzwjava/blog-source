## Executive Summary

This report presents a detailed, structured comparison of three leading AI models—DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct—to determine the most cost-effective yet powerful option tailored to a use case prioritizing low cost per token and high performance across reasoning, coding, and multilingual tasks. The analysis integrates official pricing, benchmark data from MMLU, HumanEval, MBPP, and community insights, alongside provider-specific constraints like rate limits and latency.

The top three models balancing cost and power are:

1. **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B**: Best for budget-conscious users needing strong reasoning and math capabilities at the lowest token cost, albeit with weaker coding performance and potential latency trade-offs.
2. **Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct**: Ideal for multimodal and high-performance applications requiring image and text integration, with moderate token costs and strong benchmark scores.
3. **Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct**: Optimal for coding-centric tasks, offering state-of-the-art open-source code generation and reasoning at very low token costs, with a large context window and broad programming language support.

Budget estimates for 10M input + 5M output tokens per month range from $0.60 (Qwen2.5-Coder) to $5 (DeepSeek-R1) to $160 (Llama-3.2), reflecting the trade-offs between cost, performance, and specialized use cases.

## Top 3 Recommendations

### 1. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B

**Rationale**: This model offers the lowest cost per token at $0.05 per 1 million tokens total, making it highly attractive for budget-sensitive applications. It delivers strong performance on reasoning benchmarks such as MMLU and excels in mathematical and factual inference tasks. However, its coding performance is weaker compared to Qwen-based models, and it may exhibit slower response times due to its distilled architecture. The model is available via OpenRouter and can be deployed on AWS and IBM’s watsonx.ai, providing flexibility but with some gating and rate limits.

**Best for**: Users prioritizing cost savings and requiring strong reasoning capabilities without heavy coding demands.

### 2. Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct

**Rationale**: Priced at $5e-06 per input token and $1.6e-05 per output token, this model balances cost and high performance with multimodal capabilities (text and image input). It is optimized for edge devices and supported by a broad ecosystem including Qualcomm and MediaTek hardware. The model excels in image understanding, visual reasoning, and general AI tasks, with high throughput and low latency. It is available on Vertex AI’s fully managed serverless platform, reducing infrastructure overhead.

**Best for**: Applications requiring multimodal AI, high performance, and scalability, especially in image and visual reasoning domains.

### 3. Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct

**Rationale**: With an extremely low cost of $6e-08 per input token and $2e-07 per output token, this model is the most cost-effective for coding tasks. It is the current state-of-the-art open-source code LLM, supporting over 40 programming languages and a 128K context window. The model excels in code generation, debugging, and reasoning benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP), with performance competitive to GPT-4o. It is open-sourced and deployable via BentoML and vLLM, offering flexibility but requiring GPU resources for optimal performance.

**Best for**: Developers and enterprises focused on coding, debugging, and multilingual programming tasks requiring a large context window.
