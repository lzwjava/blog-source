### Black Myth: Wukong on Your PC Setup

Your PC build is an absolute beast—i9-13900KF, RTX 4070, 64GB DDR5 RAM, and fast NVMe storage mean you'll crush this game at 4K ultra settings with ray tracing enabled, easily hitting 60+ FPS. No bottlenecks here; it's way above the recommended specs (which call for an RTX 2060 and i7-9700). The total build cost (~14,000 CNY) is solid value for a high-end rig like this.

Black Myth: Wukong is a single-player action RPG inspired by *Journey to the West*, where you play as the Destined One (a monkey warrior) fighting mythical bosses in ancient China. It's souls-like in combat (dodge, parry, stamina management) but more accessible, with fluid combos, transformations, and spell upgrades. Expect 30-40 hours for the main story, plus exploration and NG+.

#### Do You Need Windows? (Short Answer: No)
- **Steam on Ubuntu 22.04**: Steam runs natively on Linux. If you haven't installed it yet:
  1. Open a terminal and run: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install steam`.
  2. Launch Steam, log in, and let it download updates.
- **Game Compatibility**: Black Myth: Wukong has no native Linux version (it's Windows-only), but it runs *flawlessly* on Linux via Proton (Valve's compatibility layer built into Steam). It's rated **Platinum** on ProtonDB, meaning "perfect" out-of-the-box performance—no major tweaks needed. Users report better frame rates and stability on Linux than Windows in some cases, thanks to optimized Proton versions.
- **Potential Hiccups**: 
  - It uses Denuvo DRM, which might flag Proton version switches as "new installs" (limiting activations). Stick to one Proton version to avoid this.
  - Rare crashes on launch? Force Proton Experimental in Steam (right-click game > Properties > Compatibility > check "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool" > select Proton Experimental).
- **Benchmark Test**: Before buying, download the free Black Myth: Wukong Benchmark Tool from Steam—it runs great on Proton and lets you stress-test your setup.
- Bottom line: Stay on Ubuntu. Dual-booting Windows is overkill unless you play other anti-cheat-heavy multiplayer games (this one's single-player, so no issues).

If you *really* want Windows for peak optimization (e.g., 5-10% better perf in edge cases), it's easy to dual-boot, but it's unnecessary here.

#### How to Get and Play It
1. **Buy & Install**:
   - Search "Black Myth: Wukong" in Steam (App ID: 2358720). It's ~$60 USD / ~430 CNY, often on sale.
   - Install size: ~130GB, so your 1TB SSD is plenty (HDD for overflow if needed).
   - In Steam: Right-click the game > Properties > Compatibility > Enable Steam Play for all titles > Select Proton Experimental.

2. **Controls (Keyboard/Mouse Default)**:
   - Use your existing mouse/keyboard—it's responsive, but a controller (Xbox/PS) feels more natural for combos.
   - **Movement**: WASD to move, Space to dodge/jump, Shift to sprint.
   - **Combat**: Left-click (light attack), Right-click (heavy attack), R (parry—timing is key!), Q/E (spells), F (immobilize enemies for finishers).
   - **Stamina**: Attacks/dodges drain a blue bar—manage it like Dark Souls.
   - **Upgrades**: Collect Will (souls equivalent) to level skills at shrines. Focus on staffs, transformations (e.g., become a bird for aerial attacks), and relics.
   - Remap keys in Settings > Controls if needed.

3. **Quick Tips to Start Strong**:
   - **Early Game**: Prioritize dodging over blocking—parrying comes later. Explore for hidden pots (they drop loot).
   - **Bosses**: Learn patterns; use pillars for cover. Sparks (upgrades) are hidden—search high/low ground.
   - **Performance**: In-game, set to Very High preset, DLSS Quality (your 4070 shines here), and cap FPS at 60 for smoothness.
   - **Audio/Subs**: English VO is solid, but Chinese with subs captures the myth vibe better.
   - Save often at Keeper's Shrines (checkpoints).

If you hit snags (e.g., controller setup), Lutris or Heroic Launcher are alternatives, but Steam Proton is simplest. Enjoy the epic fights—it's one of 2024's best!
