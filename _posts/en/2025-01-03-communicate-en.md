* Don't argue with family, friends, or others who have different opinions. It is pointless to argue and can sometimes be hurtful.

* It is hard to make someone listen to you, even if you are right. There is no need to prove yourself. The truth sometimes takes a lot of time to prevail.

* Pursue similarity while respecting differences.

* Talk with people about topics they like.

* Value differences. My mind changes every few years. Everyone has a different background and way of thinking. No two people have exactly the same thoughts or opinions about everything.

* Be more tolerant and control yourself. Stay calm first.

* Try to observe what constitutes good communication and what is useless communication.

* Try to seek less recognition from others.

* Engage in less wishful thinking. Give people what they want. If you can't, just stand aside and focus on your life.

* The method and frequency of communication are important. Try to adapt to others. One can use digital means or face-to-face communication. One can communicate with the public, a group, or one-on-one.

* For digital communication, one can use text, images, or videos. One can use different software and languages to communicate.

* Regarding frequency, you can communicate with people once an hour, a day, a year, or every few years.

* For offline communication, adapt to others' needs. Even for your closest friends, the frequency, location, or form of communication can vary.

* Focus on your life and communicate with people who can lead you, inspire you, and teach you.

* Parents' or others' complaints are a form of emotional manipulation. Think objectively about whether you should listen to or follow what they say to stop their complaints. Find the root cause to see whether it is nonsensical or invasive.
