### Easy and Frequent Air Fryer or Electric Oven Recipes for Night Meals

Sweet potatoes with purple flesh (like Okinawan or purple yams) are a fantastic, nutritious choice for air frying or oven-roasting—they cook up crispy on the outside and creamy inside in about 20-30 minutes at 400°F (200°C). For variety in your evening meals, here are some other simple, healthy options that work well in both appliances. These are quick to prep (under 15 minutes), versatile for meal prep, and great for regular rotation. I'll include basic cooking tips for each.

#### 1. **Roasted Vegetables (e.g., Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, or Zucchini)**
   - **Why it's great for nights**: High in fiber and vitamins, low-carb, and pairs with proteins for a balanced meal. Cook often as a side or main with a dip.
   - **Air Fryer**: Toss 2-3 cups chopped veggies in olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Air fry at 380°F (190°C) for 10-15 minutes, shaking halfway.
   - **Electric Oven**: Same prep; bake on a sheet pan at 425°F (220°C) for 15-20 minutes, flipping once.
   - **Meal idea**: Serve with grilled chicken or quinoa for a light dinner. Prep tip: Batch-cook for the week.

#### 2. **Baked Chicken Breasts or Thighs**
   - **Why it's great for nights**: Lean protein that's filling without being heavy. Season simply for everyday meals.
   - **Air Fryer**: Rub 4-6 oz portions with oil, herbs, and spices (e.g., paprika, rosemary). Air fry at 360°F (180°C) for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway, until internal temp reaches 165°F (75°C).
   - **Electric Oven**: Same prep; bake on a wire rack at 375°F (190°C) for 20-25 minutes.
   - **Meal idea**: Slice over a salad or with roasted veggies. It's forgiving for beginners and reheats well.

#### 3. **Crispy Salmon or Fish Fillets**
   - **Why it's great for nights**: Omega-3s for heart health, cooks in under 15 minutes, and feels like a treat without much effort.
   - **Air Fryer**: Brush 4-6 oz fillets with oil, lemon, and dill. Air fry at 400°F (200°C) for 8-12 minutes (skin-side down if applicable).
   - **Electric Oven**: Bake on foil-lined pan at 400°F (200°C) for 10-15 minutes.
   - **Meal idea**: Top with a yogurt sauce and steam some greens on the side. Sustainable and quick—perfect for 2-3 times a week.

#### 4. **Baked Sweet Corn or Other Root Veggies (e.g., Carrots, Beets)**
   - **Why it's great for nights**: Naturally sweet and comforting, similar to your purple sweet potatoes but with color variety.
   - **Air Fryer**: Cut into wedges, toss with oil and cumin. Air fry at 380°F (190°C) for 12-18 minutes.
   - **Electric Oven**: Roast at 425°F (220°C) for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
   - **Meal idea**: Mix with chickpeas for a veggie bowl or as a snack-turned-dinner.

#### General Tips for Frequent Cooking
- **Portion and Prep**: Aim for 1-2 lbs of ingredients to feed 2-4 people. Use parchment paper or foil for easy cleanup.
- **Seasoning Staples**: Keep olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic, and herbs (like thyme or Italian seasoning) on hand to keep things simple and flavorful.
- **Health Boost**: Add a sprinkle of parmesan or nutritional yeast for umami without extra calories.
- **Time-Savers**: Both appliances preheat fast (air fryer in 3-5 mins), so they're ideal for busy evenings. Experiment with frozen veggies or pre-chopped items to cut prep time.
- **Variations**: For plant-based nights, swap proteins for tofu or chickpeas—air fry them similarly for crunch.

These options are nutrient-dense and easy to incorporate 3-5 times a week without boredom. If you have dietary preferences (e.g., vegan or low-sodium), let me know for more tailored ideas!
