The Snapdragon 410 board typically refers to the DragonBoard 410c, a compact single-board computer (SBC) developed by Qualcomm as a reference platform for IoT, embedded systems, and prototyping. Released around 2015, it's part of the 96Boards ecosystem and measures about the size of a credit card. Key specs include:

- **Processor**: Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 (MSM8916/APQ8016), a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU clocked at up to 1.2 GHz.
- **GPU**: Adreno 306 at 450 MHz, supporting 1080p video playback and basic graphics.
- **Memory/Storage**: 1 GB LPDDR3 RAM and 8 GB eMMC storage (expandable via microSD).
- **Connectivity**: Dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, USB 2.0, HDMI, and GPIO pins for hardware tinkering.
- **OS Support**: Runs Linux (e.g., Ubuntu), Android, and Windows 10 IoT Core out of the box.

It's designed for developers building low-power devices like smart home gadgets or industrial sensors, with strong emphasis on wireless features and expandability.

### Performance
The Snapdragon 410 is an entry-level SoC from the mid-2010s, built on a 28nm process, making it power-efficient but dated by 2025 standards. It's adequate for basic tasks like web browsing, email, light media playback, and simple IoT apps, but it lags in multitasking, gaming, or demanding computations.

Key benchmark highlights (from devices using this chip):
- **Geekbench 6**: Single-core ~200–250, multi-core ~600–700 (comparable to very low-end modern chips).
- **3DMark Ice Storm**: Around 8,500–9,000 points (physics/graphics tests), suitable for 2D interfaces but struggles with 3D games.
- **AnTuTu v6**: Roughly 20,000–25,000 total score, emphasizing its budget positioning.

In real-world use on the DragonBoard, expect smooth operation for development scripting or sensor integration, but it may throttle under sustained loads due to thermal limits and limited RAM. It's outperformed by even mid-range 2020-era chips (e.g., 5–10x slower than a Snapdragon 888 in multi-core tasks), so it's best for hobbyist projects rather than production high-performance needs.
