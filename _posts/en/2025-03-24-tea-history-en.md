The history of tea dates back thousands of years, with its origins rooted in ancient China. Over time, it spread across continents, influencing cultures, economies, and traditions worldwide. Here’s a brief overview:

### **Origins in China (c. 2737 BCE)**
Legend attributes the discovery of tea to **Emperor Shen Nong**, a mythical Chinese ruler and herbalist. It is said that while boiling water under a tree, tea leaves accidentally fell into his pot, creating the first tea infusion. Early Chinese records mention tea as a medicinal drink.

By the **Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE)**, tea drinking had become widespread in China, leading to the development of tea culture. The famous **Tea Classic (Cha Jing)**, written by **Lu Yu**, detailed the art and preparation of tea.

### **Spread to Japan and Korea (8th–9th Century)**
Tea was introduced to Japan by Buddhist monks who studied in China. It became integral to **Zen Buddhism**, leading to the development of the **Japanese tea ceremony (chanoyu)**, a highly ritualistic way of preparing and drinking tea.

### **Introduction to the Middle East and Central Asia (9th–13th Century)**
Through the Silk Road, tea traveled westward. By the 9th century, it reached Persia (modern-day Iran) and became a popular beverage in Middle Eastern cultures.

### **Arrival in Europe (16th–17th Century)**
Portuguese and Dutch traders were among the first Europeans to encounter tea through trade with China. The **Dutch East India Company** began importing tea to Europe in the early 1600s. In 1662, **Catherine of Braganza**, a Portuguese princess who married King Charles II of England, popularized tea drinking in Britain.

### **Tea and the British Empire (18th–19th Century)**
Britain’s demand for tea grew so much that it led to significant historical events:
- **The Opium Wars (1839–1860):** Britain smuggled opium into China to balance its trade deficit caused by tea imports, leading to conflicts.
- **Tea Cultivation in India (1830s):** The British started large-scale tea plantations in India (Assam and Darjeeling) and later in Sri Lanka (Ceylon), breaking China’s monopoly.

### **Tea in the Modern World**
By the 20th century, tea had become a staple worldwide. Innovations like **tea bags (invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, a New York merchant)** and **iced tea (popularized at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair)** revolutionized how tea was consumed.

Today, tea remains one of the most popular beverages globally, with distinct traditions such as **British afternoon tea, Indian chai culture, Moroccan mint tea, and Chinese gongfu tea ceremonies**.
