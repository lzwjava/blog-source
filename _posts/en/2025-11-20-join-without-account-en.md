### Can you join a Microsoft Teams meeting without an account?
Yes, in most cases:

- If the meeting organizer allows it (default for many organizations), you can **join as a guest** without a Microsoft account.
- You'll usually click the meeting link → choose **“Join as a guest”** or **“Continue without signing in”** → type your name → join.
- Some organizations disable guest access for security reasons. In that case you’ll be forced to sign in with a Microsoft account (free personal account works too).

### How to share your screen in Microsoft Teams

#### During a meeting (desktop app or web):
1. Join the meeting.
2. At the top toolbar, click the **Share** button (it looks like an arrow pointing up from a box, or sometimes a screen icon).
3. Choose what you want to share:
   - **Entire screen** (Screen 1, Screen 2, etc.) – recommended if you have multiple monitors
   - **Window** – share only one specific app/window
   - **PowerPoint Live** – for presentations
   - **Whiteboard** – collaborative drawing
4. When you're done, click **Stop sharing** at the top red bar.

#### Mobile (iOS/Android):
1. Join the meeting.
2. Tap the **… (More actions)** button.
3. Tap **Share** → **Share screen**.
4. Confirm the broadcast/start recording prompt from your phone.
5. To stop: pull down the notification or return to Teams and tap **Stop sharing**.

#### Quick keyboard shortcuts (Windows/Mac desktop):
- Start sharing: **Ctrl + Shift + E** (Windows) or **⌘ + Shift + E** (Mac)
- Stop sharing: same shortcut again or click the red Stop button

That’s it! Most people can join without any account, and screen sharing works the same whether you're signed in or a guest.
