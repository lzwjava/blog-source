T.D. Lee and C.N. Yang shared the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics for their theoretical work proposing that parity (mirror symmetry) is not conserved in weak interactions, a discovery confirmed experimentally soon after. Their collaboration was intense and productive, but it later soured into a public feud over relative contributions, particularly after Yang's 1983 book *Selected Papers 1945–1980 with Commentary*, where he described the origins of the parity idea in a way that emphasized his own role as the primary driver, implying he did the "lion's share" of the intellectual heavy lifting.

Lee pushed back against this narrative in subsequent writings and talks, insisting the idea stemmed from his own earlier insights and that their work was a true partnership, though he positioned himself as the originator of the key question. In a 1984 CERN lecture titled "History of the Weak Interactions," Lee provided a detailed personal account of the discovery process:

> In the summer of 1955... I considered the idea that parity might not be conserved in these decays [of strange particles like the theta-tau puzzle]. I noted that strange particles are "by definition strange, so why should they respect parity?" I discussed this possibility with Yang, but we were not able to make any progress. So we instead wrote papers on parity doublets, which was another wrong try.

He continued, describing the 1956 breakthrough:

> While discussing decay angles in hyperon disintegrations with Jack Steinberger... I realized how non-conservation of parity might be revealed if data were analyzed correctly... About two weeks later, Yang joined me, leading to our key discovery: despite extensive use of parity in nuclear physics and beta decay, there was no evidence of parity conservation in any weak interaction.

Lee framed this as his initial "flicker" of the idea evolving through collaboration, crediting Steinberger's experimental data for sparking the generalization but not downplaying his own foundational questioning. He emphasized the rapid timeline—mere weeks from insight to paper submission—and the "fortunate circumstances" of Yang's involvement, without ceding primacy.

In his 2004 book *Response to the Dispute of Discovery of Parity Violation* (published in Chinese), Lee directly addressed Yang's claims, arguing that historical records, including notebooks and correspondence, showed the parity question originated with him during solitary work on the theta-tau puzzle in early 1956, before Yang's deeper input. English summaries describe Lee as asserting that Yang's version "distorted the facts" and overlooked Lee's independent preliminary calculations on hyperon decays, which predated their joint paper. Lee wrote that the dispute pained him but was necessary to correct the record for posterity, stating (in translated excerpts): "The truth of scientific discovery cannot be altered by personal narratives; it belongs to the evidence and the timeline."

The rift, triggered partly by a 1962 *New Yorker* profile that portrayed Lee as the lead thinker (upsetting Yang), never fully healed. Lee later reflected in a 1986 remembrance: "The delicate symmetry between Yang and myself was disturbed." Despite the bitterness, both maintained their stature, with Lee continuing to mentor Chinese physicists and Yang pursuing statistical mechanics. The Nobel committee's citation treated their work as indivisible, underscoring the joint nature even amid the discord.
