I'll search for information about how different AI models represent matrices and which format is considered cleaner or easier to read.Let me search for more specific information about readability and which format is considered easier to read.Based on my search results, the answer to your question is nuanced—it's really about context and preference rather than an objective "right" answer:

**On readability and cleanliness:**

Different bracket notations (parentheses vs. brackets) for matrices are interchangeable and largely a matter of notation comfort. The plain bracket/text notation you're referring to as Claude's approach has some practical advantages:

- **Simpler source code**: Plain text notation with brackets is more straightforward to write and doesn't require learning LaTeX syntax
- **Better for inline text**: For matrices that appear within text, smaller matrix representations are often preferred to avoid them looking too large

**On LaTeX's perspective:**

Square bracket notation is mostly used by engineers and physicists, while mathematicians tend to prefer parenthesis notation. However, LaTeX is considered the standard in scientific and academic publishing because it produces professional-quality typeset output with proper mathematical formatting.

**The real difference:**

The choice isn't really about "cleaner" in a universal sense. Rather:
- **Plain text/bracket notation** (what Claude uses): Easier to read directly in raw format, simpler to type, good for informal contexts
- **LaTeX**: Better for professional documents, renders beautifully in PDFs, more suitable for complex mathematical expressions

So your observation has merit—plain bracket notation *is* easier to read in plain text form. But LaTeX was designed to create publication-quality mathematics, which is a different goal. Neither is objectively "better"; they serve different purposes.
