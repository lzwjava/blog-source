# Features

1. Automatically close the oldest tabs when the number of tabs exceeds a set limit.
2. Customize the maximum number of tabs (x) according to your preference.
3. Lock specific URL patterns to ensure that tabs matching those patterns remain open, even when there are too many tabs open.

## Story

I usually open many tabs in Chrome. So I press Ctrl + W to close them a lot one time. Repeat and repeat. So I want to write an extension to solve my problem. Then I found “Tab Wrangler” extension which close tabs when x minutes not active. I learned from it. and make a extension to close the oldest tabs when more than x tabs. And lock some tabs whose url matches some pattern. It helps me a lot. I just do not need to take care of tabs any more. Tabs never become too many. It ease my life. Hope you like it so.
