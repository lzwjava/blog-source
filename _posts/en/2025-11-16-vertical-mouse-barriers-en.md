title: Vertical Mouse Adoption Barriers Explained
translated: false
type: note

Here are the main reasons why vertical mice are still a minority choice, even though they’re clearly better for wrist health for many people:

| Reason | Explanation | How big a barrier it really is |
|---------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Habit & muscle memory | Most people have used traditional mice for 20–30+ years. Switching feels extremely weird for the first 1–3 weeks (like writing with your non-dominant hand). | Biggest initial hurdle – many give up in the first few days |
| Looks “weird” / office stigma | A vertical mouse stands out on a desk. Some feel self-conscious or get teased (“what’s that spaceship on your desk?”). In very conservative offices in Asia this matters more. | Surprisingly large in Taiwan/Japan/Korea workplaces |
| Higher price | Good vertical mice (Logitech MX Vertical, Evoluent, Anker, etc.) usually cost 2–4× a normal office mouse. Cheap no-name ones are often terrible and give the whole category a bad name. | Real barrier for students and many office workers |
| Learning curve for precision tasks | Graphic designers, CAD users, gamers, and some programmers find the early loss of pixel-perfect control frustrating. Most regain accuracy after 2–4 weeks, but some never do. | Serious issue only for ~10–15% of users |
| Size & hand-fit issues | Many vertical mice are made for medium-to-large Western hands. Smaller hands (common in East Asia) or very large hands often can’t find a perfect fit. | Very common complaint in Taiwan forums (巴哈姆特, Mobile01) |
| Availability & marketing | You rarely see them in regular computer stores in Taiwan (unlike regular mice). Most people simply never try one. | Huge – lack of exposure = lack of adoption |
| Short trial periods | Shops and Amazon return windows (14–30 days) are often not enough for the brain/hand to fully adapt. | Many return them before the benefits kick in |

Result: Only about 5–10% of heavy computer users (8+ hours/day) end up switching long-term, mostly people who already have wrist pain or RSI/carpal tunnel issues. For everyone else, “it works fine” + low motivation to change wins.

In Taiwan specifically, the most common comments on PTT/Mobile01/Dcard are:
- “用習慣就好，但一開始超級怪”
- “老闆看到會覺得我在摸魚”
- “貴一倍，不確定值不值得”

So it’s not that vertical mice don’t work — it’s that the activation energy to switch is high, and most people never reach the point where the ergonomic benefit outweighs the initial awkwardness.
