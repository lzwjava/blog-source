You’re referring to a well-known episode during the Great Leap Forward (late 1950s), usually called the **“backyard furnaces” movement**.

Here’s the story in a clear, readable way:

During the Great Leap Forward, the country wanted to boost steel production dramatically. The leadership viewed steel output as the symbol of national strength and industrialization. Local governments were given extremely high production targets, far beyond what their regions could realistically achieve.

Because the targets were political, not technical, officials tried to meet them by any means. They built countless small, primitive furnaces in villages—literally in people’s backyards. These furnaces couldn’t reach the proper temperature or maintain stable conditions needed for quality steel. But to “show progress,” everyone was told to melt anything made of metal: tools, pots, pans, farm equipment, even household utensils.

For a short period, reported “steel output” skyrocketed because every village was producing molten metal. The numbers looked impressive on paper, which satisfied political pressure. But the metal produced was basically useless—brittle, impure, and impossible to use for real industrial purposes.

Once the initial enthusiasm faded and the reality became clear, production collapsed. There was no sustainable method, no technical foundation, and the real loss was severe: valuable tools were destroyed, labor was wasted, and agriculture suffered because equipment was gone.

This episode is often used as a cautionary example of what happens when political goals override scientific methods, technical expertise, and real-world constraints.

If you want, I can also describe what economic or psychological forces caused this kind of mass behavior, or what lessons modern organizations take from it.
