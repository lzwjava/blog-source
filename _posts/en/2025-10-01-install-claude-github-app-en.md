title: Install Claude GitHub App for Collaboration
translated: false
type: note
---

Installing the Claude GitHub App via the /install-github-app command in Claude Code (Anthropic's AI-powered coding tool) enables seamless integration with GitHub. This lets you mention @claude directly in comments on GitHub issues or pull requests (PRs), allowing Claude to assist as a "virtual teammate" by responding to feedback, fixing errors, or suggesting code changes right within the GitHub interface. The command guides you through setup, including logging in with a Claude Max subscription and selecting repositories. [1][2][3] It transforms Claude from a terminal tool into an active participant in your development workflow, ideal for collaborative coding and CI/CD pipelines. [3][4][5][6][7]
