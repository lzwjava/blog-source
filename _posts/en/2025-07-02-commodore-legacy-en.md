Commodore International was a pivotal player in the early personal computer industry, known for its innovative and affordable computing solutions that brought technology into homes and businesses worldwide. Founded in 1954 by Jack Tramiel, a Holocaust survivor and Polish immigrant, the company began as a typewriter repair business in the Bronx, New York, before evolving into a major electronics and computer manufacturer. Its journey from humble beginnings to a household name in computing reflects both entrepreneurial grit and technological foresight, though its later years were marked by challenges that led to its eventual decline.

### Early Years: From Typewriters to Calculators
Commodore started as the Commodore Portable Typewriter Company, repairing and selling typewriters. By the late 1950s, it expanded into manufacturing typewriters and moved into adding machines to compete with companies like Olivetti and Casio. In 1962, the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange as Commodore Business Machines, Inc., reflecting its shift toward broader office equipment.

In the mid-1960s, Commodore entered the calculator market, capitalizing on the growing demand for electronic calculators. By acquiring MOS Technology in 1976, a semiconductor company, Commodore gained access to chip design expertise, which would prove critical for its later ventures into computers. MOS Technology’s 6502 microprocessor became the backbone of many early personal computers, including Commodore’s own.

### Rise to Prominence: The Personal Computer Era
Commodore’s entry into the personal computer market began with the **Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor)** in 1977. Unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show, the PET was one of the first all-in-one personal computers, featuring a keyboard, monitor, and cassette drive. Priced at around $795, it competed directly with the Apple II and Tandy TRS-80, targeting both home users and educational institutions. The PET’s success in North America and Europe established Commodore as a serious contender in the burgeoning PC market.

In 1981, Commodore released the **VIC-20**, a low-cost computer aimed at the mass market. Priced at $299.95, it was the first computer to sell over a million units, largely due to its affordability and marketing as a family-friendly device for gaming and learning. The VIC-20’s success showcased Commodore’s ability to deliver accessible technology, leveraging its vertical integration with MOS Technology to keep costs low.

The company’s crowning achievement came in 1982 with the **Commodore 64 (C64)**, which became the best-selling personal computer of all time, with estimates of 12.5–17 million units sold. Priced at $595 at launch, the C64 offered advanced graphics and sound capabilities through its custom chips (the VIC-II for video and SID for audio), making it a favorite for gaming, programming, and home use. Its affordability, extensive software library, and robust hardware design cemented its legacy. The C64’s cultural impact endures, with active enthusiast communities still developing software and hardware for it today.

### Other Notable Products
- **Commodore 16 and Plus/4 (1984)**: Aimed at the low-end market, these models were less successful due to limited software compatibility and competition from the C64.
- **Amiga Series (1985–1990s)**: Acquired through Commodore’s purchase of Amiga Corporation in 1984, the Amiga line (starting with the Amiga 1000) was revolutionary for its advanced graphics, multitasking operating system, and multimedia capabilities. Popular in video production, gaming, and creative industries, the Amiga 500 (1987) became a commercial hit, especially in Europe. However, mismanagement and lack of marketing hindered its competition against PCs and Apple’s Macintosh.
- **Commodore 128 (1985)**: A more advanced successor to the C64, it offered backward compatibility and improved specifications but didn’t replicate the C64’s success.

### Business Strategy and Leadership
Jack Tramiel’s philosophy of “computers for the masses, not the classes” drove Commodore’s focus on affordability, often undercutting competitors’ prices. This approach, combined with vertical integration through MOS Technology, allowed Commodore to control production costs and innovate rapidly. However, Tramiel’s departure in 1984, following disagreements with chairman Irving Gould, marked a turning point. Tramiel went on to found Atari Corporation, and Commodore struggled under new leadership to maintain its competitive edge.

### Decline and Bankruptcy
By the late 1980s, Commodore faced increasing competition from IBM-compatible PCs and Apple’s Macintosh. The company’s failure to effectively market the Amiga, coupled with inconsistent product strategies and internal mismanagement, eroded its market share. The PC market’s shift toward standardized hardware and software (like MS-DOS and later Windows) left Commodore’s proprietary systems at a disadvantage. Financial difficulties mounted, and in 1994, Commodore filed for bankruptcy, ceasing operations. Its assets were sold off, with the Amiga brand changing hands multiple times and the Commodore name later used for unrelated products.

### Legacy
Commodore’s impact on the personal computer industry is undeniable. The C64 and Amiga introduced millions to computing, fostering a generation of programmers, gamers, and tech enthusiasts. Its emphasis on affordability democratized technology, paving the way for the modern PC era. Today, retro computing communities keep Commodore’s legacy alive through emulation, hardware restoration, and new software development.
