title: Deadlock in Spring Boot

Let’s dive into solving a deadlock issue in a Spring Boot project when multiple requests hit a bean’s method concurrently. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads block each other indefinitely, often due to competing for shared resources like database locks, synchronized blocks, or thread-safe data structures. Since you’ve mentioned a bean’s method handling many requests, I’ll assume this is a singleton-scoped bean (Spring’s default scope) and explore common causes and solutions.

First, let’s identify potential deadlock scenarios in this context:
1. **Database Locks**: If the bean’s method interacts with a database (e.g., via JPA/Hibernate), concurrent transactions might lock rows or tables in conflicting orders.
2. **Synchronized Blocks**: If the method uses `synchronized` keyword or locks (e.g., `ReentrantLock`), improper lock ordering could cause threads to wait on each other.
3. **Shared Resources**: If the bean modifies a shared in-memory resource (e.g., a static variable or collection), contention might lead to deadlocks.
4. **External Calls**: If the method calls external services or APIs, delays or blocking behavior could exacerbate concurrency issues.

Since you haven’t shared specific code, I’ll provide a general approach to diagnose and fix the issue, then offer a concrete example.

### Step 1: Diagnose the Deadlock
- **Enable Logging**: Add logging (e.g., SLF4J with Logback) to trace method entry, exit, and resource access. This helps identify where threads stall.
- **Thread Dump**: When the deadlock occurs, capture a thread dump (e.g., using `jstack` or VisualVM). Look for threads in `BLOCKED` or `WAITING` states and check their stack traces for lock contention.
- **Monitoring**: Use tools like Spring Actuator or a profiler (e.g., YourKit) to observe thread behavior under load.

### Step 2: Common Fixes
Here’s how to address the deadlock based on likely causes:

#### Case 1: Database-Related Deadlock
If the bean’s method performs database operations, deadlocks often arise from transaction conflicts.
- **Solution**: Optimize transaction boundaries and lock acquisition order.
  - Use `@Transactional` with a proper isolation level (e.g., `READ_COMMITTED` instead of `SERIALIZABLE` unless strictly needed).
  - Ensure consistent order of resource access (e.g., always update table A before table B).
  - Reduce transaction scope by moving non-transactional logic outside `@Transactional`.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Service
  public class MyService {
      @Autowired
      private MyRepository repo;

      @Transactional
      public void processRequest(Long id1, Long id2) {
          // Ensure consistent order to avoid deadlock
          if (id1 < id2) {
              repo.updateEntity(id1);
              repo.updateEntity(id2);
          } else {
              repo.updateEntity(id2);
              repo.updateEntity(id1);
          }
      }
  }
  ```
- **Bonus**: Set a transaction timeout (e.g., `@Transactional(timeout = 5)`) to abort long-running transactions and prevent indefinite waits.

#### Case 2: Synchronized Blocks or Locks
If the method uses explicit locking, deadlocks can occur if locks are acquired in different orders across threads.
- **Solution**: Use a single lock or enforce lock ordering.
  - Replace multiple `synchronized` blocks with a single coarse-grained lock if feasible.
  - Use `ReentrantLock` with a timeout to avoid indefinite blocking.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Service
  public class MyService {
      private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

      public void processRequest(String resourceA, String resourceB) {
          try {
              if (lock.tryLock(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                  // Critical section
                  System.out.println("Processing " + resourceA + " and " + resourceB);
              } else {
                  throw new RuntimeException("Could not acquire lock in time");
              }
          } catch (InterruptedException e) {
              Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
          } finally {
              if (lock.isHeldByCurrentThread()) {
                  lock.unlock();
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

#### Case 3: Shared In-Memory Resources
If the bean modifies a shared collection or variable, concurrent access might cause issues.
- **Solution**: Use thread-safe alternatives or avoid shared state.
  - Replace `ArrayList` with `CopyOnWriteArrayList` or `Collections.synchronizedList`.
  - Use `ConcurrentHashMap` for maps.
  - Better yet, make the bean stateless or use request-scoped beans (`@Scope("request")`).
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Service
  @Scope("prototype") // Avoid singleton if stateful
  public class MyService {
      private final ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

      public void processRequest(String key, int value) {
          cache.put(key, value); // Thread-safe
      }
  }
  ```

#### Case 4: High Concurrency Load
If the deadlock stems from overwhelming the bean with requests, thread contention might be the root cause.
- **Solution**: Introduce asynchronous processing or rate limiting.
  - Use `@Async` to offload work to a thread pool.
  - Configure a thread pool with `TaskExecutor` to manage concurrency.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Service
  public class MyService {
      @Async
      public CompletableFuture<String> processRequest(String input) {
          // Simulate work
          Thread.sleep(1000);
          return CompletableFuture.completedFuture("Done: " + input);
      }
  }

  @Configuration
  @EnableAsync
  public class AsyncConfig {
      @Bean
      public TaskExecutor taskExecutor() {
          ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
          executor.setCorePoolSize(10);
          executor.setMaxPoolSize(50);
          executor.setQueueCapacity(100);
          return executor;
      }
  }
  ```
- **Usage**: Call `processRequest` and handle the `CompletableFuture` in the controller.

### Step 3: Prevent Future Issues
- **Load Testing**: Simulate high concurrency with tools like JMeter or Gatling to catch deadlocks early.
- **Code Review**: Check for nested locks, long-running transactions, or shared mutable state.
- **Timeouts**: Always set timeouts for locks, transactions, or external calls.

### Final Thoughts
Without seeing your bean’s code, I’ve assumed a singleton bean under heavy load with potential database or lock contention. If you share more details (e.g., the method’s code, stack traces, or what resources it accesses), I can tailor the solution further. For now, start by diagnosing with a thread dump and apply the relevant fix—database optimization, lock management, or async processing. Let me know how it goes!
