Using lemons in an air fryer can add bright, zesty flavor to various dishes. The air fryer’s high heat can caramelize lemon slices or intensify their flavor when used as a marinade or garnish. Below are some practical ways to incorporate lemons into air fryer cooking, along with tips and recipes:

### General Tips for Using Lemon in an Air Fryer
- **Fresh Lemons**: Use fresh lemons for the best flavor. Meyer lemons are sweeter and less tart, while regular lemons are more acidic.
- **Preparation**: Wash lemons thoroughly. Slice thinly for roasting or grilling, or juice/zest for marinades and coatings.
- **Prevent Sticking**: Lightly coat the air fryer basket with cooking spray or use parchment paper to prevent lemon slices or sticky marinades from adhering.
- **Temperature Control**: Lemons cook quickly due to their high water content. Use moderate temperatures (350–400°F / 175–200°C) to avoid burning.
- **Pairing**: Lemon complements proteins like chicken, fish, or shrimp, and vegetables like asparagus, zucchini, or potatoes.

### Methods and Recipes
1. **Air-Fried Lemon Slices (Garnish or Snack)**
   - **Purpose**: Creates caramelized, slightly crispy lemon slices for garnishing proteins, salads, or cocktails, or as a tangy snack.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Slice a lemon into ⅛-inch thick rounds. Pat dry with a paper towel.
     2. Lightly brush slices with olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt or sugar (optional, for sweet or savory).
     3. Preheat air fryer to 350°F (175°C).
     4. Place slices in a single layer in the basket. Cook for 5–7 minutes, flipping halfway, until edges are golden and slightly crisp.
     5. Let cool; they’ll crisp up more as they sit.
   - **Use**: Garnish air-fried salmon, chicken, or veggies, or add to drinks for a smoky-citrus twist.

2. **Lemon-Marinated Proteins**
   - **Purpose**: Infuse meats or seafood with bright flavor before air frying.
   - **Steps**:
     1. **Marinade**: Mix ¼ cup lemon juice, 2 tbsp olive oil, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 tsp dried oregano, and salt/pepper.
     2. Marinate protein (e.g., chicken breasts, salmon fillets, or shrimp) for 20–30 minutes (avoid longer to prevent the acid from “cooking” the protein).
     3. Preheat air fryer to 380°F (190°C).
     4. Pat protein dry, place in the basket, and cook (e.g., chicken: 10–12 minutes, flipping halfway; salmon: 8–10 minutes; shrimp: 5–7 minutes).
     5. Optional: Add a lemon slice on top during the last 2 minutes of cooking for extra flavor.
   - **Example**: Lemon garlic chicken thighs—marinate, air fry at 380°F for 12–15 minutes until internal temp reaches 165°F.

3. **Lemon-Infused Vegetables**
   - **Purpose**: Add a zesty kick to air-fried veggies.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Toss vegetables (e.g., asparagus, zucchini, or potatoes) with 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp olive oil, zest of 1 lemon, salt, and pepper.
     2. Preheat air fryer to 400°F (200°C).
     3. Cook vegetables in a single layer (e.g., asparagus: 6–8 minutes; potato wedges: 15–20 minutes, shaking halfway).
     4. Optional: Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the veggies after cooking for extra brightness.
   - **Example**: Lemon-parmesan zucchini fries—toss zucchini sticks with lemon juice, olive oil, and parmesan, then air fry at 400°F for 8–10 minutes.

4. **Lemon-Herb Compound Butter for Finishing**
   - **Purpose**: Drizzle or brush over air-fried foods for a rich, citrusy finish.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Mix 4 tbsp softened butter with zest of 1 lemon, 1 tbsp lemon juice, and 1 tsp chopped fresh herbs (e.g., parsley or thyme).
     2. Air fry your protein or veggies as desired.
     3. Immediately after cooking, brush or dollop the lemon butter over the hot food to melt and infuse flavor.
   - **Example**: Air-fried cod with lemon-thyme butter—cook cod at 375°F for 8–10 minutes, then brush with lemon butter.

### Additional Tips
- **Avoid Overcrowding**: Ensure lemon slices or marinated foods aren’t stacked to promote even cooking and crispiness.
- **Cleaning**: Lemon juice can caramelize and stick to the basket. Clean the air fryer promptly to avoid residue buildup.
- **Flavor Boost**: Combine lemon with complementary flavors like garlic, rosemary, honey, or chili for variety.
- **Safety**: Use tongs to handle hot lemon slices or foods, as the air fryer basket gets very hot.
