title: Ansible and SaltStack Orchestration Tools

In the context of “orchestration (Ansible/Salt)”, **Salt** refers to **SaltStack** (commonly just called **Salt**) – a popular open-source configuration management and **orchestration** tool, very similar to Ansible.

So the phrase means:  
“We’re talking about orchestration tools, specifically Ansible or SaltStack.”

### Quick comparison to clarify what “Salt” is here:

| Feature                  | Ansible                              | Salt (SaltStack)                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Type                     | Configuration management + orchestration | Configuration management + orchestration |
| Architecture             | Agentless (uses SSH)                 | Agent-based (minions) + optional agentless mode |
| Communication            | Push model (Ansible pushes changes)  | Push + Pull model (very fast event bus)   |
| Written in               | Python                               | Python                                    |
| Configuration language   | YAML (playbooks)                     | YAML (SLS files), also supports Jinja)  |
| Speed                    | Good                                 | Extremely fast at scale (ZeroMQ bus)      |
| State management         | Yes                                  | Yes (very powerful “state” system)        |
| Orchestration            | Yes (playbooks)                      | Yes (Salt Orchestrate / Reactor)          |
| Learning curve           | Easier for beginners                 | Slightly steeper                          |
| Company behind it        | Red Hat                              | Originally SaltStack Inc., acquired by VMware, now part of Broadcom |

### Why people write “Ansible/Salt”
They are the two most popular Python-based, open-source tools that do both:
- Configuration management (applying desired state to servers)
- Orchestration (coordinating complex, multi-step, multi-server operations)

So when someone says “orchestration (Ansible/Salt)”, they mean “we use either Ansible or SaltStack for orchestration tasks”.

Short answer: **Salt = SaltStack**, the configuration management and orchestration platform (https://saltproject.io).
