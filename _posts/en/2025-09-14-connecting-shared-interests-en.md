It sounds like you had a great experience connecting with like-minded people by sharing Yin Wang’s blog in a WeChat engineering group! You’re absolutely right—joining communities (online or offline) where people share similar interests is one of the best ways to meet kindred spirits. Here’s why your approach works so well:

### **Why Sharing in Niche Groups Works**
1. **Targeted Audience**: In a specialized group (e.g., engineers, programmers, or PLT enthusiasts), people are more likely to appreciate or engage with content like Yin Wang’s work. Your friends/family might not share the same passion, but a focused group will.
2. **Serendipity**: You never know who might respond—a fellow admirer of Yin Wang, someone who’s worked with him, or even someone who can introduce you to deeper discussions (e.g., programming languages, formal methods, or his critiques of academia).
3. **Low-Pressure Networking**: Sharing something you love is a natural icebreaker. It’s not forced small talk; it’s a genuine exchange of ideas, which builds stronger connections.
4. **Avoiding "Social Friction"**: Close friends or partners might not "get" your niche interests, and that’s okay! Seeking out communities where your passions are celebrated saves everyone from awkward "Why do you care about this?" conversations.

### **How to Maximize This Strategy**
- **Join More Groups**: Look for Slack/Discord communities, subreddits (e.g., r/programminglanguages), or even local meetups (e.g., PLT or functional programming groups). Yin Wang’s work spans PLT, education, and even philosophy—there are groups for all of these!
- **Engage Deeper**: After sharing, ask open-ended questions like:
  *"What’s your take on Yin Wang’s critique of modern CS education?"*
  *"Has anyone here applied his ideas on parsing or incremental computation?"*
  This invites discussion beyond just "I know him too."
- **Create Content**: Write a short summary of why you admire Yin Wang’s work (e.g., his [blog on parsing](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2020/07/01/parsing) or [education](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2016/06/07/mit-cs)) and share it. This attracts people who resonate with your perspective.
- **Attend Events**: Yin Wang occasionally gives talks (e.g., at Strange Loop or PL conferences). If you can’t attend in person, watch recordings and discuss them in groups.

### **A Word of Caution**
- **Avoid Spamming**: Share thoughtfully—don’t post the same link in 10 groups at once. Add context (e.g., "I’ve been re-reading Yin Wang’s essays on CS education; his point about X changed how I think about Y").
- **Balance Online/Offline**: While online groups are great, try to meet people IRL too (e.g., hackathons, conferences). Some of the best connections happen over coffee after a talk.
- **Embrace Differences**: Even in niche groups, people will have varying opinions. That’s the fun part! Debating Yin Wang’s takes (e.g., his [controversial views on Haskell](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2018/04/18/haskell)) can lead to fascinating discussions.

### **Yin Wang’s Work as a Conversation Starter**
His blog covers diverse topics—here are some "shareable" angles depending on the group:
- **For Programmers**: His [series on parsing](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2020/07/01/parsing) or [incremental computation](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2012/08/02/incremental-computation).
- **For Educators**: His [critique of MIT’s CS curriculum](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2016/06/07/mit-cs).
- **For Philosophers**: His [essays on truth and communication](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2013/05/14/truth).
- **For Chinese Speakers**: His [bilingual posts](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/) (e.g., on [Chinese education](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2016/05/20/china-education)).

### **Final Thought**
You’ve discovered a powerful principle: **Shared curiosity is the best social glue**. The people who light up when you mention Yin Wang (or any obscure hero of yours) are your tribe. Keep seeking them out—whether in WeChat groups, obscure forums, or conference hallways. The internet makes it easier than ever to find your "intellectual soulmates."

And who knows? Maybe one day you’ll bump into Yin Wang himself in a group and get to tell him how his work inspired you. (He’s active on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/yinwang0) and sometimes engages with readers!)

Keep sharing what you love—it’s how the best connections begin.
