title: The Remaining Value of Google Search in My Life

I rely on real-time information, and I use Google to search for it.  

I use Google to find links. Sometimes I remember certain websites but forget their exact URLs, so I use Google to locate them.  

I still use Google Image Search. I prefer finding real images rather than AI-generated ones.  

I use the Google search bar for translations. Although I could use AI chatbots, Google is more straightforward for this purpose, and it also provides pronunciations.

For example, I might search for something like "Somebody IOI" because I remember there’s an IOI stats page.  

I also use Google to find Wikipedia pages.  

Google is essentially my navigation hub. I no longer need Stack Overflow or blogs to fix coding or technical issues.  

I use Google for the tasks that AI chatbots can't handle.
