### What is a Subnet Mask?

A **subnet mask** (or netmask) is a 32-bit number (written in dotted decimal notation, like 255.255.255.0) that divides an IPv4 address into two parts:
- **Network portion**: Identifies the overall network (or subnet) a device belongs to.
- **Host portion**: Identifies the specific device (host) within that network.

It works like a filter: When a device sends data, the subnet mask is applied (via a bitwise AND operation) to the IP address to figure out if the destination is on the *local subnet* (direct communication, no router needed) or on a *remote network* (data goes through the default gateway/router).

#### Breaking Down 255.255.255.0
Your explanation is **exactly right**—let's confirm and expand on it step by step.

1. **In Binary (The Real Magic Happens Here)**:
   - Each octet (e.g., 255) is 8 bits, so the full mask is 32 bits.
   - 255 = `11111111` (all bits "on").
   - 0 = `00000000` (all bits "off").
   - So, 255.255.255.0 in binary is:  
     `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`
   - This means:
     - **First 24 bits (three 255s)**: Fixed as the **network prefix**. These can't change for devices in the same subnet—they define *which subnet* you're on.
     - **Last 8 bits (the 0)**: Variable as the **host portion**. These *can* change to identify individual devices.

2. **How Many Addresses in This Subnet?**
   - The host portion has 8 bits, so there are \\(2^8 = 256\\) possible combinations (from `00000000` to `11111111`, or 0 to 255 in decimal).
   - Example with a base IP like 192.168.1.0:
     - Network address: 192.168.1.0 (all host bits = 0; this is the subnet ID itself).
     - Usable hosts: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 (254 addresses, since .0 is reserved for the network and .255 for broadcast).
     - Broadcast: 192.168.1.255 (sends to everyone in the subnet).
   - Your router (e.g., at 192.168.1.1) assigns IPs from this pool via DHCP, like the 192.168.1.100 you mentioned.

3. **Communication Within the Subnet**:
   - Yes! Devices with IPs in the same subnet (e.g., your laptop at 192.168.1.100 and a phone at 192.168.1.50) can talk *directly* via Ethernet/Wi-Fi—no router hops needed. The subnet mask tells them: "Hey, we're neighbors—send packets straight to the MAC address."
   - If the destination is outside (e.g., 192.168.2.50), it goes to the default gateway (your router at 192.168.1.1) to route elsewhere.

#### Quick Visual: IP Address + Subnet Mask Example

| IP Address       | Subnet Mask      | Network Portion | Host Portion | Full Network ID |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 192.168.1.100   | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.1      | .100        | 192.168.1.0    |

- To calculate: IP AND Mask = Network ID (e.g., 192.168.1.100 AND 255.255.255.0 = 192.168.1.0).

This is a common home setup (/24 subnet, or CIDR notation 192.168.1.0/24). Larger masks (e.g., 255.255.255.252) mean smaller subnets with fewer hosts but more precise segmentation.

If you have a specific IP setup or want to calculate something (e.g., via code), share more details!
