## Translation

I normally write essays using one language. And then I use ChatGPT or DeepL to translate them into other languages. So for the essays after 2022.09, I mainly use English to write. And for the essays before 2022.09, I mainly used Chinese to write.

## Information Sensitivity

Sometimes I mention friends in essays to highlight points, drawing from public online content or observed behaviors. I discuss these anonymously, aiming to be constructive, with most references being positive or neutral.
