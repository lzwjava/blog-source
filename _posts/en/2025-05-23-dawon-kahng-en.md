**Dawon Kahng (강대원, May 4, 1931 – May 13, 1992) was a highly accomplished Korean-American electrical engineer and inventor who made groundbreaking contributions to the field of solid-state electronics.** Born in Seoul, Korea, during the period of Japanese rule, Kahng's intellectual curiosity and pursuit of knowledge led him to a transformative career in the United States.

Kahng's academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Seoul National University. In 1955, he immigrated to the United States to further his education, enrolling at Ohio State University. There, he excelled in his studies, earning both a Master's and a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering by 1959.

Upon completing his doctorate, Kahng joined the prestigious Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. This marked the beginning of a prolific period of research and innovation that would forever change the landscape of modern electronics.

**Kahng is most famously recognized for his co-invention of the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET)** in 1959, alongside his colleague Mohamed Atalla. This revolutionary device, often referred to as the MOS transistor, became the fundamental building block of modern integrated circuits and is the most widely used type of transistor in virtually all contemporary electronic equipment. Kahng and Atalla not only invented the MOSFET but also developed the crucial PMOS and NMOS fabrication processes that made its mass production feasible.

Beyond the MOSFET, Kahng continued to pioneer advancements in semiconductor technology. His significant contributions include:

* **The concept of the MOS Integrated Circuit:** Building upon their MOSFET work, Kahng and Atalla proposed the architecture for integrating multiple MOS transistors onto a single chip, laying the groundwork for the microelectronics revolution.
* **Pioneering work on Schottky Diodes:** In the early 1960s, Kahng and Atalla conducted groundbreaking research on Schottky barrier diodes, which are crucial components in high-frequency applications.
* **The Floating-Gate MOSFET (FGMOS):** In 1967, in collaboration with Simon Min Sze, Kahng invented the floating-gate MOSFET. This innovation led to the development of non-volatile memory cells, which are the foundation for EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory technologies that are ubiquitous in today's digital world.
* **Contributions to Electroluminescence:** Kahng also made significant contributions to the understanding and development of electroluminescent materials and devices.

In recognition of his profound impact on science and technology, Dawon Kahng received numerous accolades throughout his career, including the Stuart Ballantine Medal of the Franklin Institute. Posthumously, in 2009, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. The Korea Semiconductor Conference established the "Dawon Kahng Award" in 2017 to honor his legacy by recognizing significant contributions to the semiconductor industry.

After a distinguished career at Bell Laboratories, Kahng became the founding president of the NEC Research Institute in New Jersey in 1988, where he continued to foster innovative research in computing and communications until his untimely death in 1992.

**In summary, Dawon Kahng was a visionary Korean-born physicist and electrical engineer whose inventions, most notably the MOSFET and the floating-gate memory cell, have had an immeasurable and enduring impact on the world, underpinning the vast majority of modern electronics and information technology we rely on today.** His work continues to inspire and drive innovation in the semiconductor industry.
