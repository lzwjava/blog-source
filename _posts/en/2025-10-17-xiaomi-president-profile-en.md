### Who is Lu Weibing?

Lu Weibing (also known as William Lu) is a prominent Chinese tech executive, currently serving as Partner and President of Xiaomi Corporation. He is also the General Manager of the Redmi brand and President of Xiaomi's China Region. Born in September 1975 (some sources say 1976) in Henan Province, China, Lu graduated from Tsinghua University in 1998 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. He later earned an EMBA from Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business.

#### Early Career and Rise in Tech
Lu's professional journey began in the mobile industry, where he built expertise at companies like TCL and Gionee. In 2010, he became CEO of Gionee, a struggling Chinese smartphone maker. Under his leadership, he turned the company around by focusing on innovative designs and market expansion, significantly boosting its share in the domestic market. This success established him as a "turnaround specialist" in the competitive smartphone sector. He left Gionee in early 2019 after nearly a decade.

#### Role at Xiaomi and Redmi
In January 2019, Lu joined Xiaomi as Vice President and General Manager of the Redmi brand—a sub-brand targeting budget-conscious consumers with high-performance devices. He quickly made Redmi an independent operating unit, allowing faster innovation and decision-making. Key achievements include:
- Launching the blockbuster Redmi Note series, which became global bestsellers (e.g., dominating markets like India with a 14% share as of 2025).
- Relaunching Poco as a youth-focused sub-brand; the Poco F1 gained cult status for its "flagship-killing" specs at low prices.
- Driving Xiaomi to overtake Apple as the world's second-largest smartphone maker in Q2 2021.

Promoted to President of Xiaomi Group in 2020, Lu now oversees broader strategies, including the company's "Human x Car x Home" ecosystem (integrating smartphones, EVs, and smart home devices). He's been instrumental in R&D pushes, like the $4.11 billion (RMB 30 billion) investment in 2025, with RMB 7.5 billion for AI. Recent highlights include unveiling the Xiaomi Civi 5 Pro in 2025 and leading the Xiaomi 17 series to over 1 million sales in its first week.

Under Lu, Redmi shifted from a low-end label to a value-driven powerhouse, emphasizing performance, cameras (e.g., Leica partnerships), and affordability. He's active on social media (Weibo), often sharing updates like the upcoming Redmi K90 Pro Max launch in October 2025.

#### On "Failing 4 Times and Saving Redmi"
Regarding the anecdote about Lu failing 4 times before saving Redmi, extensive searches didn't uncover specific details matching this— it may stem from unverified stories, mistranslations, or references to early career hurdles (e.g., Gionee's later post-Lu struggles or general industry challenges like supply chain issues). However, Lu's track record demonstrates resilience: He inherited and revitalized Redmi during a tough period for budget Android brands, making it a profit engine for Xiaomi. Critics point to occasional challenges like shorter software update cycles compared to rivals, but his leadership has undeniably "saved" and elevated Redmi into a global contender.

Lu is often called Xiaomi's "No. 2" after founder Lei Jun, praised for his consumer-focused, aggressive style.
