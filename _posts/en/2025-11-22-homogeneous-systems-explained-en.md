title: Homogeneous and Non-Homogeneous Systems Explained

In the context of a homogeneous system like **Ax = 0**, "homogeneous" specifically means that the **right-hand side is zero**.

To clarify the distinction:

**Homogeneous system:** Ax = 0 (the constant term is zero)

**Non-homogeneous system:** Ax = b (where b ≠ 0, the constant term is non-zero)

The word "homogeneous" essentially means "uniform" or "of the same kind." In this case, it refers to having zero on the right-hand side of all equations.

**Key implications of a homogeneous system:**

A homogeneous system always has at least one solution: the trivial solution **x = 0** (the zero vector). This is guaranteed because substituting zero into any equation gives 0 = 0, which is always true.

The interesting question for a homogeneous system is whether it has **non-trivial solutions** (solutions other than x = 0). This happens when the matrix A is singular (not invertible), which means its columns are linearly dependent and the system has infinitely many solutions.

In contrast, a non-homogeneous system Ax = b may have no solution, exactly one solution, or infinitely many solutions—it doesn't automatically have a solution at all.
