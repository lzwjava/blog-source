title: Fixing Fn + F5 in VSCode on Mac
translated: false
type: note
---

If pressing **Fn + F5** on your Mac in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) has no effect when trying to launch the **Extension Development Host**, it’s likely due to how the `Fn` key and function keys are configured on your Mac, a conflict in VSCode keybindings, or a misconfiguration in your extension development setup. Below, I’ll explain why this might be happening and how to fix it.

### Why **Fn + F5** Doesn’t Work on Your Mac

1. **Mac Function Key Behavior**:
   - On Mac keyboards, the function keys (F1–F12) are often assigned to system functions by default (e.g., F5 might control keyboard brightness or media playback).
   - The `Fn` key is used to access the “standard” function key behavior (e.g., `Fn + F5` sends the actual F5 key signal instead of a system function).
   - If `Fn + F5` isn’t triggering the expected action in VSCode, your Mac’s keyboard settings or VSCode’s keybindings may not be interpreting the input correctly.

2. **VSCode Keybinding Conflict or Misconfiguration**:
   - VSCode may not have `F5` (or `Fn + F5`) mapped to the “Run Extension” command for launching the Extension Development Host.
   - Another extension or custom keybinding might be overriding `F5`.

3. **Extension Development Setup Issue**:
   - If your VSCode extension project isn’t properly configured (e.g., missing or incorrect `launch.json`), pressing `F5` (with or without `Fn`) won’t launch the Extension Development Host.

4. **macOS System Settings**:
   - macOS might be intercepting the `F5` key for a system function, or the `Fn` key behavior might be customized in a way that affects VSCode’s ability to detect it.

### Steps to Fix **Fn + F5** Not Working in VSCode on Mac

#### 1. **Check macOS Keyboard Settings**
   - **Enable Standard Function Key Behavior**:
     - Go to **System Settings > Keyboard**.
     - Check the box for **“Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys”**.
     - If enabled, you can press `F5` directly (without `Fn`) to send the F5 key signal to VSCode. Try pressing `F5` alone to see if it launches the Extension Development Host.
     - If unchecked, you need to press `Fn + F5` to send F5, as F5 alone may control a system function (e.g., keyboard brightness).
   - **Test F5 Behavior**:
     - Open a text editor (e.g., TextEdit) and press `F5` and `Fn + F5`. If `F5` alone triggers a system action (like brightness), and `Fn + F5` does nothing, the `Fn` key is working as expected to send the standard F5 signal.
   - **Reset NVRAM/PRAM** (if needed):
     - Restart your Mac and hold `Cmd + Option + P + R` until you hear the startup chime twice (or the Apple logo appears twice on newer Macs). This resets keyboard-related settings and may resolve detection issues.

#### 2. **Verify VSCode Keybindings**
   - Open VSCode and go to **Code > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts** (`Cmd+K, Cmd+S`).
   - In the search bar, type `F5` or `Run Extension`.
   - Look for the command **“Debug: Start Debugging”** or **“Run Extension”** (associated with launching the Extension Development Host).
   - Ensure it’s mapped to `F5`. If not, double-click the command, press `F5` (or `Fn + F5` if required), and save the new keybinding.
   - Check for conflicts: Search for other commands bound to `F5` or `Fn + F5` and remove or reassign them.
   - Reset keybindings if needed: Click the three dots (`...`) in the Keyboard Shortcuts editor and select **Reset Keybindings**.

#### 3. **Check Your Extension Project Configuration**
   - Ensure your extension project is set up correctly:
     - Open your extension project folder in VSCode (must contain `package.json` and `extension.js` or equivalent).
     - Verify `package.json` has the required fields:
       ```json
       {
         "name": "your-extension-name",
         "displayName": "Your Extension Name",
         "version": "0.0.1",
         "engines": {
           "vscode": "^1.60.0"
         },
         "categories": ["Other"],
         "activationEvents": ["*"],
         "main": "./extension.js"
       }
       ```
   - Check for a `.vscode/launch.json` file:
     - If it doesn’t exist, VSCode should create one when you press `F5`. If not, create it manually in the `.vscode` folder with:
       ```json
       {
         "version": "0.2.0",
         "configurations": [
           {
             "name": "Run Extension",
             "type": "extensionHost",
             "request": "launch",
             "args": ["--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"],
             "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/out/**/*.js"],
             "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch"
           }
         ]
       }
       ```
     - Ensure the `preLaunchTask` (e.g., `npm: watch`) matches a task in `.vscode/tasks.json` if you’re using TypeScript or a build step.
   - Run `npm install` in the VSCode terminal (`Cmd+``) to ensure dependencies (e.g., `@types/vscode`) are installed.

#### 4. **Test Launching the Extension Development Host**
   - With your extension project open, try pressing `F5` (or `Fn + F5` if the “Use F1, F2, etc. as standard function keys” setting is off).
   - Alternatively, open the **Run and Debug** panel (`Cmd+Shift+D`), select **“Run Extension”** from the dropdown, and click the green play button.
   - If the Extension Development Host doesn’t launch:
     - Check the **Output** panel (`Cmd+Shift+U`) and select **“Extension”** from the dropdown to see any errors.
     - Check the **Debug Console** for errors related to your extension or the debug process.
     - Ensure Node.js is installed (`node -v` in the terminal) and your project has no syntax errors.

#### 5. **Test with a Different Keyboard**
   - Connect an external USB keyboard to your Mac and press `F5` (or `Fn + F5`) in VSCode.
   - If it works, the issue may be with your Mac’s built-in keyboard hardware or firmware. Check for keyboard firmware updates via your Mac’s manufacturer (e.g., Apple Software Update).

#### 6. **Update VSCode and macOS**
   - Ensure VSCode is up to date: Go to **Code > Check for Updates** or download the latest version from the VSCode website.
   - Update macOS: Go to **System Settings > General > Software Update** to install any available updates, as they may include keyboard driver fixes.

#### 7. **Disable Interfering Extensions or Software**
   - **VSCode Extensions**:
     - Disable all extensions: Run `code --disable-extensions` in a terminal, then open VSCode and try `F5` again.
     - If it works, re-enable extensions one by one to identify the culprit.
   - **Third-Party Software**:
     - Check for keyboard remapping tools like Karabiner-Elements or BetterTouchTool. Open their settings and ensure `F5` or `Fn + F5` isn’t remapped.
     - Temporarily disable these tools to test.

#### 8. **Debugging Logs**
   - Enable VSCode developer tools to inspect key events:
     - Open VSCode, press `Cmd+Option+I` to open the Developer Tools.
     - Go to the **Console** tab and press `Fn + F5`. Look for key event logs to see if VSCode is receiving the correct input.
   - If no key event is logged, the issue is likely at the system level (macOS or keyboard hardware).

### If the Issue Persists
   - Provide more details:
     - macOS version (e.g., Ventura, Sonoma).
     - VSCode version (check via **Code > About Visual Studio Code**).
     - Keyboard type (e.g., MacBook built-in, external keyboard model).
     - Whether `F5` or `Fn + F5` works in other apps (e.g., does `F5` refresh a browser?).
     - Any error messages in the VSCode **Output** or **Debug Console**.
   - Try creating a minimal extension project to isolate the issue:
     - Run `yo code` (requires Yeoman and VSCode generator: `npm install -g yo generator-code`) to scaffold a new extension.
     - Open the new project in VSCode and press `F5` to see if it launches the Extension Development Host.
