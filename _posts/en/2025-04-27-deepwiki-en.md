Try the DeepWiki: [https://deepwiki.com/lzwjava/lzwjava.github.io](https://deepwiki.com/lzwjava/lzwjava.github.io).

The architecture diagrams are quite good.

When my article is a post about investing in GitHub Actions, it's a Markdown article with some code. The AI doesn't know this is just a post. So when I ask what the cron job of this repo is, it will include it.

It's really easy for AI to make this mistake. They are fed tons of information and don't always categorize it correctly, especially in deeply nested cases.

DeepWiki reminds me of a tool to analyze one's Twitter posts and determine the character traits they reveal.

Naturally, it encourages developers to share. It helps to index their repositories.

The Devin AI Tool doesn't receive much recognition because it is too expensive to try. However, this one is free.

Perhaps in the future, there will be DeepBook, DeepBlog, and DeepWebsite, using similar indexing and analytics technologies that DeepWiki demonstrates.
