Elon Musk has openly discussed his experiences with negative thoughts, internal struggles, and what he describes as a "negative chemical state in the brain" (essentially, episodes of depression not tied to external events). In a 2024 interview (clip shared widely on X in October 2025), he explained his approach to emerging from these states:

> "There are times when I have sort of a ... negative chemical state in my brain, like depression I guess, or depression that's not linked to any negative news, and ketamine is helpful for getting one out of the negative frame of mind."

He elaborated that ketamine (a prescription he's used under medical supervision) acts as a tool to interrupt and reset these cycles, helping him shift out of unproductive negativity without relying solely on traditional antidepressants, which he said didn't work as well for him. Musk emphasized this as part of a broader strategy: focusing on controllable actions (like work and problem-solving) while acknowledging the biochemical reality of such struggles. He doesn't frame it as a universal cure but as something effective for his high-stress life.

This ties into his recurring advice on ego management and resilience—e.g., "always be smashing your ego" and internalizing responsibility to avoid self-pity or blame spirals (from a 2025 startup talk). For sensitivity or inferiority feelings, he often points to not seeking external validation: "It's a real weakness to want to be liked... and I do not have that."
