Short answer: It works, but it’s not the best for noodles.

What your method does well
- Less active time at the stove
- You get veggies and egg (better nutrition than just hot water + noodles)

Main downsides
- Texture: noodles keep soaking and get very soft/mushy; veggies go limp; egg overcooks
- Flavor: broth can taste flat after long sitting
- Food safety: 40 minutes is usually okay, but warm food sits in the “danger zone” as it cools. Safer to eat soon or reheat to a boil before eating.

Smarter ways with the same convenience
1) Separate broth and noodles
- Boil water. Add hard vegetables (carrot, cabbage stems) 2–3 min.
- Add seasoning and egg (poach 3–4 min or stir for egg ribbons).
- Turn off heat and cover; broth/veg/egg can wait.
- When ready to eat: bring broth back to a boil, add noodles 2–3 min. Eat.
- Result: only 3–5 min active time at the end; noodles stay bouncy.

2) Undercook + insulate (if you must leave)
- Cook as you do, but add noodles for only 1–2 min (undercook).
- Turn off heat, transfer to an insulated container (thermos/food jar), close.
- Eat within 20–30 min. Noodles finish gently but won’t get as mushy.

3) Prep ahead
- Boil eggs ahead (jammy or hard). Blanch veggies 30–60 sec, chill.
- At mealtime: boil water, cook noodles 2–3 min, add seasoning, add prepped egg/veg to warm 30 sec. Done in ~5 min.

Extra tips
- Veg order: hard veg first; mushrooms next; leafy greens last 30–60 sec.
- Noodle choice: thicker or fresh wheat noodles handle waiting better than very thin instant noodles.
- If food sat 30–40 min and cooled, bring it back to a full boil for 1 minute before eating.
- Always turn off the gas fully; if resting on the stove, keep the lid on so it stays hot.

So, your way is efficient, but for better taste and safety, cook the broth/veg/egg first and drop in the noodles right before you eat. You still save time, and the bowl will be much better.
