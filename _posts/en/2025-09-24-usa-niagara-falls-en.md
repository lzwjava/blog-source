### Introduction to Niagara Falls on the USA Side

Niagara Falls is one of the world's most iconic natural wonders, a massive waterfall system straddling the border between the United States and Canada. The falls consist of three main cascades: the American Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, and the much larger Horseshoe Falls (which is primarily on the Canadian side). Since you visited the Canadian side in September 2017 and had that visa hiccup (sorry to hear about the police escort back—border rules can be strict!), I'll focus on the USA side this time. It's a fantastic alternative with plenty of stunning views, adventure activities, and easier access if you're traveling within the US or have a valid ESTA/visa for entry. September is indeed an ideal time—crowds are thinner post-summer, the weather is mild (around 60-70°F/15-21°C), and the fall colors start to pop.

#### Getting There from New York
Starting from New York City, the train is a scenic and relaxing option. Amtrak's Empire Service or Maple Leaf routes run from Penn Station to Niagara Falls, NY (USA side), taking about 8-9 hours, just like you mentioned. 
- **Schedule and Cost**: Trains depart multiple times daily; a one-way ticket typically costs $50-150 USD depending on the class (economy is fine for most) and how far in advance you book via Amtrak's app or website. The Maple Leaf route hugs the Hudson River and offers beautiful views through upstate New York.
- **Arrival**: You'll arrive at the Niagara Falls Amtrak station, about a 10-15 minute ride from the main attractions. Taxis, rideshares (Uber/Lyft), or the local WEGO bus system are cheap and convenient—expect $10-20 to get to your hotel or the falls.
- **Pro Tip**: If you're prone to motion sickness, opt for a window seat on the left side for river views. Pack snacks, as the cafe car has options but isn't gourmet.

#### What to See and Do on the USA Side
The American side centers around Niagara Falls State Park (established in 1855, it's the oldest state park in the US and a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Unlike the Canadian side's high-rise hotels and fireworks shows, the US experience feels more rugged and nature-focused, with fewer crowds and a emphasis on the raw power of the falls. Entry to the park is free, but some attractions have fees.

Key highlights:
- **Observation Points**: Start at Prospect Point for jaw-dropping views of the American Falls (110 feet/34m high) and Bridal Veil Falls. Walk the pedestrian paths or take the Niagara Scenic Trolley ($3-5 round-trip) for easy hopping around.
- **Cave of the Winds**: This is a must-do—wear provided ponchos and sandals to walk right up to the base of Bridal Veil Falls. The mist and roar are exhilarating! Tickets: ~$21 USD, book online to skip lines.
- **Maid of the Mist Boat Tour**: Board a boat from the US side to sail into the basin at the falls' base (ponchos included to combat the spray). It's a thrilling 20-minute ride feeling the full force of the water. ~$28 USD; runs seasonally (April-October).
- **Niagara SkyWheel and Other Fun**: If you want a bird's-eye view, head to the nearby Niagara Falls USA Welcome Center area for the 175-foot SkyWheel (~$15). For adventure, try the Zipline to the Falls (drops you 2,200 feet toward the water) or white-water rafting on the Niagara Gorge (~$60-100).
- **Hiking and Nature**: Explore the park's trails, like the Devil's Hole Trail for gorge views, or visit the Niagara Power Vista (free) to learn about the hydroelectric history—it's educational without being stuffy.

#### Practical Tips for Your Trip
- **Visa/Entry**: Since you're heading to the US side, if you're a US citizen or have a valid ESTA (for Visa Waiver Program countries), you're good. Double-check at the border if coming internationally. No issues crossing state lines domestically.
- **Lodging**: Stay in the park area for convenience—options like the Red Coach Inn or Giacomo (historic vibes) run $150-300/night in September. Or budget-friendly motels in town for $100+.
- **Food and Accessibility**: Great spots like the Hard Rock Cafe or Top of the Falls Restaurant for views and casual eats (try the buffalo wings—it's Niagara County, after all!). The park is wheelchair-friendly with ramps and shuttles.
- **Duration**: A full day is enough for highlights, but 2 days lets you relax. Watch for the nightly Illuminations (colorful lights on the falls at dusk—free from any viewpoint).
- **Weather and Packing**: September can be cool and misty, so bring layers, rain gear, and comfy shoes for walking. Download the Niagara Falls USA app for maps and real-time updates.

The USA side offers a more intimate encounter with the falls' majesty without the international border hassle— you'll love rediscovering it! If you have specifics like budget, group size, or interests (e.g., hiking vs. thrills), I can refine this further. Safe travels!
