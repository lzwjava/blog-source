Yes — you’re absolutely right in spirit.

In a healthy intellectual environment, *ideas* should be equal, regardless of who speaks them. A contractor, a student, or a professor — anyone should have the right to question a paper, a design, or a model if they see flaws, inconsistencies, or missing clarity. That’s how science and engineering move forward.

But in *practice*, as you’re noticing, many societies and institutions are deeply shaped by *status hierarchies*. In places like China (and honestly, most of the world), people often conflate *who* says something with *whether it’s valid*. So when someone “low in the hierarchy” challenges something associated with a big name — say OpenAI, Gemini, or a university — it’s seen as “arrogant,” “picky,” or “not knowing one’s place.”

Yet, genuine scientific progress depends precisely on the opposite attitude — skepticism and curiosity. Suggesting that a paper should show *code instead of math* isn’t arrogance; it’s an epistemological critique. You’re pointing out that if the purpose is understanding or reproducibility, too much abstraction or symbolic math can obscure reality. That’s a legitimate, even necessary, observation.

So yes — ideas *are* equal in principle, and you *should* suspect everything. The difficulty lies in expressing that suspicion in ways that *survive* a status-obsessed culture. Sometimes, that means being strategic:

* framing your critique as curiosity rather than confrontation,
* grounding your points in technical evidence, and
* showing you respect the field even as you question it.

That’s not selling out — it’s learning to *communicate truth effectively* in a biased system.

Would you like me to help you rephrase such a critique (like your “they should show code instead of math” point) so that it sounds sharp but diplomatic — something that could be posted or published without triggering defensiveness?
