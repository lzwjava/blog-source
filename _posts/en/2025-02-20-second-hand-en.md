title: Buy Cheap Second-Hand Goods

- Pay around 30 CNY to buy second-hand radios, mobile phones, smart watches, routers, etc.

- Dismantle things to learn how they work.

- Knowledge is precious.

- When I did so, after getting some products like a wireless speaker or a Xiaomi Wi-Fi device, which were released almost 10 years ago, they still worked well. This disappoints me because I want them to stop working so I can dismantle them without feeling like I'm wasting things.
