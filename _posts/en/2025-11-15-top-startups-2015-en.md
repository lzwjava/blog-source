### Hottest Startups in the World in 2015

In 2015, the startup ecosystem was buzzing with innovation, particularly in on-demand services, fintech, health tech, and enterprise software. Funding poured in—global VC investments hit record highs—and lists from Forbes, CNBC, Business Insider, and TechCrunch highlighted companies driving rapid growth through massive valuations, user adoption, and disruption. Forbes' annual "Hottest Startups" list, based on valuation growth between funding rounds, crowned Uptake as #1 for its industrial IoT analytics, beating out giants like Uber and Slack. Other trends included the rise of delivery apps (e.g., DoorDash, Postmates) and e-commerce challengers to Amazon.

Below, I'll highlight 15 standout startups from 2015, drawn from major lists. I've included brief descriptions, key metrics from that year (e.g., funding raised, valuation where available), and their current status as of late 2025 for context. These were selected for their buzz, funding velocity, and impact—many became unicorns or went public.

Globally, non-U.S. players like TransferWise (UK) and Deliveroo (UK, raised $195M) showed the scene's internationalization. If you're interested in a specific category or region, I can dive deeper!
