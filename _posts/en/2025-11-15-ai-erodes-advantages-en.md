You're hitting on a real and accelerating trend: the combination of AI (especially foundation models, open-source tools, cheap compute, and no-code/low-code infrastructure) is dramatically lowering the barrier for small teams to build world-class products. This is exposing the structural weaknesses of large corporations faster than ever before. Let’s break it down.

### Why big companies/banks are increasingly vulnerable
1. **Incentive misalignment**  
   - Most employees (especially below director/VP level) have tiny or zero equity.  
   - Bonuses are capped, politics-heavy, and often decoupled from actual impact.  
   - Contractors (sometimes 30-50% of the workforce in banks/tech giants) have zero skin in the game.

2. **Bureaucracy & slow decision cycles**  
   - 9-5 culture + endless meetings + cross-team dependencies = 6–18 months to ship something a 5-person startup ships in 6 weeks.

3. **Talent concentration at the top is aging out**  
   - Many senior leaders built their careers in a pre-AI, pre-cloud, or pre-mobile world. They rose through politics + execution in a slower environment.  
   - They often block risky bets because their personal downside (reputation, bonus) is higher than upside.

4. **Regulatory moats are weakening**  
   - Banks used to be protected by compliance barriers. Now fintech/neobank startups (Revolut, Chime, Nubank, Mercury) + embedded finance + DeFi are eating the margins.  
   - AI regulation is still chaotic → first-mover startups get years of runway before bigco compliance teams even finish the risk assessment.

### Why startups (especially AI-native ones) are eating the world again
- A team of 10–50 people can now train or fine-tune models that rival what Google/FB spent billions on five years ago.
- Open-source (Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, etc.) + inference APIs (Groq, Together, Fireworks) = near-zero capex.
- Distribution is free/cheap: Product Hunt, X, TikTok, Discord communities.
- Equity is concentrated → everyone rows hard. Top engineers at OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, xAI, etc., have 0.5–5%+ of a potential $10B–$200B outcome. That’s life-changing money for a 3–7 year bet.

We’re already seeing the pattern you mentioned:  
- Sam Altman (ex-YC), Emmett Shear/Dario Amodei (ex-OpenAI), Alexandr Wang (ex-Quora), etc. → all relatively junior/mid-level before founding unicorns/deca-unicorns.
- In finance:  
  - Ramp (ex-Brex, ex-Parafin engineers) → $8B+ valuation  
  - Brex founders were ex-Stanford undergrads who interned at banks  
  - Adyen, Stripe, Plaid, Chime → all started by people who were nowhere near “senior” in bigco terms.

### So what will company structure look like in 5–10 years?
Several models are emerging:

1. **The “10x Engineer Microcorp” (5–80 people, $1B–$100B+ valuations)**  
   - Fully remote, extreme equity concentration (founders + first 30 employees own 70-90%).  
   - No middle management. Only “makers” and maybe one layer of “coordinators.”  
   - Examples today: Midjourney (~40 people, profitable, $ billions in implied value), Replicate, Perplexity, Cursor.

2. **The “Studio / AI Lab” model**  
   - 50–300 people, multiple bets under one roof (like Constellation, CreatorDAO-style, or the old Expa).  
   - Heavy use of contractors + bounty systems instead of traditional employees.

3. **The “BigCo that learned” – rare but possible**  
   - Some giants (Meta with Llama, Tesla with Dojo/FSD, maybe Amazon with Olympus) are carving out skunkworks that operate like startups internally (separate cap table, high equity, kill-decisions every 6 months).  
   - Most fail at this, but the ones that succeed stay relevant.

4. **The “Protocol / Open-Source Core + Commercial Arms” model**  
   - Core model is open-source (Llama, O1 replicas, etc.).  
   - Dozens of 20-person companies build vertical applications on top and reach $1B–$20B each.  
   - Think Shopify app store but for AI agents.

5. **Return of the “Lifestyle Unicorn”**  
   - $100M–$3B revenue, 50–200 employees, 40–60% EBITDA margins, no desire to IPO.  
   - Owners cash-flow $50M–$500M/year personally. Already happening (Hugging Face, Supabase, Vercel, etc.).

### Bottom line
The era where “big = safe = winner” is dying fast. In AI especially, the half-life of advantage is measured in months, not decades. The people who actually build the future will increasingly be:
- small teams,
- with extreme ownership,
- shipping weekly,
- compensated like founders.

Big companies will keep most of the money for a while (inertia + regulatory moats + brand), but they will increasingly become the “old money” that gets disrupted by waves of new entrants—exactly like you said: kids who were mid-level engineers at Google, Meta, or Goldman two years ago are now starting the next OpenAI/Stripe/Palantir.

The 2030 Forbes list is being written right now in Discord servers and 20-person offices. Most of today’s FAANG middle managers won’t even recognize the company names in 5–7 years.
