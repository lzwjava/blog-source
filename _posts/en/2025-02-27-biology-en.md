Below is a concise, 100-point summary of key topics, principles, and terms typically covered in a high school (or introductory) biology course. Each point aims to highlight an essential concept relevant to foundational biology studies.

---

1. Biology: The scientific study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment.

2. Cell Theory: 
   1) All living things are composed of cells,  
   2) Cells are the basic units of life,  
   3) New cells arise from existing cells.

3. Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes:  
   - Prokaryotes lack a membrane-bound nucleus (e.g., bacteria).  
   - Eukaryotes have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles (e.g., plant and animal cells).

4. Cell Membrane: A phospholipid bilayer that regulates what enters and leaves the cell.

5. Cytoplasm: The jelly-like substance within a cell, containing organelles and cytosol.

6. Nucleus: The control center of a eukaryotic cell, containing the cell’s genetic material (DNA).

7. Mitochondria: Organelles responsible for cellular respiration and energy (ATP) production.

8. Chloroplasts: Organelles in plant cells that carry out photosynthesis.

9. Ribosomes: Sites of protein synthesis; can be free in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

10. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): A network of membranes; rough ER synthesizes proteins, smooth ER synthesizes lipids.

16. Osmosis: The diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane.

17. Active Transport: Movement of substances against their concentration gradient, requiring energy (ATP).

18. Photosynthesis: Conversion of light energy, CO₂, and H₂O into glucose and O₂ (occurs in chloroplasts).

19. Cellular Respiration: The breakdown of glucose to produce ATP; includes glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.

27. Proteins: Polymers of amino acids; serve as enzymes, structural components, transport molecules, and more.

28. Nucleic Acids: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid); store and transmit genetic information.

29. DNA Structure: A double helix made up of nucleotide subunits (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine).

30. RNA: Single-stranded nucleic acid involved in protein synthesis (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA).

31. Replication: The process by which DNA makes a copy of itself before cell division.

32. Transcription: DNA is used to synthesize messenger RNA (mRNA).

35. Chromosomes: DNA molecules wrapped around proteins; carry genetic information.

36. Chromosome Number:  
   - Haploid (n) cells have one set of chromosomes (e.g., gametes).  
   - Diploid (2n) cells have pairs of chromosomes (e.g., somatic cells).

37. Cell Cycle: The series of events in cell growth and division; includes interphase and mitosis.

38. Interphase: G₁ (growth), S (DNA replication), and G₂ (preparation for division).

39. Mitosis: Division of the nucleus into two identical daughter nuclei (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase).

40. Cytokinesis: Division of the cell’s cytoplasm, resulting in two separate cells.

41. Meiosis: Special cell division producing gametes (sperm, eggs); halves the chromosome number.

42. Genetics: The study of heredity and variation.

43. Mendel’s Laws:  
   - Law of Segregation: Alleles separate during gamete formation.  
   - Law of Independent Assortment: Genes for different traits sort independently.

44. Alleles: Different versions of a gene.

45. Dominant vs. Recessive: Dominant alleles mask recessive alleles in heterozygous conditions.

46. Genotype: The genetic makeup (e.g., AA, Aa, aa).

47. Phenotype: The observable characteristics (e.g., flower color).

48. Homozygous vs. Heterozygous:  
   - Homozygous: two identical alleles (AA or aa).  
   - Heterozygous: two different alleles (Aa).

49. Punnett Square: A tool to predict offspring genotype and phenotype ratios.

50. Codominance: Both alleles are fully expressed in heterozygotes (e.g., AB blood type).

51. Incomplete Dominance: Heterozygote has an intermediate phenotype (e.g., pink flowers from red and white parents).

52. Sex-Linked Traits: Traits carried on sex chromosomes (often the X chromosome).

53. Pedigree: A diagram tracing the inheritance of a trait through generations.

54. Mutation: A change in the DNA sequence; can be harmful, beneficial, or neutral.

55. Evolution: Change in allele frequencies within a population over time.
