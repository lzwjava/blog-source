Below is a concise, 100-point summary of key ideas and concepts typically covered in high school physics. Each point highlights an essential topic, principle, or term relevant to foundational physics studies.

---

1. Physics: The study of matter, energy, and the fundamental forces governing the universe.

2. Units of Measurement: Commonly use SI units (meter, kilogram, second, kelvin, ampere, etc.).

3. Scalars and Vectors: Scalars have magnitude only (e.g., speed, mass), while vectors have both magnitude and direction (e.g., velocity, force).

4. Distance vs. Displacement: Distance is the total path length traveled; displacement is the straight-line change in position.

5. Speed vs. Velocity: Speed is distance per unit time; velocity is displacement per unit time (vector).

6. Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity; can be positive (speeding up) or negative (slowing down).

7. Uniform Motion: Constant velocity (zero acceleration).

8. Uniformly Accelerated Motion: Constant acceleration (e.g., free fall under gravity near Earth’s surface).

9. Kinematic Equations: Describe motion with constant acceleration (e.g., $ v = v_0 + at $, $ s = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $).

10. Free Fall: Motion under gravitational acceleration alone, typically $ g \approx 9.8\,\text{m/s}^2 $ near Earth’s surface.

11. Newton’s First Law (Law of Inertia): An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion continues in motion unless acted on by a net external force.

12. Newton’s Second Law: $ F = ma $, where force equals mass times acceleration.

13. Newton’s Third Law: Every action force has an equal and opposite reaction force.

14. Mass vs. Weight: Mass is the amount of matter (in kg); weight is the gravitational force on that mass (in Newtons).

35. Simple Machines: Devices that change the magnitude or direction of force (inclined plane, lever, wheel and axle, pulley, wedge, screw).

36. Circular Motion: Motion in a circle at constant speed has acceleration directed toward the center (centripetal acceleration).

37. Centripetal Force: Net force required for uniform circular motion, $ F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} $.

38. Rotation vs. Revolution: Rotation is spinning about an internal axis; revolution is orbiting around an external axis.
