### Easy Chinese Stuffed Dough: Guo Kui (Crispy Stuffed Flatbread)

If you're after a distinctly Chinese option that's stuffed dough but skips the steaming of baozi or boiling/frying of dumplings, try **Guo Kui** (锅盔). This Sichuan-style flatbread is crispy, layered, and savory—like a handheld beef pancake. It's street food that's surprisingly simple at home, using basic pantry staples and no yeast or special tools.

#### Why easy?
No rising time, just a quick-rest dough and pan-frying. Assembly is like wrapping a burrito but flatter. Total time: ~1 hour 15 min (including rests; active ~45 min). Makes 10 pieces.

#### Quick recipe:
**Ingredients (dough):**  
- 500g all-purpose flour  
- 300g water  
- Oil for coating  

**Flour-oil paste:**  
- 3 tbsp flour + pinch salt  
- 3 tbsp hot oil  

**Filling:**  
- 280g ground beef (or pork/chicken; higher fat = juicier)  
- 4 tbsp water  
- 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)  
- 1 tsp salt + ¼ tsp white pepper  
- 1 tbsp ground Sichuan pepper (or five-spice/cumin)  
- 6 scallions, chopped fine  

1. **Dough:** Mix flour and water into a soft dough (add water gradually). Knead 5 min until smooth, rest covered 10 min. Oil lightly, divide into 10 pieces, rest 30 min.  
2. **Paste:** Mix flour/salt, pour smoking-hot oil over it, stir smooth.  
3. **Filling:** Stir beef with water/wine/salt/pepper until sticky (like meat paste). Divide into 10 portions.  
4. **Assemble:** Flatten each dough piece into a thin oval. Brush with paste, sprinkle Sichuan pepper. Mound filling + scallions in center, wrap dough around like a cigar, then coil/roll flat into ½-inch discs.  
5. **Cook:** Heat oil in skillet over medium. Fry discs 4 min per side until golden and crispy (add water lid-trick if baking from frozen). Drain on paper.  

Serve hot with chili oil or as-is—crunchy outside, juicy spiced beef inside. Customize with veggies or different spices. Pro tip: Stretch dough thin for extra layers!
