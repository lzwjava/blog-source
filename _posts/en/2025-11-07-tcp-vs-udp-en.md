Yes, you've got it exactly right! Let me clarify the key differences:

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - Connection-oriented:**
- Establishes a connection before sending data (like a "handshake")
- Sends packets and **waits for acknowledgements** from the receiver
- If acknowledgement isn't received, it **resends the packet**
- Guarantees delivery and correct order of packets
- Like sending a registered letter where you get a receipt confirmation

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - Connectionless:**
- **No connection establishment** - just sends packets directly
- **No acknowledgements** - fire and forget
- **No guarantee** that packets arrive or arrive in order
- Much faster because there's less overhead
- Like dropping a postcard in the mailbox without tracking

**Use cases:**
- **TCP:** Web browsing, email, file transfers - anything where you need reliable delivery
- **UDP:** Video streaming, online gaming, voice calls - where speed matters more than perfect delivery (a few lost packets won't ruin the experience)

So yes, your understanding is correct - the main difference is that TCP has that acknowledgement/confirmation mechanism, while UDP just sends the data once without checking if it arrived!
