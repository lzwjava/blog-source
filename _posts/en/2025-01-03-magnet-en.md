After buying [Blood Pressure Monitor, Stethoscope, and Vision Chart](./health-tools-en) tools to learn, I wanted to buy more interesting things.

One of them is magnets. Nikola Tesla once said, "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration."

Magnets are about energy. I used an AI tool to create 100 points of high school physics. I want to find time to walk through them.

After receiving my toy magnets, I decided to give half of the magnet pieces to my daughter. She liked them and picked the magnet car and the big U-shaped magnet, leaving me with two small round magnets and one line-shaped magnet.

After 10 minutes, she said that the big U-shaped magnet had broken into two parts as it fell from a height.

I took a picture after we agreed on which parts belonged to her and which parts belonged to me.

At dinner, I taught her about magnets, etc. I used my mobile phone to use the app Photoroom to remove the background of the photo. I told her that the principle of the robot dog she saw in the basketball court of our apartment community is the same as the principle of the background removal of this app.

I told her about the YOLO algorithm and object detection. I can foresee that when she goes to school to learn about magnets in her physics class, she will probably recall this conversation.
