* Cooking for yourself is simple. Use oil for stir-frying because it has a higher boiling point than water, which helps heat the food more effectively.  

* It is easy to make a dish with meat, vegetables, chili, garlic, and ginger.  

* A vegetable chopper is a very useful tool. It can chop vegetables into cubes, slices, or strips, and can be used for tasks such as slicing potatoes or creating small granules from peppers.

* Making soup is easy with an electric cooker. Add the ingredients, season with salt, set the timer, and let it cook.  

* Soup with Chinese yam is great because it cooks easily in the soup and makes the soup thick. Carrots, daikon, and tomatoes are also good ingredients for this soup.

* A grill oven can be used to make egg tarts, lamb, beef, pork, hot dogs, mushrooms, and more. For meat, set the temperature to 200°C and cook for about 20 minutes.  

* For outdoor cooking, you’ll need a fire. Dried leaves can be used to start the fire. Find a container to hold the food for cooking, or even use a tile as a makeshift pot.  

* A rice cooker can also be used to heat food, not just rice. However, keep in mind that vegetables tend to release water, which can make the rice too wet. Add only a small amount of water if you’re cooking vegetables in the rice cooker.  

* A cooking robot is a convenient tool for making dishes. Simply add the ingredients and let the robot handle the stirring.

* We need to understand how long each ingredient needs to be stir-fried. Broccoli requires more time, while mushrooms and meat need less time. 

* If we cook them together, the different cooking times will result in some ingredients being overcooked and others being undercooked. The order in which we add ingredients to the pan matters.

* We should minimize washing the pot between dishes and can stir-fry some foods together.

* We can apply the same process or function to similar objects or items with the same characteristics. This applies to both cooking and programming.

* Ingredients that are heated in a grill oven can be coated with cornflour and light soy sauce. Using fruit juice to marinate is also acceptable, such as lemon, orange, or apple juice.

* We cut meat or other ingredients into small pieces to allow them to be heated more effectively in the pot. Therefore, it is different to prepare for making soup, which may accept larger pieces of ingredients.

* The most important thing about cooking is make food cooked fully to safe to eat. 

* Using a grill oven instead of an electric steamer means that it doesn't involve water to heat food, which makes the food dry. 

* A mortar and pestle is a great tool to crush garlic. 

* Do not use too much salt, especially if the ingredients are already coated with soy sauce.

* Meat usually does not need to be washed again. People tend to over-wash ingredients; there is no need to clean them thoroughly with water. We just need to ensure the ingredients are fresh.

* Parchment paper is better than aluminum foil because it won't stick to the cooking surface.
