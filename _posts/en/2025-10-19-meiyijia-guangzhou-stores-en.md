**Approximately 2,817 Meiyijia convenience stores in Guangzhou as of July 2025.**

Meiyijia (美宜佳), a leading Chinese convenience store chain headquartered in Dongguan, Guangdong, has a strong presence in the province, with Guangzhou ranking third among Guangdong cities for store count (behind Dongguan and Shenzhen). This figure comes from a July 2025 ranking of stores across 14 Guangdong cities. Given the chain's steady expansion—adding about 118 stores in Guangzhou during Q1 2025 alone—the current total (as of October 2025) is likely around 2,900, based on typical quarterly growth patterns.

For context, Meiyijia operates over 40,000 stores nationwide, with more than 21,000 in Guangdong province.
