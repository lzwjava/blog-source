To ripen a green, unripe mango, follow these steps:

1. **Paper Bag Method (Closed Air)**: Place the mango in a paper bag with an apple or banana. These fruits release ethylene gas, which speeds up ripening. Fold the bag to trap the gas but allow some air exchange. Check daily; it usually takes 2-4 days. Avoid plastic bags, as they trap too much moisture and can cause rot.

2. **Room Temperature**: If you don’t have an apple or banana, keep the mango at room temperature (around 70-75°F or 21-24°C) on a counter away from direct sunlight. This takes longer, about 4-7 days.

**Air Flow vs. Closed Air**:
- **Closed air** (like the paper bag) is more effective because it traps ethylene gas, hastening ripening.
- **Air flow** (leaving it out) works but is slower since the gas disperses.

**Tips**:
- Don’t refrigerate unripe mangoes; cold slows ripening.
- Check for softness and a sweet aroma to confirm ripeness.
- If the mango has blemishes or feels too hard, it may not ripen well.

The paper bag method with an apple is your best bet for faster, reliable ripening.
