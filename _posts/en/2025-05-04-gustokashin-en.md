Mikhail Gustokashin is a prominent figure in the field of computer science education and competitive programming, particularly known for his work at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE University) in Moscow, Russia. As the Director of the Centre of Student Competitions at HSE University's Faculty of Computer Science, Gustokashin has made significant contributions to fostering algorithmic and programming talent among students and schoolchildren. His expertise lies in preparing individuals for high-level programming competitions, such as the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) and various Russian Olympiads in informatics. Below is a comprehensive introduction to his background, career, and achievements based on available information.

### Background and Education
While specific details about Mikhail Gustokashin's early life, such as his birth date or place, are not widely documented in the provided sources, his professional affiliations suggest a strong academic foundation in computer science or a related field. He is associated with HSE University, one of Russia's leading institutions, where he has been employed since 2014. His role as a methodologist and educator indicates advanced expertise in algorithms, data structures, and competitive programming methodologies. Additionally, his involvement with Yandex, a major Russian technology company, as a curator of academic programs further underscores his deep knowledge of applied computer science and pedagogy.

### Career at HSE University
Since joining HSE University in 2014, Mikhail Gustokashin has held the position of Director of the Centre of Student Competitions within the Faculty of Computer Science. In this role, he oversees initiatives to prepare students for national and international programming competitions, fostering a culture of excellence in algorithmic problem-solving. His work involves designing and delivering courses, mentoring students, and organizing competitive events that challenge participants to solve complex computational problems under time constraints.

Gustokashin teaches several courses at HSE University, focusing on foundational and advanced topics in computer science. These include:
- **Algorithms and Data Structures** (Bachelor’s program, Faculty of Computer Science, 1st year, 2nd and 4th modules)
- **Algorithms and Data Structures 2** (Bachelor’s program, Faculty of Computer Science, 2nd year, 1st module)

These courses are part of the curriculum for students in the Applied Mathematics and Informatics program, equipping them with critical skills in algorithm design, optimization, and data structure implementation. His teaching is tailored to both theoretical understanding and practical application, aligning with the demands of competitive programming.

### Contributions to Competitive Programming
Mikhail Gustokashin is a key figure in Russia’s competitive programming community, known for his success in preparing students and schoolchildren for prestigious contests. His contributions include:
- **International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC):** Gustokashin himself has competed successfully in the ICPC, notably winning a prize in the ICPC Challenge, an individual optimization problem-solving competition distinct from the traditional team-based ICPC format. In this event, held at the end of August (year not specified in the source), he demonstrated his ability to tackle complex, industry-relevant optimization problems. Additionally, he has mentored HSE University students who have excelled in ICPC, including teams that advanced to semi-finals and won regional contests.
- **Moscow Olympiad for Schoolchildren in Informatics:** As the head of the methodological committee for this Olympiad, Gustokashin plays a pivotal role in designing tasks and evaluating participants. His work ensures that the competition maintains a high standard of rigor and fairness, helping identify and nurture young talent in informatics.
- **Other Competitions:** He serves on the jury of numerous programming competitions and has prepared dozens of winners and prize-winners for the All-Russian Olympiads, a testament to his effectiveness as a mentor and educator.

### Role at Yandex and Other Affiliations
In addition to his work at HSE University, Mikhail Gustokashin is a curator of academic programs at Yandex, where he likely contributes to educational initiatives that bridge academia and industry. This role involves designing training programs, developing curricula, or mentoring students in applied computer science, aligning with Yandex’s focus on machine learning, data science, and software engineering.

He is also a methodist at the Moscow Center for Pedagogical Excellence, where he supports the development of teaching methodologies for informatics and programming. This position highlights his commitment to improving educational practices and ensuring that students receive high-quality instruction in technical subjects.

### Achievements and Recognition
Mikhail Gustokashin’s achievements extend beyond teaching and mentoring. His success in the ICPC Challenge underscores his personal prowess as a competitive programmer, capable of solving sophisticated optimization problems that lack exact algorithmic solutions. His leadership in organizing and judging competitions has earned him respect within the academic and programming communities in Russia.

Under his guidance, HSE University’s Faculty of Computer Science has achieved notable success in programming competitions. For example, students he mentored, such as Dmitry Rempel, secured prize places in the ICPC Challenge, and HSE teams have consistently performed well in regional and international rounds of the ICPC. His work has also contributed to HSE University’s reputation as a hub for computer science education and competitive programming.

### Broader Impact
Mikhail Gustokashin’s efforts have had a lasting impact on the development of computer science education in Russia. By preparing students for Olympiads and international competitions, he helps cultivate the next generation of programmers and computer scientists who contribute to both academia and industry. His involvement in events like the Binary Super Resolution Challenge (BSRC-2023), organized by HSE University’s Faculty of Computer Science and AI Centre, demonstrates his commitment to advancing research and innovation in fields like artificial intelligence and image processing.

His methodological work at the Moscow Center for Pedagogical Excellence and his curatorial role at Yandex further amplify his influence, ensuring that educational programs are rigorous, relevant, and aligned with industry needs. Through these efforts, Gustokashin bridges the gap between theoretical computer science and practical applications, preparing students for careers in technology.
