### Global Social Media Usage and Visibility

Social media platforms vary widely in user engagement, regional dominance, and accessibility due to censorship and design features. Globally, over 5.28 billion people use social networks, with activity levels (like posting and sharing) highest on dominant platforms in specific regions.[1] Below, I'll address each part of your query based on recent data, focusing on user numbers, posting habits, visibility, and restrictions.

#### Facebook: High Global Posting Activity
Yes, Facebook sees extensive posting from a massive user base. It has over 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs) as of 2025, making it the world's largest platform and used by about 37% of the global population.[2][3] Users frequently post updates, photos, videos, and status messages, with daily engagement including billions of interactions. For example, in the U.S. and many Western countries, it's a primary hub for personal sharing, news, and community groups. However, posting volume has shifted somewhat toward short-form content on apps like Instagram (also Meta-owned, with 2 billion MAUs), but Facebook remains a go-to for longer posts and events.[3] This high activity stems from its open timeline feeds, where users can view and interact with friends', family, and public pages' content easily.

#### WeChat: Intense Activity in China and Among Chinese Users
Absolutely, WeChat is a powerhouse for posting and communication, especially in China. It boasts 1.3 billion MAUs in 2025, with over 90% of users in China and daily activity including more than 45 billion messages sent.[4][5] This includes "Moments" (similar to Facebook's feed for sharing photos, status updates, and life events), group chats, and official accounts where businesses and influencers post content. Users are highly engaged: 28% fully read each post on official accounts, and 43% recall most details from them.[6] WeChat's all-in-one design (messaging, payments, mini-programs) encourages frequent use—users open it an average of 28 times daily. Outside China, it's popular among the diaspora for staying connected, but posting is more private and chat-focused compared to Facebook's public feeds.

#### Russia's Social Networks: VKontakte (VK) and Visibility
In Russia, VKontakte (commonly called VK) is the leading platform, with over 100 million active users and dominating traffic there.[7][8] It's not true that people "can't really see others"—VK functions like a hybrid of Facebook and Instagram, allowing users to view friends' posts, public groups, music, videos, and personalized feeds. However, it emphasizes privacy: users can set detailed controls (e.g., private profiles, restricted friend lists) to limit who sees their content, which is more granular than some global platforms.[9][10] For instance, younger Russians use it for sharing memes, events, and social updates, but non-friends might only see public walls or need approval to view full profiles. Odnoklassniki (OK.ru), another Russian network, is similar but geared toward older users and family connections, with comparable visibility features. Unlike fully open platforms, VK's design prioritizes connections within Russia's ecosystem, reducing casual browsing of strangers' content without mutual links. Russia also restricts some Western platforms (e.g., partial blocks on Instagram and Facebook since 2022), pushing users toward local ones like VK.[11]

#### The Great Firewall (GFW) and Platform Invisibility
The Great Firewall of China (GFW) indeed makes many global platforms "invisible" to users in mainland China without tools like VPNs. It's a sophisticated censorship system blocking access to sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (X), YouTube, WhatsApp, and Google services to control information flow.[12][13][14][15] For example, over a million websites are filtered, including most Western social media, forcing Chinese users to rely on domestic alternatives like WeChat, Weibo (similar to Twitter, with 600 million users), and Douyin (China's TikTok). This creates silos: Chinese users can't easily see or interact with Facebook or VK posts, and vice versa, unless using circumvention tools (which are risky and often detected). The GFW has expanded regionally in 2025, with rising local blocks on apps and news sites.[16] Outside China, such restrictions are rarer, but countries like Russia and Iran have similar partial firewalls.

#### TikTok and YouTube: More Global and Public Reach
Yes, TikTok and YouTube are far more international and public compared to regional giants like WeChat or VK. YouTube has 2.58 billion MAUs worldwide, drawing users from nearly every country for long-form videos, tutorials, and vlogs—its algorithm recommends content across borders, making it highly visible globally.[17] TikTok follows with 1.99 billion MAUs (including 145 million in the U.S.), focusing on short videos and viral trends that transcend regions; 60% of its audience is outside China (where it's Douyin).[18][19] Both platforms are "public by default": users from the U.S., India, Europe, and beyond can discover and engage with each other's content via global feeds, hashtags, and For You Pages, without needing personal connections. For contrast:
- **Global vs. Regional**: Asia holds 60% of social media users, but TikTok/YouTube span continents, while WeChat is 90% China-bound and VK is Russia-centric.[20]
- **Visibility Example**: A video from Brazil can trend in the U.S. on TikTok, unlike WeChat's closed Moments.

| Platform | MAUs (2025) | Primary Regions | Posting/Visibility Style | Blocked in China? |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Facebook | 3.07B | Global (esp. U.S., India) | High posting; public feeds | Yes |
| WeChat | 1.3B | China (90%) | Daily messages/posts; private groups | N/A (Domestic) |
| VK | 100M+ | Russia | Customizable profiles; friend-focused | No, but restricted elsewhere |
| TikTok | 1.99B | Global | Short videos; algorithm-driven public discovery | Partial (as Douyin) |
| YouTube | 2.58B | Global | Videos; open search/recommendations | Yes |

In summary, posting is rampant on Facebook and WeChat due to their scale, but visibility is shaped by regional preferences and barriers like the GFW—creating "echo chambers" in places like China and Russia. Global platforms like TikTok and YouTube foster cross-border exposure through algorithmic openness.[20][21]
