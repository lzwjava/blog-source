title: Fixing PyTorch and IPEX Compatibility Issues
translated: false
type: note
---

You're encountering two issues here:

1. **Version Mismatch**: Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) requires PyTorch 2.8.*, but you have PyTorch 2.7.1+cu126 (CUDA version) installed.

2. **Bug in IPEX**: There's also a bug in the IPEX library itself - it's trying to call `os.exit(127)` which doesn't exist. The correct function is `sys.exit(127)`.

Here's how to fix this:

## Solution 1: Install Compatible PyTorch Version

```bash
# Uninstall current PyTorch
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio

# Install PyTorch 2.8.* (CPU version, since you're using Intel GPU)
pip install torch==2.8.0 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Reinstall IPEX
pip install intel-extension-for-pytorch
```

## Solution 2: Upgrade to Latest Versions

```bash
# Upgrade both PyTorch and IPEX to latest compatible versions
pip install --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install --upgrade intel-extension-for-pytorch
```

## Solution 3: If You Need CUDA PyTorch

If you actually need CUDA support (for NVIDIA GPUs), then you shouldn't be using Intel Extension for PyTorch at all - they serve different hardware. Intel Extension is for Intel GPUs (Arc, Flex, Max) and CPUs with optimizations.

**Choose one:**
- **For Intel GPU/CPU**: Use PyTorch CPU build + IPEX
- **For NVIDIA GPU**: Use PyTorch CUDA build (no IPEX needed)

## Note about the Bug

The `os.exit()` bug suggests you might have an outdated version of IPEX. The latest versions should have this fixed. Make sure you're installing the most recent version after fixing the PyTorch version mismatch.

What hardware are you actually trying to use - Intel GPU, Intel CPU, or NVIDIA GPU?
