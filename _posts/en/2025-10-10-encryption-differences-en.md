### Symmetric Algorithms
Symmetric algorithms, also known as symmetric-key cryptography, use the **same secret key** for both encrypting (scrambling) data and decrypting (unscrambling) it. This makes them fast and efficient for large amounts of data, but the challenge is securely sharing the key between parties without interception.

- **Examples**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard).
- **Pros**: High speed, low computational overhead.
- **Cons**: Key distribution and management are risky.

### Non-Symmetric (Asymmetric) Algorithms
Non-symmetric algorithms, commonly called asymmetric cryptography or public-key cryptography, use a **pair of related keys**: a public key (freely shared for encryption) and a private key (kept secret for decryption). This eliminates the need to securely exchange a single key.

- **Examples**: RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).
- **Pros**: Secure key exchange, supports digital signatures and non-repudiation.
- **Cons**: Slower and more resource-intensive than symmetric methods.

### Key Differences

| Aspect              | Symmetric                          | Asymmetric (Non-Symmetric)          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Key Usage**      | One key for encrypt/decrypt       | Public key for encrypt, private for decrypt |
| **Speed**          | Faster                            | Slower                             |
| **Security**       | Depends on key secrecy            | Relies on mathematical difficulty (e.g., factoring large primes) |
| **Use Cases**      | Bulk data encryption (e.g., file storage) | Secure communication setup (e.g., HTTPS handshakes), digital certificates |

In practice, they're often combined: asymmetric for initial key exchange, symmetric for the actual data transfer (e.g., in TLS/SSL).
