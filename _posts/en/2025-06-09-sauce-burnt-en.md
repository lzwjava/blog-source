Sauces are prone to burning in an air fryer because of the appliance's **intense, direct heat** and **rapid air circulation**, which can quickly dry out or caramelize sugars and fats in the sauce. Here’s why this happens and how to prevent it:

### **Reasons Sauce Burns in an Air Fryer:**
1. **High Heat & Direct Airflow**  
   - Air fryers cook by blasting hot air directly onto food, which can cause sauces (especially those with sugar, oil, or dairy) to dry out, stick, or burn quickly.
   - Even at 180°C (356°F), sugary or thick sauces (like BBQ, teriyaki, or cheese sauces) can caramelize and scorch in just a few minutes.

2. **Lack of Moisture**  
   - Unlike an oven or stovetop, air fryers don’t retain moisture well. Sauces reduce and dry out faster, leading to burning.

3. **Thin Layers vs. Thick Layers**  
   - If the sauce is spread too thinly (e.g., brushed onto wings or chicken), it can burn before the food cooks.  
   - If it’s too thick (e.g., a glaze or cheese sauce), the outside may burn while the inside stays undercooked.

4. **Material of the Food Tray/Basket**  
   - Some air fryer baskets have non-stick coatings, but sauces can still stick and burn if left too long.

### **How to Prevent Sauce from Burning:**
✅ **Apply Sauce Late in Cooking**  
   - Cook the food first (e.g., chicken, tofu, or fries) until nearly done, then add sauce in the **last 3–5 minutes** to avoid burning.

✅ **Lower the Temperature**  
   - If using sauce for a longer time, reduce heat to **150–160°C (300–325°F)** and check frequently.

✅ **Use a Light Coat or Dilute the Sauce**  
   - Mix thick sauces with a little water, oil, or broth to help them spread evenly without burning.

✅ **Cover with Foil or a Baking Paper**  
   - If cooking saucy foods (like ribs or wings), loosely cover them with foil or parchment paper to protect the sauce from direct heat.

✅ **Stir or Flip Frequently**  
   - For even cooking, pause the air fryer halfway and flip/coat the food again to prevent sticking.

✅ **Use an Oven-Safe Dish (If Possible)**  
   - Some air fryers allow you to place a small oven-safe dish inside to hold saucy foods (like meatballs in sauce) without direct contact with the basket.

### **Best Sauces for Air Fryers (Less Likely to Burn):**
- **Light oil-based sauces** (e.g., garlic butter, pesto)  
- **Thin marinades** (e.g., soy sauce mixed with water)  
- **Acidic sauces** (e.g., lemon-based dressings)  

### **Sauces to Be Careful With:**
- **BBQ sauce** (high sugar content burns fast)  
- **Teriyaki/honey glaze** (sticky and sugary)  
- **Cheese-based sauces** (can dry out and stick)  

### **Final Tip:**  
If your recipe calls for saucing before air frying, try **pre-cooking the food first**, then adding sauce at the end for just a few minutes to set. This keeps the flavor without the burnt mess!
