A grifter is a con artist or swindler who deceives people out of money or valuables through fraud, manipulation, or false promises. They often use charm, confidence, and elaborate schemes to exploit trust, typically targeting vulnerable individuals or groups. The term is commonly associated with small-scale, opportunistic scams rather than large-scale organized crime.
