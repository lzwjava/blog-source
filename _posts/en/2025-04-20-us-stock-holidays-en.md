When considering the U.S. stock market holidays across the entire week (Monday through Friday), here’s how the holidays break down for each day:

### U.S. Stock Market Holidays (by weekday):
1. **Monday**: 
   - **New Year's Day** (if January 1st is a Monday)
   - **Martin Luther King Jr. Day** (Third Monday in January)
   - **Presidents' Day** (Third Monday in February)
   - **Memorial Day** (Last Monday in May)
   - **Labor Day** (First Monday in September)
   
   **Total holidays on Monday: 5 (or 6 if New Year's Day falls on a Monday)**

2. **Tuesday**:
   - **New Year's Day** (if January 1st is a Tuesday)
   - **Christmas Day** (if December 25th is a Tuesday)
   
   **Total holidays on Tuesday: 2**

3. **Wednesday**:
   - **No major stock market holidays** typically observed on Wednesday.

   **Total holidays on Wednesday: 0**

4. **Thursday**:
   - **Thanksgiving Day** (Fourth Thursday in November)
   
   **Total holidays on Thursday: 1**

5. **Friday**:
   - **New Year's Day** (if January 1st is a Friday)
   - **Christmas Day** (if December 25th is a Friday)
   - **Good Friday** (only sometimes, not typically a market holiday)
   
   **Total holidays on Friday: 2 (Good Friday is not always observed)**

### Summary of U.S. Stock Market Holidays by Day:
- **Monday**: 5 or 6 holidays (depending on whether New Year's Day falls on a Monday)
- **Tuesday**: 2 holidays
- **Wednesday**: 0 holidays
- **Thursday**: 1 holiday
- **Friday**: 2 holidays (Good Friday is sometimes observed)

### Conclusion:
- **Wednesday** has **the least number of holidays** observed in the U.S. stock market.
- If you want to avoid holidays altogether, **Wednesday** is the best day of the week in terms of having the least holiday impact on the market.

So, based on your original question, **Wednesday** would have the fewest U.S. stock market holidays.
