Islamic values are derived from the Quran, the Sunnah (teachings and practices of Prophet Muhammad), and Islamic tradition. They guide a Muslim’s spiritual, moral, and social life. Core values include:

- **Tawhid (Oneness of God)**: The absolute belief in one God, Allah, who is unique and indivisible (Quran 112:1-4). This underpins all aspects of faith and practice.
- **Submission (Islam)**: Surrendering to Allah’s will, reflected in daily prayers, obedience to divine commands, and striving for righteousness (Quran 2:136).
- **Iman (Faith)**: Belief in Allah, His angels, scriptures, prophets, the Day of Judgment, and divine decree (Quran 2:177). Faith drives a Muslim’s worldview.
- **Ihsan (Excellence)**: Striving to worship Allah with sincerity and excellence, as if seeing Him, knowing He sees all (Hadith: Sahih Muslim 8a).
- **Compassion and Mercy**: Emulating Allah’s attributes of mercy by showing kindness to others, especially the needy, orphans, and neighbors (Quran 4:36, 107:1-3).
- **Justice (Adl)**: Upholding fairness and equity in dealings, standing against oppression, and ensuring rights for all (Quran 4:135).
- **Brotherhood (Ummah)**: Unity and solidarity among Muslims worldwide, fostering community, mutual support, and cooperation (Quran 49:10).
- **Knowledge and Truth**: Seeking knowledge as a religious duty, valuing wisdom, and adhering to honesty (Quran 96:1-5, Hadith: Tirmidhi 2687).
- **Modesty and Humility**: Practicing humility in behavior, dress, and interactions, avoiding arrogance (Quran 31:18-19).
- **Charity (Zakat and Sadaqah)**: Obligatory giving (zakat) to purify wealth and voluntary charity (sadaqah) to help others, reflecting generosity (Quran 2:261).

These values are expressed through the Five Pillars—Shahada (faith declaration), Salah (prayer), Zakat (charity), Sawm (fasting in Ramadan), and Hajj (pilgrimage)—and vary slightly in emphasis across Sunni, Shia, and other sects. For example, Shia Muslims may place additional focus on loyalty to the Ahl al-Bayt (Prophet’s family). If you want specifics on a sect or practice, let me know!
