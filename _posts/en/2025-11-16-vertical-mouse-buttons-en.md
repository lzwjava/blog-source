Yes, vertical mice like the B.O.W M190U Pro typically include a back/forward button (often the top one on the left side for browser navigation).

Based on the design of the B.O.W M190U Pro (a wired ergonomic vertical mouse from Hangshi/B.O.W, similar to their MD190 series), the two top buttons on the left side are the programmable thumb buttons. The top one functions as the **back** button by default (e.g., for going back in web browsers or apps), and the one below it functions as the **forward** button. These can often be remapped via Windows/macOS settings or third-party software if needed.

The right side handles the primary left-click (index finger) and right-click (middle finger), just like a traditional mouse, while the scroll wheel sits between them for easy thumb access.
