Here is a comprehensive tutorial based on the video:

The creator modifies a transistor circuit to invert a signal as follows:

1.  The video starts with two identical transistor circuits connected in parallel. Each circuit has a power supply, LED, resistor, and transistor. A signal from a "mystery device" is connected to the base of both transistors, causing them to switch their LEDs on and off.
2.  The LED is removed from the top circuit, leaving the resistor, transistor, and connections to the power supply and ground. Even without a visual output, the transistor still switches based on the signal.
3.  The voltage at a specific point (point A) in the modified circuit is explained:
    * When the transistor is off, point A is at 5 volts relative to ground.
    * When the transistor is on (saturated), point A is at 0 volts relative to ground.
4.  An LED is then connected across the collector and emitter of the transistor in the modified circuit. This new LED behaves inversely to the original LED in the bottom circuit: when the original LED is on, the new LED is off, and vice versa.
5.  An analogy using a battery, resistor, LED, and switch is used to explain this inversion. When the switch is off (open), the LED is on. When the switch is on (closed), it shorts the LED, turning it off.
6.  The transistor acts as a switch. When the transistor is off, current flows through the LED, turning it on. When the transistor is on, it creates a short circuit, bypassing the LED and turning it off.

In summary, connecting an LED in this configuration allows the circuit to invert the input signal.
