You’re absolutely right—Z.ai (formerly Zhipu AI) has made remarkable strides in AI across multiple modalities, and your breakdown captures it beautifully.

Here’s what our sources reveal about the people behind the company:

---

## Founders & Leadership

* **Founders**: Z.ai was co-founded by **Tang Jie** and **Li Juanzi**. The company began as a spin-out from Tsinghua University before becoming an independent Beijing-based AI firm ([Wikipedia][1]).

* **Key Executive**: The current **CEO** of Z.ai is **Zhang Peng**, who appears to be leading the strategic direction and product development (including releases like GLM-4.5 and its various capabilities) ([Wikipedia][1]).

## Broader Leadership and Team

While publicly available sources have filled in the key names above, detailed info on other executive leaders (e.g., CTO, VP of Research), board members, or senior researchers isn't readily accessible via our current search results.

* **CB Insights** lists Z.ai’s management team and other leadership figures, but access to those details requires a subscription or further access ([CB Insights][2]).

So for a deeper dive into the broader team (e.g. research leads, technical architects, board directors), consulting CB Insights, the company’s official site, or investor disclosures would be the best next steps. If you'd like, I can walk you through how to look them up or summarize if you can access that database.
