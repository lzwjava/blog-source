title: Monitoring Directory Changes with the FSEvents API
translated: false

I was using a Jekyll blog, and when I ran `bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental`, the terminal displayed `fsevent_watch`. Consequently, I inquired about it with an AI.

It seems like you might be referring to `fsevent_watch`, which isn’t a standard, standalone tool or function in most programming contexts. Based on your question and common conventions, I’ll assume you’re asking about working with the **FSEvents API** on macOS to monitor file system events—perhaps you meant something like `fsevents` or a related utility. If I’ve misunderstood, please clarify!

The FSEvents API is a macOS-specific framework that allows applications to receive notifications about changes in a directory tree. It’s commonly used in C, Objective-C, or Swift programming to watch for file system events like file creation, deletion, or modification. Since `fsevent_watch` isn’t a recognized command or function (it might be a typo or a third-party tool), I’ll explain how to use the FSEvents API directly, which is likely what you’re after.

Here’s a practical guide to using FSEvents to monitor a directory:

### Using FSEvents in C/Objective-C
The FSEvents API is part of the CoreServices framework on macOS. Below is a basic example in C to monitor a directory for changes:

1. **Include Necessary Headers**:
   You’ll need to include the FSEvents header from the CoreServices framework.

2. **Set Up the Event Stream**:
   Create an event stream to watch a specific directory, define a callback function to handle events, and schedule it with a run loop.

3. **Handle Events**:
   The callback processes the events (e.g., file changed, deleted) and provides paths and flags.

Here’s a minimal example:

```c
#include <CoreServices/CoreServices.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Callback function to handle file system events
void callback(
    ConstFSEventStreamRef streamRef,
    void *clientCallBackInfo,
    size_t numEvents,
    void *eventPaths,
    const FSEventStreamEventFlags eventFlags[],
    const FSEventStreamEventId eventIds[])
{
    char **paths = (char **)eventPaths;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < numEvents; i++) {
        printf("Change detected at: %s (Flags: 0x%x)\n", paths[i], eventFlags[i]);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Path to monitor (e.g., your home directory)
    CFStringRef myPath = CFStringCreateWithCString(NULL, "/Users/yourusername", kCFStringEncodingUTF8);
    CFArrayRef pathsToWatch = CFArrayCreate(NULL, (const void **)&myPath, 1, NULL);

    // Create the event stream
    FSEventStreamRef stream = FSEventStreamCreate(
        NULL,           // Allocator
        &callback,      // Callback function
        NULL,           // Callback info (context)
        pathsToWatch,   // Paths to watch
        kFSEventStreamEventIdSinceNow, // Start with events from now
        1.0,            // Latency in seconds (batching delay)
        kFSEventStreamCreateFlagNone // Flags (can use kFSEventStreamCreateFlagFileEvents for file-level events)
    );

    // Schedule the stream on the current run loop
    FSEventStreamScheduleWithRunLoop(stream, CFRunLoopGetCurrent(), kCFRunLoopDefaultMode);

    // Start the stream
    FSEventStreamStart(stream);

    // Run the loop to listen for events
    printf("Monitoring /Users/yourusername... Press Ctrl+C to stop.\n");
    CFRunLoopRun();

    // Cleanup (unreachable in this example unless stopped)
    FSEventStreamStop(stream);
    FSEventStreamInvalidate(stream);
    FSEventStreamRelease(stream);
    CFRelease(pathsToWatch);
    CFRelease(myPath);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Steps Explained:
- **Paths to Watch**: You specify one or more directories (e.g., `/Users/yourusername`) in a `CFArray`.
- **Callback**: The `callback` function is triggered when changes occur. It receives an array of affected paths and flags (e.g., `kFSEventStreamEventFlagItemCreated`).
- **Stream Creation**: `FSEventStreamCreate` sets up the watcher. The latency (e.g., `1.0` seconds) batches events to avoid overwhelming the callback.
- **Run Loop**: The stream integrates with a run loop (like `CFRunLoopRun`) to keep the program alive and responsive.
- **Cleanup**: Stop and release the stream when done (not shown in this infinite loop example).

#### Compilation:
Compile with the CoreServices framework:
```bash
gcc -o fsevents_example fsevents_example.c -framework CoreServices
```

Run it:
```bash
./fsevents_example
```

### Key Points:
- **Granularity**: By default, FSEvents monitors directory-level changes. For file-level events (e.g., specific file modifications), add the `kFSEventStreamCreateFlagFileEvents` flag.
- **Latency**: The latency parameter (e.g., `1.0`) controls how often the callback fires. Lower values give faster updates but more calls.
- **Scope**: FSEvents watches the entire directory tree recursively—no need to specify subdirectories.

### Alternative: Using a Tool
If you’re looking for a command-line tool rather than coding it yourself, there’s no `fsevent_watch` in the standard macOS toolkit. However, third-party tools like `fswatch` leverage FSEvents. To use `fswatch`:

1. **Install fswatch** (e.g., via Homebrew):
   ```bash
   brew install fswatch
   ```

2. **Run it**:
   ```bash
   fswatch /path/to/watch
   ```
   This outputs paths as changes occur. For example:
   ```bash
   fswatch ~/Documents
   ```
   You’ll see lines like `/Users/yourusername/Documents/file.txt` when files change.

3. **With a Script**:
   Pipe it to a script for custom actions:
   ```bash
   fswatch ~/Documents | while read -r file; do echo "Changed: $file"; done
   ```

### If You Meant Something Else
If `fsevent_watch` refers to a specific library, tool, or typo (e.g., `fsevents-watch`), please provide more context—like the programming language or environment you’re working in—and I’ll tailor the response further.

Let me know how I can refine this for you!
