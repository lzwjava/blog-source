title: Hong Kong Banks Support FPS Transfers

Yes, all licensed banks in Hong Kong are required to participate in the Faster Payment System (FPS), so they support transfers using proxy identifiers like FPS ID, email, or phone number. This means you can send or receive funds across banks in real-time (or near real-time) via these methods, though the exact speed and features (e.g., instant crediting) can depend on the specific bank's implementation. E-wallet operators (SVFs) are also connected and support it.
