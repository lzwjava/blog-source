title: GPG Encryption Time for Large Files

The file you're encrypting appears to be a YIFY release of *The Matrix* (1999) in 720p, which is typically around 700 MB in size.

GPG encryption time for a file this size varies based on your hardware (CPU speed, disk I/O), whether the file is compressible (videos like MP4 generally aren't, so default compression adds little benefit and may slightly slow things down), and system load. On typical modern hardware:

- Expect 30–60 seconds for the full process.
- If it's feeling slower (e.g., minutes instead), it could be due to slow disk reads/writes, background processes, or an older machine—try adding `--compress-algo none` to the command to skip compression and speed it up for already-compressed files like this one.

For even faster results on large files, consider symmetric encryption with a passphrase (`gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256`) if you don't need recipient-specific asymmetric keys.
