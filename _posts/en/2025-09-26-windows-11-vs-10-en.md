### Overview
Windows 11 (initial release, unveiled June 24, 2021; general availability October 5, 2021) is the successor to Windows 10 (released July 29, 2015; last updated significantly in October 2021 with Windows 10 21H2). Both are operating systems from Microsoft, but Windows 11 represents a major visual and functional overhaul aimed at modern users, while Windows 10 focused on unification across devices. Windows 11 is free to upgrade from Windows 10 on compatible hardware, but requires stricter system requirements. This comparison focuses on the initial release of Windows 11 versus the cumulative state of Windows 10 up to that point.

### System Requirements
Windows 11 enforces higher minimum specs for better security and performance, limiting its compatibility compared to Windows 10's broader support.

- **CPU**: Windows 11 requires a 64-bit processor with at least 1 GHz speed and 2 or more cores (e.g., Intel 8th-gen or AMD Ryzen 2000 series and newer). Windows 10 supports older 64-bit CPUs from as far back as 2006 (e.g., Pentium 4 or Athlon 64).
- **RAM**: Windows 11 requires at least 4 GB; Windows 10 works with 2 GB.
- **Storage**: Windows 11 needs 64 GB free space; Windows 10 requires only 20 GB.
- **Graphics**: Windows 11 mandates DirectX 12 compatible graphics with a WDDM 2.0 driver. Windows 10 supports older DirectX versions.
- **Security**: Windows 11 requires TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) for hardware-based security; Windows 10 supports TPM but doesn't mandate it.
- **Display**: Windows 11 needs at least 720p HD resolution (9" diagonal); Windows 10 supports down to 800x600.
- **Other**: Windows 11 requires an active internet connection and Microsoft account for setup. Windows 10 supports offline installations more easily.

Windows 10 can run on a wider range of devices, including older PCs and tablets, making it more accessible for legacy hardware.

### User Interface and Design
Windows 11 introduces a refreshed, modern aesthetic inspired by Windows 10X concepts, emphasizing fluidity and touch-friendliness, while Windows 10 retains a more traditional desktop-centric look.

- **Start Menu**: Windows 11 features a centered Start button with a new menu that includes pinned apps, recommended files, and live tiles in a grid. Windows 10 has a left-aligned Start menu with a list view and customizable tiles.
- **Taskbar**: Windows 11 centers the taskbar by default, hides unused icons in an overflow area, and integrates a unified search box. Windows 10's taskbar is left-aligned by default and shows all icons.
- **Windows and Apps**: Windows 11 has rounded corners, snap layouts (for multitasking with up to 4 windows), and new animations. Windows 10 uses sharp corners and the Action Center for notifications; it lacks Windows 11's virtual desktops refinements.
- **Themes and Customization**: Windows 11 adds auto-dark mode options, accent color controls, and wallpaper personalization. Windows 10 supports themes via the Microsoft Store and Settings.
- **Accessibility**: Both support similar features (e.g., Narrator, Magnifier), but Windows 11 enhances touch/pen input and voice typing integration.

### Features and Functionality
Windows 11 builds on Windows 10's foundation with new productivity tools, while dropping or de-emphasizing some older Windows 10 elements like Cortana.

- **Productivity**: Windows 11 introduces widgets (personalizable timeline of news, weather, etc.) on the left of the desktop, improved multitasking with FancyZones-like snap layouts, and Teams integration in the taskbar. Windows 10 relies on Timeline (later phased out) and basic snapping.
- **Apps and Integration**: Windows 11 supports Android apps via the Amazon Appstore and has a redesigned Microsoft Store with Win32 app support and auto-updates. Windows 10's Store was more limited to UWP apps; Cortana is central, though fading.
- **Gaming**: Windows 11 includes Xbox Game Bar v2.0 with HDR calibration, DirectStorage for faster SSD loading, and Auto HDR for older games. Windows 10 has Xbox integrations but lacks these auto-HDR/variable refresh rate advancements.
- **Browsing and Search**: Windows 11 integrates Bing AI/Chat (via Edge) more deeply; both use Edge as default, but Windows 11 emphasizes Chromium-based Edge features.
- **Virtualization**: Windows 11 adds WSL 2 performance tweaks and improved Hyper-V. Windows 10 introduced WSL but requires add-ons for advanced uses.
- **Removed/Deprecated Features**: Windows 11 drops Internet Explorer, Live Tiles customization, and some legacy apps. Windows 10 retains broader backward compatibility.

### Security and Privacy
Windows 11 emphasizes modern hardware-based security, building on Windows 10's foundations but requiring stricter prerequisites.

- **Hardware Security**: TPM 2.0 is mandatory for Windows 11, enabling secure boot and BitLocker enhancements. Windows 10 supports TPM but allows bypasses on non-TPM devices.
- **App Security**: Windows 11 uses SmartScreen and Microsoft Defender with expanded threat detection; it isolates apps in containers. Windows 10 has similar but less integrated protections.
- **Updates**: Windows 11 rolls out updates faster with fewer reboots and rollback options. Windows 10 often had more disruptive update cycles, though both support feature updates.
- **Privacy**: Both include controls over data collection, but Windows 11 adds focus assist improvements and diagnostic data toggles.

### Performance and Stability
Windows 11 is optimized for newer hardware with better efficiency, but Windows 10 remains more flexible on older systems.

- **Boot and Responsiveness**: Windows 11 boots faster on compatible hardware (e.g., due to SSD optimizations) and has reduced memory usage. Windows 10 is mire efficient on low-spec devices.
- **Resource Management**: Windows 11 improves power management for laptops (e.g., better battery life) and supports HDR displays natively. Windows 10 excels in high-performance scenarios like gaming on older GPUs.
- **Stability**: Initial Windows 11 builds had bugs (e.g., taskbar crashes), but mirrors Windows 10's stability overall; Windows 10 has seen over 6 years of refinements.
- **Compatibility**: Windows 10 runs nearly all software; Windows 11 drops 32-bit app support and some legacy drivers.

### Ecosystem and Support
Windows 11 aims for a unified Microsoft ecosystem, while Windows 10 supports a wider range of devices.

- **Device Support**: Windows 11 prioritizes modern PCs, tablets, and Xbox; Windows 10 runs on smartphones (discontinued), IoT, and embedded systems.
- **Lifecycle**: Windows 10 support ends October 14, 2025. Windows 11's initial release has ongoing updates.
- **Upgrading**: Free for Windows 10 users on eligible hardware via update; otherwise, clean installs required.

Windows 11 is ideal for users seeking a fresh, streamlined experience with modern security, while Windows 10 suits those with older hardware or preferring familiarity. If upgrading, check compatibility via Microsoft's PC Health Check app. For the latest features, Windows 11 has evolved since its initial release (e.g., 2023+ sunsets).
