Yes, you can add lemon slices to Guangdong-style (Cantonese) chicken soup, but it’s not traditional — and most Cantonese cooks would say it’s a bit “heretical” 😅.

Classic Guangdong clear chicken soup (清燉雞湯 / 白切雞湯底) aims for a very clean, pure expression of chicken flavor, usually seasoned only with ginger, sometimes a little scallion, goji berries, and salt. The taste is sweet, delicate, and umami-rich from long-simmered old hen. Lemon is very rarely used because:

- Lemon’s acidity and citrus aroma can overpower or clash with the subtle chicken sweetness that Cantonese people prize.
- Traditional Cantonese palates generally avoid sour notes in clear chicken soup (sour flavors appear more in things like sweet-and-sour dishes or hot-and-sour soup from other regions).

That said, many modern home cooks (especially younger ones or overseas Cantonese) do experiment and like adding a few thin lemon slices (or even lime) toward the end or as a garnish for a bright, refreshing twist — it turns the soup into something closer to a lemony chicken broth that feels lighter and more appetizing in hot weather.

If you want to try it without completely abandoning the Guangdong spirit, here are two safe ways:

1. Minimalist approach (still feels Cantonese)  
   - Simmer the chicken soup the normal way (old hen, ginger, water, maybe some dried scallop or conch).  
   - Right before serving, float 1–2 very thin, unpeeled lemon slices in each bowl for 30–60 seconds only (or just squeeze a tiny bit of juice in). Remove the slices before eating. This gives a faint citrus perfume without killing the original flavor.

2. Fusion / “improved” version people actually like in Taiwan and Hong Kong nowadays  
   - Add 3–4 thin lemon slices (with peel) in the last 5–10 minutes of simmering.  
   - Optionally throw in some fresh coriander or a dash of white pepper.  
   - It becomes a bright, aromatic lemon–chicken soup that’s very drinkable, especially in summer.

So: traditional purists will say no. Practical eaters (and most people under 40 in Guangdong/Taiwan/HK these days) will say go ahead, it’s delicious.

Your soup, your rules! 🍋🐓
