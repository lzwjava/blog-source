- Communicates only through screenshots, using phrases like *"why not ok?"* or *"has question"*—extremely basic English.  

- Asks for your help in meetings, but then does most of the talking and doesn’t listen carefully to your input.  

- Has a rigid mindset and struggles with critical thinking.  

- Takes months to complete small tasks, always making excuses.  

- Blames the system for being "too complex" or "too large" instead of adapting.  

- Lacks emotional control, frequently arguing with colleagues in the office.  

- Creates distrust through arrogant behavior.  

- Acts overly strict with others, despite not being a lead or manager.  

- Even in an international company, insists on typing in Chinese (e.g., in Teams chats).  

- Comes from a once-prestigious big company that has declined in recent years—relying on past success rather than innovation. Such employees coast on their degrees and reputation, mirroring their company's reliance on brand over quality.

- Poorly skilled engineers often remain employed at a large company for many years for two main reasons: first, their inability to transition to new jobs easily, and second, they tend to stay until a company branch shuts down due to employer tolerance.

- Worries about performance, yet resorts to cheating or cutting corners instead of improving.  

- A bad engineer isn’t just costly in terms of salary—they waste time and force capable engineers to clean up their mess.  

- Impatient to demonstrate that they are okay, they claim to know how to change things here and there, but in reality, they lack deep understanding.

- They work for an international company but still use Baidu to search for information.

- Because their English is poor, they can’t even communicate about simple topics in English.

- They are afraid and nervous because they used dishonest methods—such as falsifying work experience on their resume or memorizing interview questions provided by recruiters—to luckily secure the job. Now, they live in constant fear of being exposed, which is why they rarely smile or laugh.

- Bad engineers often reveal themselves in their mid-30s or 40s. They spend most of their career playing games, doing just one hour of real work—or even less—when needed in a working day.

- They are tempted to remain quiet because there isn't much progress to report, and they don't want it to be found out.

- I don't inherently hate bad engineers. You can do whatever you want as long as you don't hurt others. From others' points of view, and early in my career, other senior engineers might have regarded me as a bad engineer too. What I can't tolerate is lying or deceiving. This is bad.
