title: Affordable English Practice with Native Speakers

Recently, I tried an English language conversation practice session with a native speaker from Pinduoduo.com.

The assistant will add your WeChat via your mobile phone number and help you arrange the course.

It's cheap, at only 18 CNY per course for about 25 minutes. The teachers are from the Phillipines. By the way, I just learned the word "Phillipinos" from this chat.

I saw this course advertised by X. The price is really cheap, so I wanted to try it. Although my IELTS score was 6 two years ago, I want to achieve 7.5 this year, so I need to practice my English more, especially speaking and writing.

We talked about some IELTS speaking exercises. The English teacher asked me exam questions about topics like travel, photo-taking habits, and traffic jams.

Another famous platform, VIPKID, charged 150 CNY per course for 25 minutes years ago.

So, the price is really cheap here now.

I searched for Japanese conversation practice on Pinduoduo.com. Unfortunately, there are no merchants offering such a service at the moment.

I would like to take more English courses.
