It seems like you're asking about how to use the `hls.js` library, specifically version `^0.7.6`, which is a JavaScript library for playing HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) video streams in browsers. I'll provide a concise guide on how to set it up and use it based on general knowledge of the library. Note that version `0.7.6` is quite old (released around 2017), so some features or APIs might differ from the latest versions. If you need specifics tied to that exact version, let me know, and I can refine the answer further!

### Steps to Use `hls.js` (v0.7.6)

#### 1. **Install or Include the Library**
You can include `hls.js` in your project in one of these ways:

- **Via npm** (if you're using a build tool like Webpack):
  ```bash
  npm install hls.js@^0.7.6
  ```
  Then import it in your JavaScript:
  ```javascript
  var Hls = require('hls.js');
  ```

- **Via CDN** (if you're adding it directly to an HTML file):
  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@0.7.6"></script>
  ```
  This makes `Hls` available as a global variable.

#### 2. **Set Up Your HTML**
You need a `<video>` element in your HTML to attach the HLS stream to:
```html
<video id="video" controls></video>
```

#### 3. **Initialize `hls.js`**
Here’s a basic example of how to use `hls.js` to load and play an HLS stream (e.g., an `.m3u8` file):

```javascript
// Check if the browser supports HLS natively (e.g., Safari)
// If not, use hls.js
var video = document.getElementById('video');
var videoSrc = 'https://example.com/playlist.m3u8'; // Replace with your HLS URL

if (Hls.isSupported()) {
    var hls = new Hls();
    hls.loadSource(videoSrc);
    hls.attachMedia(video);
    hls.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, function () {
        video.play();
    });
} else if (video.canPlayType('application/vnd.apple.mpegurl')) {
    // For browsers with native HLS support (e.g., Safari)
    video.src = videoSrc;
    video.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', function () {
        video.play();
    });
}
```

#### 4. **Key Concepts**
- **`Hls.isSupported()`**: Checks if the browser needs `hls.js` (returns `true` if Media Source Extensions are supported).
- **`loadSource(url)`**: Loads the HLS manifest (`.m3u8` file).
- **`attachMedia(video)`**: Attaches the video element to the `hls.js` instance.
- **`Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED`**: Event fired when the manifest is loaded, indicating the stream is ready to play.

#### 5. **Example with Error Handling**
To make it more robust:
```javascript
var video = document.getElementById('video');
var videoSrc = 'https://example.com/playlist.m3u8';

if (Hls.isSupported()) {
    var hls = new Hls();
    hls.loadSource(videoSrc);
    hls.attachMedia(video);
    hls.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, function () {
        video.play();
    });
    hls.on(Hls.Events.ERROR, function (event, data) {
        console.error('HLS Error:', data);
        if (data.fatal) {
            switch (data.type) {
                case Hls.ErrorTypes.NETWORK_ERROR:
                    console.log('Network error, retrying...');
                    hls.startLoad();
                    break;
                case Hls.ErrorTypes.MEDIA_ERROR:
                    console.log('Media error, recovering...');
                    hls.recoverMediaError();
                    break;
                default:
                    hls.destroy();
                    break;
            }
        }
    });
} else if (video.canPlayType('application/vnd.apple.mpegurl')) {
    video.src = videoSrc;
}
```

#### Notes for Version `^0.7.6`
- This version is from 2017, so it lacks newer features like adaptive bitrate switching improvements or low-latency HLS support added in later versions.
- The core API (`loadSource`, `attachMedia`, events like `MANIFEST_PARSED`) should work as shown above.
- Check the [official `hls.js` GitHub releases](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/releases/tag/v0.7.6) for the exact changelog if you need precise details.

#### 6. **Testing**
- Use a publicly available HLS stream for testing, like:
  ```
  https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8
  ```
- Open your browser’s developer tools (F12) to debug any issues.
