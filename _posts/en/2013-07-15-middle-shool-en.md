I entered Yuyan Middle School in Huangpu District. Originally, Yuyan Middle School belonged to Luogang District, which was merged into Huangpu District in February 2014, around one year after I graduated from middle school.

I studied there for six years, which is the longest time I have stayed with any organization in my life. I attended two primary schools, spending 3 years at each. In my corporate career, the longest tenure I had was at my startup, which lasted 3.5 years.

One reason I stayed there was that I had a good ego and a good life there. I scored 286.5 out of 300 on the junior middle school entrance exam, ranking around the top 10 in Luogang District. I left junior middle school ranked number 4 to join high school, although it was the same school campus, just a different building.

In high school, my performance wasn't as good, but it was still decent. I ranked around 40th among 320 students when graduating and went on to attend Beijing Forestry University, a 211 school. With three years of programming study, I once made it to a contest in Guangdong Province, though I didn't win an award like the third prize. However, only about 350 students in Guangdong could make it to the second round in NOIP (National Olympiad in Informatics in the Province). So I guess my achievement ranked around 300th.
