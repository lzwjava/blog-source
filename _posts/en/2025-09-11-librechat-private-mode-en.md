Ah, that makes sense! If you’re using **Private Chat** mode in LibreChat, then the “empty sidebar” behavior is expected, not an error.  

Here’s why:
- **Private Chat mode** is specifically designed to **not save any conversation history** in the database. Each time you open/reload the app in Private mode, it will start fresh with no past messages shown in the sidebar.  
- Any chats you have in this mode are only stored **in memory for that browser tab/session**, and once you refresh, navigate away, or close the browser, they disappear.
- That’s different from normal (non‑private) chats, where conversations are saved and indexed, then displayed in the sidebar.

✅ If you want permanent history, you’ll need to start a non‑private chat.  
🕵️ If you prefer sessions not to persist for privacy, then Private chat is behaving as intended.

Would you like me to outline **how to switch between Private Chat and regular chat** in LibreChat so your sidebar always remembers conversations when you want it to?
