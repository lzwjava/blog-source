I am a Chinese citizen and a software engineer focused on the latest technology. It's frustrating to see many products banning access from China. Although I’m still working on my associate degree and hope to work outside China someday, I will remain in China for a few more years. In the meantime, I'd like to share some information about overcoming internet barriers based on nationality.

## Email

Having multiple email accounts is better. Claude banned my Gmail due to VPN access, so I registered a new Outlook email and it worked fine.

## Phone Number

Through [http://sms-activate.org](http://sms-activate.org), it's possible to rent a phone number for registration. However, the issue is that accounts registered with such phone numbers may have some risks.

In China, I personally recommend [https://www.1888.com.mo](https://www.1888.com.mo) for a China Telecom Macau card. I’ve also tried the Giffgaff UK SIM card and recently ordered a PayGo T-Mobile USA SIM card.

## Apple Store Region

To switch the App Store to the USA region, turn on a global proxy (USA), and it will display the "None" payment option, allowing you to switch freely.  

You can use a Visa card to buy gift cards from Amazon or use the Apple gift card portal to fund your App Store account.

The same method applies to Singapore or other regions.

## Payment

Having a Visa card is convenient. However, Visa cards issued by China still have some restrictions. For example, Anthropic or OpenAI do not accept Chinese-issued Visa cards.

## VPN

You may want to check out [Proxy Solutions in China](./proxy-en) and [Set Up Your Proxy Server](./diy-proxy-en).

## Identity 

I have a Chinese citizen identity card and passport, which can be helpful in certain situations.
