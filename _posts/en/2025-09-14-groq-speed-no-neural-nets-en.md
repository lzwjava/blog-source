title: GROQ Speed Explained Without Neural Networks
translated: false
type: note

## Short answer  

**No – GROQ itself does not run a transformer‑style neural network (no “K‑Q‑V” attention, no tensor‑matrix math, no GPT‑style inference).**  
Its speed comes from classic database‑engine tricks (column‑store layout, index‑driven filtering, compiled query plans, streaming execution, parallel workers, and aggressive caching).  

If a Sanity project *does* use a transformer‑based service (e.g., embeddings for semantic search, OpenAI‑style completions, or a custom “AI‑field”), that part of the pipeline is **separate** from the GROQ engine and will have the latency characteristics of any other ML inference service. The two can be combined, but the “instant” feel you get when you run a plain GROQ query is **not** because a transformer is doing the heavy lifting.

Below is a deeper dive that explains:

1. **What GROQ actually is and why it’s fast** (a recap of the previous answer, trimmed to the essentials).  
2. **Why transformer inference is a different beast** and why it’s generally slower than a pure index‑driven query.  
3. **When and how you *might* see transformers in a Sanity workflow**, and what tricks providers use to make that part faster.  
4. **A quick comparison table** showing the typical latency trade‑offs between pure‑GROQ queries, transformer‑based semantic search, and “hybrid” approaches.

## 1. GROQ = Compiled, Column‑Store Query Language (no neural nets)

| Component | What it does | Why it’s fast (vs. a model) |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| **Content Lake** (binary‑packed, column‑oriented store) | Stores each field in its own sorted, compressed column. | A filter can be satisfied by scanning a single tiny column; no need to deserialize whole JSON objects. |
| **Query compilation** | Parses the GROQ string once, builds an AST, creates a reusable execution plan. | The expensive parsing work is done only once; later calls just reuse the plan. |
| **Push‑down filtering & projection** | Evaluates predicates while reading the column, and only pulls the columns you ask for. | I/O is minimized; the engine never touches data that won’t appear in the result. |
| **Streaming pipeline** | Source → filter → map → slice → serializer → HTTP response. | First rows reach the client as soon as they’re ready, giving an “instant” perception. |
| **Parallel, server‑less workers** | Query is split across many shards and run on many CPU cores simultaneously. | Large result sets finish in ≈ tens of ms instead of seconds. |
| **Caching layers** (plan cache, edge CDN, fragment cache) | Stores compiled plans and often‑used result fragments. | Subsequent identical queries skip almost all work. |

All of these are **deterministic, integer‑oriented operations** that run on a CPU (or sometimes SIMD‑accelerated code). There is **no matrix multiplication, back‑propagation, or floating‑point heavy lifting** involved.

## 2. Transformer inference – why it’s slower (by design)

| Step in a typical transformer‑based service | Typical cost | Reason it’s slower than a pure index scan |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Tokenisation** (text → token IDs) | ~0.1 ms per 100 bytes | Still cheap, but adds overhead. |
| **Embedding lookup / generation** (matrix‑multiply) | 0.3 – 2 ms per token on a CPU; < 0.2 ms on a GPU/TPU | Requires floating‑point linear algebra on large weight matrices (often 12 – 96 layers). |
| **Self‑attention (K‑Q‑V) for each layer** | O(N²) per token‑sequence length (N) → ~1 – 5 ms for short sentences on a GPU; much more for longer sequences. | Quadratic scaling makes long inputs expensive. |
| **Feed‑forward network + layer‑norm** | Additional ~0.5 ms per layer | More floating‑point ops. |
| **Decoding (if generating text)** | 20 – 100 ms per token on a GPU; often > 200 ms on a CPU. | Autoregressive generation is inherently sequential. |
| **Network latency (cloud endpoint)** | 5 – 30 ms round‑trip (depending on provider) | Adds to the total latency. |

Even a **highly‑optimised, quantised** transformer (e.g., 8‑bit or 4‑bit) running on a modern GPU typically takes **tens of milliseconds** for a single embedding request, **plus network hop time**. That is *orders of magnitude* slower than a pure index scan that can be satisfied in a few milliseconds on the same hardware.

### Bottom‑line physics

* **Index look‑ups** → O(1)–O(log N) reads of a few kilobytes → < 5 ms on a typical CPU.  
* **Transformer inference** → O(L · D²) floating‑point ops (L = layers, D = hidden size) → 10‑100 ms on a GPU, > 100 ms on a CPU.

So when you see a **“GROQ is fast”** claim, it is *not* because Sanity has somehow replaced the mathematics of attention with a secret shortcut; it is because the problem they are solving (filtering and projecting structured content) is *much better suited* to classic database techniques.

## 3. When you *do* use transformers with Sanity – the “hybrid” pattern

Sanity is a **headless CMS**, not a machine‑learning platform. However, the ecosystem encourages a few common ways to sprinkle AI into a content workflow:

| Use‑case | How it is typically wired up | Where the latency comes from |
|----------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Semantic search** (e.g., “find articles about *react hooks*”) | 1️⃣ Export candidate documents → 2️⃣ Generate embeddings (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) → 3️⃣ Store embeddings in a vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.) → 4️⃣ At query time: embed the query → 5️⃣ Vector similarity search → 6️⃣ Use the resulting IDs in a **GROQ** filter (`*_id in $ids`). | The heavy part is steps 2‑5 (embedding generation + vector similarity). Once you have the IDs, step 6 is a regular GROQ call and is *instant*. |
| **Content‑generation assistants** (auto‑fill a field, draft copy) | Front‑end sends a prompt to an LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic) → receives generated text → writes back to Sanity via its API. | The LLM inference latency dominates (usually 200 ms‑2 s). The subsequent write is a normal GROQ‑driven mutation (fast). |
| **Auto‑tagging / classification** | A webhook triggers on document create → serverless function calls a classifier model → writes back tags. | The classifier inference time (often a tiny transformer) is the bottleneck; the write path is fast. |
| **Image‑to‑text (alt‑text generation)** | Same pattern as above, but the model processes image bytes. | Image preprocessing + model inference dominates latency. |

**Key point:** *All* of the AI‑heavy steps are **outside** the GROQ engine. Once you have the AI‑derived data (IDs, tags, generated text), you go back to GROQ for the fast, index‑driven part.

### How providers make the AI‑part “faster”

If you do need that AI step to be low‑latency, providers use a mix of engineering tricks:

| Trick | Effect on latency |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Model quantisation (int8/4‑bit)** | Reduces FLOPs → 2‑5× speed‑up on the same hardware. |
| **GPU/TPU serving with batch‑size = 1 optimisation** | Removes batch‑norm overhead; keeps GPU warm. |
| **Compiled kernels (TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, XLA)** | Eliminates Python‑level overhead, fuses ops. |
| **Edge inference (e.g., Cloudflare Workers‑AI, Cloudflare AI Compute)** | Cuts network round‑trip to < 5 ms for small models. |
| **Cache of recent embeddings** | If many queries repeat the same text, you can serve the embedding from a fast key‑value store (Redis, Cloudflare KV). |
| **Hybrid “approximate nearest neighbour” (ANN) indices** | Vector DBs like Qdrant or Pinecone use HNSW/IVF‑PQ that answer similarity queries in < 1 ms for millions of vectors. |

Even with those tricks, **the AI step is still an order of magnitude slower** than the pure GROQ index lookup. That’s why a typical “semantic search + GROQ” flow looks like:

```
client ──► embed query (≈30 ms) ──► vector DB similarity (≈5 ms)
          │
          └─► receive list of IDs ──► GROQ filter (≈2 ms) ──► final results
```

Overall ≈ 40 ms – fast enough for many UI experiences, but **the bottleneck is clearly the embedding step**, not the GROQ engine.

## 4. Quick latency comparison (illustrative numbers)

| Scenario | Typical latency (median) | What dominates |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Pure GROQ filter & projection** (`*[_type=="post" && publishedAt < now()]{title,slug}`) | 10‑30 ms (cold), 5‑12 ms (warm) | Column reads + plan cache |
| **GROQ + vector‑search (semantic)** (`*[_id in $ids]{title,slug}` after embedding) | 35‑60 ms total | Embedding generation + vector DB lookup |
| **Full‑text search using an external LLM** (`openai embeddings → vector DB → GROQ`) | 80‑150 ms | LLM inference + network hop |
| **GraphQL resolver that fetches each post from a relational DB** | 120‑300 ms (often N+1) | Multiple round‑trips to DB, no column store |
| **Elasticsearch query with aggregations** | 50‑120 ms (depends on shard count) | Lucene scoring + network aggregation |

*Numbers are ball‑park and vary by dataset size, hardware, and caching.*

## 5. TL;DR for your exact question

- **GROQ does not use transformers, K‑Q‑V attention, or any tensor‑matrix math.**  
- Its speed comes from **database‑engine optimisations** (column store, index‑driven filtering, compiled plans, streaming, parallel workers, caching).  
- **If you add a transformer to the pipeline** (e.g., embeddings for semantic search), that part will be **slower** than the pure GROQ query; the overall latency is the sum of the two.  
- Sanity’s “fast” claim **only applies to the GROQ portion**. Any AI‑heavy step is separate and will have the latency characteristics of the underlying model and serving infrastructure.

### What to do next?

1. **Identify the part of your workflow that really needs a transformer** (semantic search, auto‑generation, classification).  
2. **Isolate that step**: run it on a dedicated AI endpoint (OpenAI, Anthropic, self‑hosted quantised model).  
3. **Keep the GROQ side pure**: after you have the AI‑derived IDs/tags, fetch the final data with a *regular* GROQ query – you’ll retain the sub‑30 ms latency for the data‑retrieval part.  
4. **Measure** both stages separately (use `console.time` or a tracing tool). If AI latency dominates, experiment with quantisation, edge inference, or caching of embeddings.  

By separating the two concerns, you get the best of both worlds: **AI‑powered insight** when you need it, and **instant content retrieval** for everything else.
