Fruits are a cornerstone of a healthy diet, offering essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants that support overall well-being. Incorporating them daily can help lower blood pressure, reduce risks of heart disease, stroke, certain cancers, eye and digestive issues, and even aid in blood sugar control and weight management. They add natural sweetness, variety, and hydration to meals without excess calories.

## Recommended Daily Intake
Aim for at least 2 servings of fruit per day as part of a broader goal of 5+ servings of fruits and vegetables combined. A serving is typically one medium fruit (like an apple or orange), 1 cup of berries, or ½ cup of chopped fruit. For optimal benefits, include a rainbow of colors to get diverse nutrients—dark greens, yellow/orange, red, and citrus varieties most days. Studies show 8+ servings of fruits and veggies daily can cut heart attack or stroke risk by 30%, while whole fruits like berries and apples may lower type 2 diabetes risk.

- **Meals**: Add to salads, salsas, or as sides (e.g., grilled pineapple with chicken).
- **Desserts**: Opt for fresh over processed—freeze grapes or bake low-sugar crisps.

## General Selection, Storage, and Shopping Tips
- **Selecting**: Prioritize local/seasonal for peak flavor and nutrition—smell for ripeness, avoid bruises/mold.
- **Storing**: Most last longer in fridge (except bananas, tomatoes); wash only before eating to prevent spoilage. Use ethylene absorbers if mixing fruits/veggies.
- **Shopping Smart**: Buy in-season to save money and reduce waste; explore farmers' markets. Fill half your plate with produce for easy balance.
- **Pro Tip**: If increasing intake, start small—add one extra serving daily and experiment with recipes like fruit-infused water or veggie-fruit stir-fries.

Eating fruits daily is simple, delicious, and rewarding—adjust for preferences and availability to make it sustainable.
