title: MongoDB's Flexibility for LibreChat
translated: false
type: note
---

LibreChat, an open-source AI chatbot interface, defaults to MongoDB as its database primarily due to the flexibility of NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Unlike relational databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, which enforce fixed schemas and structured tables, MongoDB uses a document-based model that doesn't require predefined schemas. This makes it easier to handle evolving data structures—especially in a rapidly changing AI ecosystem where new models, conversation formats, and features are frequently added without needing extensive database migrations.

A developer from the LibreChat team has noted that MongoDB is "easily distributed and open enough to know its source code, which makes it widely available and reliable. Not least of all, it does allow flexibility as a NoSQL database with constantly changing data structures especially as AI services multiply and evolve." This aligns with the project's needs for scalability and adaptability in self-hosted or Docker-based setups, as seen in your container logs (e.g., the `chat-mongodb` container).

While MySQL and PostgreSQL are robust for transactional, relational data, they would add complexity for LibreChat's semi-structured data like user conversations, endpoints, and metadata. The project doesn't officially support switching to them without custom modifications, though community discussions explore MongoDB-compatible alternatives like FerretDB for fully open-source setups.
