This is a very good sentence to explain the correct use of a verb.

In the first version,

**"Fix Prompts or Context Instead of Output of AI"**,

the word "fix" is applied to three things: prompts, context, and AI.

Prompts or context cannot all be fixed. You can fix your user prompts but not system prompts. You need to add GPT to the GPT store to custom define a GPT instead of adding predefined related prompts every time.

I changed it to

**"Add Prompts or Context Instead of Output of AI"**

Now, the word "add" is applied to three things: prompts, context, and AI. But it's still not quite accurate because regarding output, you don't need to add; you just need to change or fix it.

So it should be

**"Add Prompts or Context Instead of Fixing Output of AI"**

Now, the verb "add" is applied to two words: prompts and context. The verb "fix" is applied to AI.

However, for prompts or context, sometimes you just need to change the prompts you provide.

**Final version:**

**"Fix Prompts or Context Instead of Output of AI"**

Though we are back to our original title, the thinking here is important. Every verb should be properly used, whether it applies to one thing or two things, or whether it is applied inappropriately to things it should apply to.
