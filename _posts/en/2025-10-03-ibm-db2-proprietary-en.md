title: IBM Db2 Is Proprietary Software

No, IBM Db2 is not an open-source technology. It's a proprietary relational database management system (RDBMS) developed and commercially licensed by IBM. While IBM offers a free "Db2 Community Edition" for development and testing purposes (with some limitations), the core product and its full features remain closed-source and require paid licensing for production use.

If you're looking for open-source alternatives, options like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MariaDB provide similar RDBMS capabilities without proprietary restrictions. Let me know if you need more details!
