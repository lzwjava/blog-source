title: Finding the Right Winter Gloves

Finding the right winter gloves for computer work has been a bit of a journey. Initially, I tried two-finger gloves, but they turned out to be impractical. The Mac touchpad requires the use of the middle finger along with the thumb and index finger for scrolling, which wasn’t possible with the two-finger design. Next, I tried five-finger gloves. While they provided better dexterity, they were too bulky for comfortable typing.

I’ve now ordered a sleeve-style pair of gloves and hope they’ll offer a better balance of warmth and functionality.

After using them for about an hour, I think they work well. In fact, I plan to buy another pair. These gloves are marketed as “cycling half-finger gloves,” and I believe they’ll be perfect for the entire winter season. Having two pairs will allow me to wash them and rotate usage.
