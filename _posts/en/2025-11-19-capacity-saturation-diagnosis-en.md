This is a classic case of **model capacity saturation** disguised as a training issue.

I have analyzed your logs and configuration deeply. The short answer is: **You are not training the model you think you are training.**

Here is the "hard thinking" breakdown of why your loss has plateaued and how to fix it.

-----

### 1\. The Critical Configuration Error (Size Mismatch)

You commented in your config:

> `# Model (~125M parameters) – perfect for 12 GB VRAM`

But your logs explicitly state:

> `number of parameters: 40.56M`

**Why this happened:**
You set `n_embd = 384`.

  * **Standard GPT-2 (124M):** `n_layer=12`, `n_head=12`, **`n_embd=768`**.
  * **Your Config:** `n_layer=12`, `n_head=12`, **`n_embd=384`**.

By halving the embedding dimension, you cut the parameter count by roughly a factor of 3-4 (because the majority of parameters are in the linear layers which scale quadratically with `n_embd`).

**The Result:** You are training a **40M parameter model**. A loss of \~3.57 is actually quite decent for a model this tiny. It has plateaued because **it is full**. It physically does not have the neurons to memorize or generalize more complex patterns from the FineWeb dataset.

### 2\. The "Val \< Train" Anomaly (Over-Regularization)

Look at your Step 14500:

  * `train loss`: 3.6415
  * `val loss`: 3.5696

**Diagnosis:** Your validation loss is *lower* than your training loss.
This usually happens when `dropout` is active during training but turned off during validation. You have `dropout = 0.1`.

**The Fix:** For a model this small (40M) trained on a dataset this massive (FineWeb), **you do not need dropout**. The model is effectively underfitting the infinite stream of data. Dropout is essentially deleting 10% of your tiny model's brain power during every step, making it harder for it to learn.

  * **Action:** Set `dropout = 0.0`.

### 3\. You have passed the "Chinchilla Optimal" Point

Let's do the math on your training volume:

  * **Batch size:** \~524,000 tokens per step.
  * **Current Step:** 14,500.
  * **Total Tokens Seen:** $14,500 \times 524,000 \approx 7.6 \text{ Billion tokens}$.

**Chinchilla Scaling Laws state:**
For a **40M** parameter model, the compute-optimal training volume is roughly $40M \times 20 \text{ tokens} = 800 \text{ Million tokens}$.

You have trained this model on **7.6 Billion tokens**. You have fed it nearly **10x** the optimal amount of data.

  * The plateau is expected. You have squeezed almost every drop of performance possible out of 40M parameters. Continuing to train will yield diminishing returns (as you are seeing now).

### 4\. Performance Bottleneck (MFU is low)

Your Model Flops Utilization (MFU) is hovering around **11-12%**.

  * On an RTX 4070, with `compile=True`, you should aim for 30%+.
  * The warning `Not enough SMs to use max_autotune_gemm` suggests your batch size or model architecture size doesn't align well with the GPU hardware causing padding/inefficiency.
  * However, fixing MFU will only make the training *faster*, it will not lower the loss if the model is already saturated.

### Solution: How to get Unstuck

To get the loss down to \~3.0 or lower (standard for GPT-2 small), you need to increase the brain size.

#### Step 1: Correct the Model Config

To get the actual **124M** model you wanted:

```python
n_layer = 12
n_head = 12
n_embd = 768  # CHANGED from 384 to 768
dropout = 0.0 # CHANGED from 0.1 (Data is large enough, don't throttle the model)
```

#### Step 2: Adjust Batch Size for VRAM

Since you are increasing the model width (`n_embd`), your VRAM usage will go up. You are currently using `batch_size=16`.

  * If you run out of memory (OOM) with `n_embd=768` on your 12GB card, reduce `batch_size` to `8` or `4` and increase `gradient_accumulation_steps` to keep the total tokens per step around 500k.

#### Step 3: Reset and Retrain

You cannot resume from the current checkpoint because the model architecture (embedding size) will change. You must start from `iter 0`.

**What to expect:**
With `n_embd=768`, you should see the loss drop significantly faster and break through the 3.5 barrier, likely settling around 3.2 or 3.0 by step 10,000.

**Would you like me to calculate the exact `gradient_accumulation_steps` needed to maintain your training stability with the larger model size?**
