title: Forgetfulness about Charging Power Banks
translated: false
---

The problem of often forgetting to charge power banks has been frustrating me.

I have two small electric lamps that I've been using recently. I had two power banks a week ago and I have three mobile phones. I was frustrated to find that both of my power banks were out of electricity, so I bought a third one.

I was initially happy to have three power banks, but the happiness didn't last long. Today, I found that all three of my power banks were out of electricity, and I needed one to charge my iPhone 14 Pro Max.

Why did this happen?

The reason is that I often forget to charge them after using them. Regardless of how many power banks I buy, if I don't charge one after using it, I will eventually deplete all of them.

The first power bank is a Ugreen MagSafe wireless power bank with a 10,000 mAh capacity. The second and third ones are power banks with built-in cables, both also with 10,000 mAh capacities.

When they are all fully charged, I have 30,000 mAh of portable electricity. If I use some of them, I need to recharge them to maintain a considerable amount of power.

But why do I forget to charge them? It's similar to being lazy about washing dishes after a meal, even though it just means putting the dishes in the dishwasher.

Charging the power bank is very easy. I just need to stand up from my reclining pillow and walk one meter away to plug it in.

It's not about the effort or energy. In many cases, I just don't want anything to interrupt my activities like writing blogs, chatting with AI chatbots, or writing code.

Recently, I bought a power strip to help charge my Mac laptop as I work in bed, since there are no sockets nearby.

So, my solution is to use that power strip to charge my three phones as well. This way, I can use the power banks less frequently if I don't want to charge them. A power strip has sockets in it, so it's like having sockets near the bed.

Another solution is to use the Shortcuts app in iOS to set a notification to remind me to check or charge the power banks at a certain time each day.

By the way, I thought of a new kind of charging method: a [Smart Universal Charger Box](./charger-box-en). I introduced it in another article. Actually, this is a different problem. It is about how to charge, not about solving the issue of forgetting to charge power banks.
