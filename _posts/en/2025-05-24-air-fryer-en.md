An air fryer works by circulating hot air at high speed to cook food, producing a crispy exterior similar to deep frying but with minimal oil. Here's how it operates:

1. **Heating Element**: A powerful electric coil (usually located at the top) generates intense heat, typically reaching temperatures between 175°F and 400°F (80°C to 200°C).

2. **Fan Circulation**: A high-speed fan rapidly circulates the hot air around the food, which is placed in a perforated basket or tray. This ensures even heat distribution, cooking the food uniformly.

3. **Convection Effect**: The rapid air movement creates a convection effect, where the hot air transfers heat to the food's surface. This cooks the exterior quickly, forming a crispy layer while keeping the inside moist.

4. **Maillard Reaction**: The high heat triggers the Maillard reaction, a chemical process between amino acids and sugars in the food, giving it the golden-brown color, crisp texture, and savory flavor associated with frying.

5. **Minimal Oil Use**: Unlike traditional deep frying, air fryers require little to no oil (often just a light coating). The circulating air mimics the effect of oil by evenly crisping the food’s surface.

6. **Exhaust System**: Most air fryers have a vent to release excess heat and moisture, helping maintain the crispy texture and preventing sogginess.

The food is placed in a basket with perforations to allow air flow, and the user sets the temperature and time (typically 5-25 minutes, depending on the recipe). Some models include additional features like preset cooking modes or shaking mechanisms to ensure even cooking.

This technology allows air fryers to prepare foods like fries, chicken wings, or vegetables with up to 80% less fat than traditional frying, making them popular for healthier cooking.

Using an air fryer to cook everyday foods is straightforward and versatile. Here’s a concise guide to prepare common dishes like vegetables, chicken, fries, or fish:

1. **Preheat the Air Fryer**: Set the temperature (usually 350°F–400°F or 175°C–200°C) and preheat for 3–5 minutes, if required by your model. Some air fryers don’t need preheating.

2. **Prepare the Food**:
   - **Vegetables**: Toss veggies (e.g., zucchini, broccoli, or carrots) in 1–2 tsp of oil, salt, and spices. Cut uniformly for even cooking.
   - **Chicken**: Season chicken breasts, thighs, or wings with spices or marinade. Lightly coat with oil for crispiness.
   - **Fries**: Use frozen fries or cut fresh potatoes into sticks, soak in water for 30 minutes to remove starch, pat dry, and toss with 1–2 tsp oil and seasoning.
   - **Fish**: Coat fillets (e.g., salmon or cod) with a light layer of oil and seasoning or breadcrumbs for texture.

3. **Arrange in Basket**: Place food in a single layer in the air fryer basket, avoiding overcrowding to ensure proper air circulation. For larger items like chicken, use a rack if provided.

4. **Set Temperature and Time**:
   - **Vegetables**: 350°F–380°F (175°C–190°C) for 8–15 minutes, shaking or flipping halfway.
   - **Chicken**: 360°F–400°F (180°C–200°C) for 15–25 minutes, flipping halfway. Ensure internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) for safety.
   - **Fries**: 400°F (200°C) for 15–20 minutes, shaking every 5–7 minutes for even crisping.
   - **Fish**: 375°F–400°F (190°C–200°C) for 8–12 minutes, flipping halfway.
   (Times vary by model and food size; check your air fryer’s manual for specifics.)

5. **Shake or Flip**: For even cooking, shake the basket or flip larger items halfway through to expose all sides to the hot air.

6. **Check Doneness**: Use a meat thermometer for proteins or visually check for golden, crispy textures. Add 2–3 minutes if needed.

7. **Serve Immediately**: Air-fried food is best enjoyed fresh for maximum crispiness. Avoid covering to prevent sogginess.

**Tips**:
- Use minimal oil (1–2 tsp) for crisp results; too much can smoke or make food greasy.
- Clean the basket after each use to prevent residue buildup.
- Experiment with seasonings or marinades for variety.
- Don’t overfill the basket; cook in batches if needed.
