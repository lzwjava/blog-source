title: Why Jet Contrails Are Straight
translated: false
type: note

### Explanation in English

The provided text describes why the visible white trails (often called contrails or vapor trails) from passenger jet engines appear straight, likening them to the focused flame from a welding torch or a windproof lighter. Here's a clear English breakdown of the key points:

- **Observation**: When water vapor emerges from a jet engine (if conditions allow it to be visible), it shoots out in a straight line, not diffuse or wavy.
  
- **Why? Engine Mechanics**: Airplanes propel themselves using jet engines that burn fuel. Incoming air from the front intake is rapidly heated by combustion, causing it to expand dramatically. This hot, expanded gas is then expelled at high speed from the rear exhaust, creating thrust (Newton's third law: action-reaction force) to push the plane forward. The process inside the engine is:
  1. Air enters and gets compressed by the compressor blades into high-pressure air.
  2. This mixes thoroughly with fuel sprayed into the combustion chamber.
  3. Ignition causes a fast-burning reaction, leading to violent expansion of the gases.
  4. The resulting exhaust blasts out the back at extremely high velocities (often hundreds of meters per second).

- **Formation of Visible Trails**: If the surrounding air has high relative humidity (e.g., 90%), combined with extra water vapor produced from fuel combustion (hydrocarbon fuel + oxygen → CO₂ + H₂O), the hot exhaust can become "supersaturated" with moisture as it mixes with and cools in the colder outside air. This triggers condensation: excess water vapor turns into tiny visible droplets (or ice crystals), forming the white trail we see. Importantly, these trails stay straight because of the exhaust's immense speed and pressure, which keeps the flow focused and laminar (smooth, not turbulent) right at the exit.

In essence, it's a vivid analogy for how jet thrust creates a high-velocity, straight "plume" that can condense into a visible streak under the right atmospheric conditions.

### Analysis: Is This True?

Yes, this explanation is **mostly accurate** as a simplified overview of jet engine operation and contrail formation, grounded in basic thermodynamics and aviation science. It captures the core physics well for a general audience, but there are a few nuances and minor simplifications worth noting for precision:

- **Strengths (What's Spot-On)**:
  - **Engine Cycle**: This is a solid layperson's description of the Brayton (gas turbine) cycle in turbofan jet engines, which power most commercial airliners. Compression, fuel-air mixing, combustion-induced expansion, and high-speed exhaust for thrust are all correct. Exhaust velocities can exceed 300–600 m/s (over 1,000 km/h), ensuring a straight, forceful jet—much like the focused flame in the analogies.
  - **Thrust Mechanism**: The reaction force from expelling mass at high speed is exactly how jets work (per Newton's laws).
  - **Water Vapor Source**: Fuel combustion does produce significant H₂O (about 1.2–1.4 kg per kg of jet fuel burned), adding to ambient humidity.
  - **Condensation Process**: "Supersaturation" is the right term—the exhaust starts hot and moist (near 100% humidity from combustion), then adiabatically cools and mixes with cold air (often -40°C or lower at cruising altitudes of 30,000–40,000 ft). This drops the temperature below the dew point, causing rapid nucleation of water droplets or ice crystals. High ambient humidity (above ~70% relative humidity with respect to ice) promotes persistent trails.
  - **Straight Appearance**: Contrails form as a narrow, straight plume initially because the exhaust is ejected in a coherent, high-momentum stream. Turbulence or wind shear can later spread or curve them, but at the source, they're straight due to velocity and pressure gradients. This matches observations: trails hug the flight path closely.

- **Minor Inaccuracies or Oversimplifications**:
  - **Trail Composition**: The text calls them "white small water droplets" (水珠), which is close but not fully precise. At formation, they start as supercooled water droplets, but in the cold upper atmosphere, they quickly freeze into ice crystals (typically 1–10 micrometers across). This is why contrails often persist longer than ground-level vapor—ice sublimes slowly. It's a nitpick, though; the visibility comes from light scattering off these particles either way.
  - **Humidity Context**: The 90% example is illustrative, but contrails form specifically at high altitudes where air is cold enough for ice supersaturation, not just high humidity at sea level. Ground-level "vapor puffs" during humid takeoffs are similar but shorter-lived and rarer for passenger jets. The text seems geared toward high-altitude contrails.
  - **"If Any" Visibility**: Not all flights produce visible trails; it depends on temperature, humidity, and engine efficiency. Modern high-bypass turbofans produce less soot (which acts as condensation nuclei), so trails can be fainter.
  - **No Mention of Altitude**: The straightness and persistence are enhanced at cruise altitudes due to stable stratospheric air, but the engine explanation holds regardless.

Overall, this is about 90% correct—reliable for explaining the "wow" factor without diving into equations like the Schmidt-Appleman criterion (which predicts contrail formation based on exhaust temp, pressure, and ambient conditions). It's a great starting point for curiosity about aviation weather.
