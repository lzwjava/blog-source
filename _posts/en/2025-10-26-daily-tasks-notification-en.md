### Setting Up a Daily Recurring Notification in Google Tasks

Google Tasks supports recurring tasks with notifications tied to a due date and time. The good news is that the next instance of a recurring task will appear automatically on its scheduled date **regardless of whether you mark the current one as complete**. This means you don't *have* to mark it done for the reminders to keep coming every day—the cycle continues on its own.

However, if you don't mark the task complete, the current day's instance will stay in your task list as "overdue" after the due time passes. This might clutter your view slightly, but the notification itself will fire only once per day at the set time, and you can dismiss it (making the notification disappear) without any further action. If you want the task entry to vanish from the list too (for a cleaner experience), you'd need to mark it complete—but that's optional since the reminders won't stop.

Here's how to set it up for your "buy food from JD.com" example:

1. Open the **Google Tasks app** on your phone (or access it via Gmail/Calendar web).
2. Tap the **+** to create a new task.
3. Enter the title: **Buy food from JD.com**.
4. Tap **Add date/time** and set the first due date/time (e.g., tomorrow at 8:00 AM, when you want the daily notification).
5. Next to "Date/time," tap **Repeat**.
6. Choose **Daily** (or custom if needed).
7. Under "Ends," select **Never** (or set an end date if you want it temporary).
8. Tap **OK** > **Save**.

- **Notifications**: Go to your phone's system settings > Apps > Google Tasks > Notifications, and ensure they're enabled. The app will push a notification at the exact due time each day.
- **What happens daily**: You'll get one alert. Dismiss it, and the notification goes away. The task entry lingers until completed (if you choose to), but a new instance auto-appears the next day for the fresh reminder.
- **Viewing/editing**: In the Tasks app, overdue tasks show at the top by default. You can switch to "Scheduled" view to focus on upcoming ones.

If the lingering overdue tasks bother you, marking complete is quick (tap the circle next to the task) and instantly spawns the next clean instance—no extra steps needed. But if you truly want zero interaction beyond dismissing the notification, this setup gets you 90% there, as the core repetition doesn't depend on completion.

If this doesn't quite fit (e.g., you want *zero* task entries visible), consider Google Assistant as an alternative: Say "Hey Google, remind me every day at 8 AM to buy food from JD.com." This creates a similar recurring alert via the Google app's Reminders section, which syncs to Tasks but behaves more like a pure alarm (dismiss and forget, with no visible task buildup). It notifies daily without requiring any marking.
