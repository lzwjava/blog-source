An **equal opportunity employer (EOE)** is a business or organization that commits to hiring, promoting, and treating employees without discrimination based on protected characteristics. These typically include race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), national origin, age (usually 40+), disability, genetic information, and sometimes other factors like veteran status or pregnancy.

### Key Points:
- **Legal Basis**: In the US, this stems from federal laws like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Similar laws exist in many other countries (e.g., the Equality Act 2010 in the UK).
- **Why It Matters**: Companies often include "EOE" in job postings to signal compliance and attract diverse candidates. It doesn't mean they *always* achieve perfect equality, but it prohibits unfair bias in employment decisions.
- **Affirmative Action**: Some EOEs go further with proactive steps to recruit underrepresented groups, though this can vary by location and isn't required everywhere.

If you're seeing this in a job ad or policy, it's a standard disclaimer promoting fairness. For specifics in your area, check local labor laws.
