### Summary of Yin Wang's Article on Fluoride Toothpaste

Yin Wang, in his February 3, 2023, Substack post titled "含氟牙膏" (Fluoride Toothpaste), expresses strong skepticism toward fluoride toothpaste, portraying it as an unnecessary and potentially harmful product pushed by misleading "science" and medicine. He argues that modern people are blindly ingesting toxins like fluoride without realizing it, and he urges readers to abandon it in favor of simpler, natural dental care. Below is a breakdown of his key points, translated and explained in English for clarity.

#### The Root Cause of Cavities: Acids, Not a Need for Fluoride
- Wang simplifies tooth decay (cavities) as erosion caused by acids on tooth enamel over time.
- **Sources of acid**:
  - **Sugar**: Bacteria in the mouth break down sugars from food and drinks, producing acids that stick to teeth and crevices, leading to corrosion.
  - **Fruits**: Citrus fruits contain citric acid, but this rinses away easily with water, making it less problematic than sticky sugars.
- He emphasizes that meat, vegetables, and non-sugary foods don't produce these acids, so there's no need to brush immediately after every meal.

#### Simple Prevention: No Toothpaste Required
- Wang claims preventing cavities is straightforward and doesn't require any "special substances" like fluoride:
  - Reduce or avoid sugar and sugary foods/drinks.
  - After eating sweets, rinse your mouth with plain water to remove residues.
  - After fruits, swish water to dilute acids.
- He argues that brushing right after meals (especially acidic ones) might even spread acids further, and water alone suffices for basic hygiene.

#### Critique of Fluoride Toothpaste: A Pesticide in Disguise?
- **Composition and promotion**: Most toothpastes contain sodium fluoride (NaF), which Wang notes is originally a pesticide used for insect control. He questions why "science" deems small doses safe and encourages daily use, especially since non-fluoride options are hard to find in stores.
- **Logical contradiction**: If cavity prevention is so simple (via diet and water), why aggressively market fluoride toothpaste? Wang sees this as evidence of ulterior motives—perhaps profit-driven—without needing experiments to prove harm.
- **Long-term risks**: Even if not immediately toxic, daily exposure to a pesticide-like substance could accumulate and contribute to unexplained modern illnesses, which medicine attributes to other causes. He admits lacking direct evidence of harm but chooses avoidance on principle.

#### Debunking the "Science" Behind Fluoride's Benefits
- **Medical claims**: Wang mocks the idea that fluoride combines with tooth minerals (e.g., calcium) to form fluorapatite crystals, which supposedly create a harder, acid-resistant enamel layer. Some doctors even recommend pre-meal brushing to form a "protective coating."
- **His counterargument**: This sounds like pseudoscience. Replacing natural tooth components with artificial fluoride might weaken enamel, making it more brittle or prone to damage under stress. He views synthetic "replacements" as inferior to nature's originals and warns against blindly trusting unverified claims.
- **Broader distrust**: Wang reflects on his past faith in "science," now seeing it—especially medicine—as deceptive and not true science at all. He implies fluoride promotion exemplifies how "pseudoscience" deceives the public.

#### Conclusion: Avoid Fluoride Entirely
- Wang concludes that fluoride toothpaste is unnecessary at best and dangerous at worst. He's stopped using it personally, advocating for natural habits to preserve teeth's original structure.
- The piece ends on a philosophical note: People must question "scientific" narratives to avoid hidden toxins.

This is an opinionated essay blending personal anecdote, basic biology, and conspiracy-tinged critique. Wang writes in a conversational, persuasive style to rally readers against what he sees as over-medicalization of everyday health.
