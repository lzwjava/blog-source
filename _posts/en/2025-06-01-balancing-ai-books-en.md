Your situation reflects several interesting aspects of modern behavior, cognitive habits, and potential psychological patterns. Here’s a breakdown of what it might signify and how to think about it:

### 1. **Information Consumption vs. Creation**
   - **Chatbots vs. Books**: You’re likely drawn to AI chatbots because they offer **instant, interactive, and tailored** answers to your questions, whereas books require slower, linear engagement. This reflects a broader shift in how we process information: from deep, sustained focus (books) to quick, transactional interactions (chatbots). 
   - **Pros of Chatbots**: Faster answers, dynamic dialogue, and the ability to explore ideas without committing to a full book.
   - **Cons of Chatbots**: Lack of depth, no structured narrative or curated knowledge (books often present ideas in a more refined way), and potential "shallowing" of your thinking over time.

   → **Reflection**: Are you seeking *knowledge* or just *answers*? Books build foundational understanding; chatbots are great for specific queries or brainstorming. Balance both.

### 2. **The Collector’s Dilemma**
   - **Books as Aspirational Purchases**: Buying books can feel like progress (the "I’ll read this someday" effect), but accumulating them without reading may signal:
     - **Overestimating future free time** (planning fallacy).
     - **Enjoying the idea of learning more than the act** (a common dopamine-driven behavior).
     - **Avoidance**—sometimes collecting substitutes for doing the hard work of deep reading/making.
   - **Circuit Boards & Small Stuff**: Similarly, owning tools/materials without using them may reflect:
     - **A desire to tinker/explore** (which is good!).
     - **Analysis paralysis** (too many options = no action).
     - **Fear of failure** (not starting because you worry you won’t do it "right").

   → **Reflection**: Try the "5-minute rule"—commit to just 5 minutes of reading or tinkering. Often, starting is the hardest part.

### 3. **Movies & Passive Consumption**
   - Not watching movies isn’t inherently bad—it might mean you prefer **active engagement** (chatbots, projects) over passive consumption. Or it could reflect **time scarcity** or **decision fatigue** (too many choices = avoid all).
   - Movies/books/chatbots serve different needs: 
     - Movies: Emotional/story-driven immersion. 
     - Books: Deep knowledge. 
     - Chatbots: Quick problem-solving.

   → **Reflection**: If you miss movies, schedule them intentionally. Otherwise, don’t stress—it’s okay to prioritize what fits your current goals.

### 4. **Why This Matters**
   - **Cognitive Load**: Too many unread books/unused items can subconsciously weigh on you ("clutter stress").
   - **Skill Decay**: Without applying knowledge (from books or hands-on projects), it’s harder to retain or master skills.
   - **Identity vs. Action**: You might identify as a "learner" or "maker," but without action, that identity can feel unfulfilled.

### **What You Can Do**
1. **Audit Your Collections**:
   - Pick 10 books to donate/sell. Keep only those you’re truly excited to read.
   - For circuit boards: Start one small project this week (e.g., blink an LED). 

2. **Hybrid Learning**:
   - Use chatbots to **augment** books (e.g., ask AI to explain a concept from a book in simpler terms).
   - Set a rule: For every 1 hour of chatbot use, spend 30 minutes reading.

3. **Time Blocking**:
   - Schedule 20-minute "book sessions" or "tinkering time" in your calendar. Treat it like a meeting.

4. **Reframe Goals**:
   - Instead of "read all these books," aim for **1 chapter/week**.
   - Instead of "build something impressive," aim for **15 minutes of play** with circuits.

### **Key Takeaway**
This isn’t about "wasting" books or supplies—it’s about aligning your habits with your intentions. Chatbots are tools, not replacements for deep learning or making. The fact you’re questioning this suggests you crave more tangible progress. Start small, and enjoy the process!
