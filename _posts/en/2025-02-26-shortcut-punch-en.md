title: Automated Punch-In with Shortcuts
translated: false
---

Use the Shortcuts app to create a shortcut that triggers when you arrive at the office. This shortcut will automatically open the WeCom app, enabling you to punch in.

By setting up a location-based trigger (arriving at or leaving a specific area), you can automate the process of opening the WeCom app. Within WeCom, you can further configure automatic punch-in/punch-out functionality.
