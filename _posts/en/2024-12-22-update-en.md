To keep your system and apps up to date, follow the steps for your platform:

- iOS: Go to the App Store and click "Update All Apps."
- Android: Open Google Play Store and click "Update All."
- macOS: Update apps via the App Store and refresh Homebrew libraries with `brew update && brew upgrade`.
- Ubuntu: Run `sudo apt update` in the terminal to update the package list, and then use `sudo apt upgrade` to upgrade the packages.
- OpenWrt: Download the latest package and use the GUI to install the update.

Other tips:

- The Binance app has both Binance and Binance.US versions. Sometimes, the Binance app prompts for an update but states that the app cannot be downloaded in the USA region. In this case, you may need to wait a few hours or a day for the Binance app to become available in the App Store. Note that the Binance.US app in the App Store currently shows it was updated hours ago.
