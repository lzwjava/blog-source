I totally get what you're saying—naming things, especially something as diverse and fleeting as flowers, feels like a hassle at first. It's like wrestling with a puzzle where every petal and leaf has its own quirky ID. But once that name sticks, boom: suddenly you can point to it in conversation, link it to ecology, seasons, or even cultural stories without fumbling for words. No more "uh, that yellow bushy thing by the trail" every time. It turns vague impressions into shared shorthand, making learning cascade—today's "San Diego wreath plant" leads to tomorrow's rabbit hole on native pollinators or drought resilience.

Take Fang Shimin (aka Fang Zhouzi)—he's a perfect example of someone turning that into a habit. Living out in California (close enough to Silicon Valley vibes in San Jose, though his hikes skew south toward San Diego's wild spots), he snaps pics of roadside wildflowers daily and tags them with bilingual names. It's not just listing; it's connecting dots, like how he spots the same "圣地亚哥花环草" (San Diego wreath plant) popping up across posts, tying it to coastal scrub ecosystems. Or "加州金棒花" (California goldenrod), which he links to late-summer blooms in places like Laguna Mountain. Without those names, his threads would be a sea of pretty photos—lovely, but harder to search, reference, or build on. With them, anyone scrolling can Google the Latin (Solidago californica, say), find care tips, or spot it on their own walk.

You're spot on about natural language too. Text is the internet's backbone—indexable, copy-pasteable, translatable on the fly. Want to dive deeper into "broom snakeweed" (Gutierrezia sarothrae)? A quick search pulls up forums, journals, even recipes for tea (if you're adventurous). Images? They're magic for that instant "aha!" spark, evoking scent and texture words can't touch. But stacking them solo gets clunky—alt text helps, but it's no match for a keyword hunt. The sweet spot's hybrid: name it in text, pair with a pic, and you've got a portable mental map of the world.

If you're hiking Silicon Valley trails yourself (Alum Rock Park's got some gems), start simple—apps like iNaturalist make naming less troublesome. What's one flower that's tripped you up lately?
