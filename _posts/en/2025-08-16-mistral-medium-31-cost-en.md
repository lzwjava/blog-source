You’re asking how “costly” Mistral Medium 3.1 is — got it. Let me break it down clearly, without the clutter.

---

## Pricing of Mistral Medium 3.1

Based on the latest data:

* **Input tokens** cost **\$0.40 per 1 million tokens**.
* **Output tokens** cost **\$2.00 per 1 million tokens**.
  ([Mistral AI][1])

Some sources present a blended average — around **\$0.80 per million tokens**, assuming a typical 3:1 ratio of inputs to outputs (i.e., 3 units of input for each 1 unit of output).

## Is That “Costly”?

**It depends on what you're comparing it to**:

* Compared to higher-end models like GPT‑4, this is very economical — Mistral Medium 3 (and by extension 3.1) delivers near state-of-the-art performance at up to **8× lower cost**.
  ([Mistral AI][3])

* An internal efficiency metric shows it delivers GPT‑4-level reasoning at roughly **20 % of the cost**, making it a budget-friendly option for serious AI workloads.
  ([Mistral AI][1])

* In purely token-based comparison: if you send 1 million tokens, you pay \$0.40. When the model responds with 1 million tokens, that’s \$2.00 more. A balanced 3:1 exchange might average out to around \$0.80 per million tokens — still quite reasonable.
  ([Artificial Analysis][2])

### Bottom Line

* **Is Mistral Medium 3.1 expensive?**
  **Not really.** It offers high-end performance for a fraction of the cost of premium models like GPT-4.

* **Token costs are modest** — \$0.40 for inputs and \$2.00 for outputs per million tokens, averaging around \$0.80 if you assume a normal mix.

Fancy running the numbers for your expected usage (like if you’re sending 10,000 tokens per prompt or expect certain reply lengths)? Just say the word—I can help you estimate!
