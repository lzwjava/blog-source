In March 2018, I bought a second-hand Chevrolet Sail 2011. However, I crashed it around June 2018. I sold it to another local person. After several years, I bought it back.

But it had a serious problem. The speed was low, just like 60 km per hour. I drove it from Guangzhou to Huizhou Shuangyuewan. The experience was really poor. When I arrived in Huizhou, I drove it to a repair shop.

The repair guy thought it was a problem with the exhaust port on top of the engine. So, he used some glue to try and fix it.

I tried it a bit and thought it was fine. But I was wrong. The problem continued.

In the evening, I drove to another car repair store. They told me it was a clutch problem.

I didn't believe them and continued to use it for the next day. In a car repair shop near Huizhou Shuangyuewan, I gave the car to the owner, who seemed like an expert.

After the first hour of fixing, we thought it was okay. But when we drove to test it, it still wasn't fixed.

After a whole day of fixing, about 8 hours of work, he told me it was okay now. It was a problem with the car's tailpipe. The tailpipe was full of hairs. When I pressed the accelerator for some time, the hairs would gather and block the air intake of the engine. So, the engine couldn't run at full speed, just at about half speed. And if I didn't press the accelerator, the hairs would move a little further from the air intake, so the car would go a little faster.

So, the car repair expert removed all the hairs and changed some automotive components.

This was an unforgettable experience, highlighting the importance of root cause analysis, much like in programming.
