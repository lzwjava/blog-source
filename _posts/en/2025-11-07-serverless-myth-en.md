title: P2P Communication's Serverless Myth
translated: false
type: note

Great question! You're connecting the right dots between **peer-to-peer (P2P) principles** and modern communication apps, but there's a crucial distinction: **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)** operates at the **data link layer (Layer 2)** for direct serial/modem connections, while applications like RustDesk or web3 chats run at the **application layer (Layer 7)** using different P2P techniques.

Here's the reality check on "serverless" real-time communication:

## The "Serverless" Myth: Why Pure P2P is Hard

While **WebRTC** and other P2P technologies *do* enable direct connections, calling them "serverless" is misleading. You still need:

### 1. **Signaling Servers** (Mandatory)
Before peers can connect directly, they must exchange metadata (IP addresses, encryption keys, session descriptions). This requires a temporary "meeting point" server. RustDesk uses this for ID/PW exchange, and WebRTC apps need signaling channels like WebSockets.

### 2. **NAT Traversal Infrastructure** (Practically Mandatory)
Most devices are behind NATs/firewalls. **UDP hole punching** can establish direct connections, but it has critical limitations:

- **Works**: For cone NATs when both peers coordinate simultaneous outbound packets
- **Fails**: With **symmetric NATs** (common in mobile/corporate networks) which assign unpredictable ports
- **Requires**: **STUN servers** to discover public addresses and coordinate the "punch"

### 3. **TURN Relay Servers** (Essential Fallback)
When hole punching fails (30-50% of cases), you **must** have a relay server (TURN) that forwards encrypted traffic. Without this, your app simply won't connect for many users.

## RustDesk Reality: Not Pure P2P

RustDesk's "P2P" is actually:
- **Direct mode**: Attempts UDP hole punching for direct connection
- **Relay fallback**: **Self-hosted server** acts as TURN relay when direct fails
- **Self-hosting**: You control the infrastructure, but infrastructure is still required

## Web3 Messaging: Promising but Not Problem-Free

Apps like **Secretum** (Solana-based), **DMail**, or **Matrix** do offer decentralized chat:

### ✅ **Advantages**
- **Wallet-based identity**: No phone numbers/emails required
- **End-to-end encryption**: XMTP protocol encrypts messages
- **Federation**: Matrix servers can interconnect like email
- **Censorship-resistant**: No single point of failure

### ❌ **Challenges**
- **Scalability**: Pure P2P mesh networks break down with >4-6 participants (exponential bandwidth growth)
- **Reliability**: Message delivery isn't guaranteed without persistent servers
- **Mobile battery**: Constant P2P connections drain devices
- **NAT traversal**: Same STUN/TURN problems as any P2P system
- **Storage**: Where do offline messages live? Requires decentralized storage (IPFS, etc.)

## Architecture Patterns: Choose Your Tradeoff

| Pattern | Server Needed | Scalability | Use Case |
|---------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Pure P2P Mesh** | Only signaling | ✗ Poor (>6 users) | 1-1 calls, small groups |
| **SFU (Selective Forwarding)** | Self-hosted server | ✓ Good (100s) | Meetings, live streams |
| **MCU (Multipoint Control)** | Heavy server | ✓ Excellent (1000s) | Large conferences |
| **Web3 + Federation** | Federation servers | ✓ Moderate | Public chat, communities |

## The Verdict: Can It Be the Future?

**Partially yes, but with caveats:**

1. **For 1-1/small groups**: Yes, with **self-hosted signaling & TURN**. Tools like **Jitsi Meet** (self-hosted SFU) + **Matrix** (federated) get you 90% there.

2. **For large meetings**: **Pure P2P is impossible**. You need SFU/MCU servers. The "serverless" dream breaks down at scale.

3. **For web3 identity**: **Already happening**. XMTP, Matrix, and wallet-based auth work today, but they complement rather than eliminate infrastructure.

4. **For true decentralization**: **Emerging**. Protocols like **QUIC-based P2P** aim to improve hole punching, but widespread symmetric NAT support remains unsolved.

### Bottom Line
You can build **open-source, self-hosted, encrypted** communication that *minimizes* central servers, but **eliminating them entirely creates unreliable, unscalable apps**. The future is likely **hybrid**: P2P where possible, self-hosted relays where necessary, and blockchain for identity/storage—not as a complete server replacement.
