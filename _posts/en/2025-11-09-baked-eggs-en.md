### Simple Oven-Baked Eggs in the Shell for 2 Eggs

This method bakes whole eggs directly in the shell for easy peeling and consistent results—no cracking required. It's like oven "boiling" and works great in an electric oven. Aim for hard-boiled style (adjust time for softer yolks). You'll need a muffin tin or small baking dish.

#### Ingredients
- 2 large eggs (straight from the fridge for best results)
- Salt, to taste (for sprinkling after peeling)

#### Instructions
1. **Preheat the oven**: Set your electric oven to 325°F (165°C) and position a rack in the middle.
2. **Prepare the eggs**: Place the 2 eggs in a muffin tin (one per cup) or a small baking dish to keep them upright and prevent rolling.
3. **Bake**: Put the tin/dish in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes for hard-boiled eggs (yolks fully set). For softer yolks, reduce to 20-22 minutes.
4. **Cool**: Remove from the oven and immediately transfer the eggs to an ice bath (bowl of ice water) for 5-10 minutes to stop cooking and make peeling easier.
5. **Peel and serve**: Gently tap and peel under cool running water. Sprinkle with salt and enjoy as is, in salads, or on toast.

#### Tips
- Electric ovens heat evenly, but test one egg first if your oven runs hot/cold.
- Store peeled eggs in the fridge for up to 1 week.
- For extra flavor, add a dash of vinegar to the ice bath to help with peeling.
