Below is my assoiciate progress. 

Guangdong University of Foreign Studies，Computer Application, Associate Degree, 2022.10 - Present

- National Higher Education Self-study Examination. Passed 9 courses as of today, Introduction to Operating Systems, Introduction to Data Structures, Advanced Language Programming (I), English (I), Advanced Mathematics, Database and Applications, Computer Application Technology, Introduction to Law and Computer Organization and Architecture.
- Currently preparing for 7 courses such as Computer Networks, Basic Electronic Technology (III), Microcomputer and Interface Technology, Mao Zedong Thought and Theory of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, Ideological and Moral Cultivation and Rule of Law, College Chinese and Linear Algebra.

I am unhappy about my progress. It is slow. The reason is that I mainly prepare it for one year until now.

## Reasons for passing courses
* Already had good understanding before the exam, like Introduction to Data Structures and English
* Prepared well enough in the past year, like Advanced Mathematics and Database Applications
* For **Introduction to Law**, I answered almost all questions—even if some answers were improvised.
* For **Computer Organization Principles**, I had prior background knowledge and practiced past exam questions multiple times.

## Reasons for failed courses
* Thought that I had already prepared well, but actually hadn't. The exercises I did for the failed subjects were apparently fewer than for the passed courses. 
* Did not give enough time to prepare
* Just walked through videos of the subjects pretending to understand.

## Reasons for Selected Failed Courses

### Computer Networks
- Insufficient practice with exam-style questions
- Lack of foundational knowledge in computer network theory

### Linear Algebra
- Inadequate familiarity with matrix operations and rules
- Overestimated understanding of the subject
- Lack of hands-on practice; relied solely on video lectures

## Exam preparation
* Sleep well, maintain a good routine for sleep
* Morning and afternoon exams may be in different locations, check the right locations
* Register for the exam on time
