### Understanding the Issue
You're encountering a common APT lock conflict on Ubuntu/Debian systems. The lock file `/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend` is held by another `apt` process (PID 6761), preventing your `--fix-broken install` command from proceeding. This often happens if an update, install, or upgrade is stuck or running in the background. Suspending with `Ctrl+Z` (which put it in job [1]) doesn't release the lock.

### Steps to Resolve
Follow these in order—**start with checking, not killing**, to avoid interrupting a legitimate operation.

1. **Check the Running Process**  
   See what's using PID 6761:  
   ```
   ps aux | grep 6761
   ```  
   Or more broadly:  
   ```
   ps aux | grep -E "(apt|dpkg)"
   ```  
   - If it's an active update (e.g., via `apt upgrade` or Software Updater), wait for it to finish or let it complete.  
   - If it's stuck (no output or it's hung), proceed to kill it.

2. **Kill the Blocking Process (If Stuck)**  
   Gently terminate it:  
   ```
   sudo kill 6761
   ```  
   If that doesn't work (process ignores SIGTERM):  
   ```
   sudo kill -9 6761
   ```  
   - Verify it's gone: `ps aux | grep 6761` (should return nothing relevant).

3. **Remove Lock Files**  
   Once the process is dead, clear the locks:  
   ```
   sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
   sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
   sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
   ```  
   - These are safe to delete if no APT processes are running.

4. **Update Package Lists**  
   Refresh the cache:  
   ```
   sudo dpkg --configure -a
   sudo apt update
   ```

5. **Resume or Rerun Your Command**  
   - To resume the suspended job: `fg` (brings back job [1]).  
   - Or just rerun: `sudo apt --fix-broken install`.  
   If it still fails, try `sudo apt install -f` (same as `--fix-broken`).

### Prevention Tips
- Avoid running multiple APT commands simultaneously.  
- If using a GUI updater, close it before CLI operations.  
- For persistent issues, check disk space (`df -h`) or logs (`sudo journalctl -u apt`).

If this doesn't resolve it or you see errors, paste the output of step 1 for more help.
