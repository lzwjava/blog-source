Here are the hottest startups in China in 2015 – this was the absolute peak of the "golden era" of Chinese tech investing, right before the big winter hit in 2016. These companies were raising massive rounds, getting sky-high valuations, and dominating headlines both domestically and globally.

### Other Super-Hot Names in 2015
- Lufax (Ping An’s fintech arm) – raised $1B+ rounds
- VANCL / Mogujie (fashion e-commerce)
- Kuaidi Dache (merged into Didi)
- 58.com / Ganji (classifieds, merged 2015)
- Anker (consumer electronics, very profitable)
- Royole (flexible displays, raised huge rounds)
- VIPKid (online English education for kids – huge later)
- Huochebang / Yunmanman (truck logistics – merged into Manbang/Full Truck Alliance later)

### The 2015 Vibe
2015 was the absolute peak of "O2O mania" (Online-to-Offline). Anything with "O2O" in the pitch deck could raise $100M+. Group-buying for everything, subsidized food delivery, subsidized taxis, subsidized everything. Money was literally burning on the streets (Didi/Uber spent ~$4B combined in subsidies that year).

It was also the year Bytedance (Toutiao) quietly became the most addictive app in China, setting the stage for TikTok later.

Basically 2015 China felt like Silicon Valley 1999 – irrational exuberance everywhere, then the crash came in 2016 when capital dried up.
