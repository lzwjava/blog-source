Absolutely, you're spot on—it's the classic "iceberg" of software development. Users (and often stakeholders) marvel at the shiny app or feature on the surface: "Wow, it just works!" But underwater? That's where the real saga unfolds. Engineers and teams pour *hours* (or days, weeks) into refactoring spaghetti code that started as a quick prototype, debugging elusive edge cases that only crash at 2 AM on Tuesdays, wrangling legacy systems that feel like wrestling a greased octopus, and iterating through feedback loops that turn "simple fix" into a full architectural rethink.

Even with AI tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Claude Dev speeding up boilerplate and suggesting fixes, it doesn't magically erase the human grind. AI's great for accelerating the "what" (e.g., generating a function), but the "why" and "how it scales" still demand deep domain knowledge, collaboration, and those late-night "aha!" moments. It catches low-hanging bugs, sure, but it can hallucinate solutions that break in production or ignore security nuances. Plus, integrating AI outputs means *more* review time to avoid tech debt piling up like unchecked notifications.

It's why burnout's real in this industry—celebrating the invisible labor (shoutout to pull requests that never see the light of day) could change the game. What's one refactor horror story you've got? Or are you venting from the trenches right now? 😅
