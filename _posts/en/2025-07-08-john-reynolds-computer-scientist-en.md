John Charles Reynolds (1935-2013) was a highly influential American computer scientist, renowned for his fundamental contributions to the theory of programming languages.

Reynolds' academic journey began with studies at Purdue University, followed by a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Harvard University in 1961. His passion for computer science grew during his time at Argonne National Laboratory (1961-1970). He then served as a professor of information science at Syracuse University from 1970 to 1986, before joining Carnegie Mellon University as a professor of computer science, where he remained until his passing. He also held visiting positions at several prestigious institutions globally.

His main research interests focused on programming language design, formal semantics, and associated specification languages. His key contributions include:

* **Polymorphic Lambda Calculus (System F):** He independently invented this calculus and formulated the property of semantic parametricity, which describes how polymorphic functions treat types uniformly.
* **Definitional Interpreters and Defunctionalization:** He wrote a seminal paper that clarified early work on continuations and introduced the technique of defunctionalization.
* **Programming Language Design:** He defined the programming languages Gedanken and Forsythe, notable for their use of intersection types. He also created an elegant, idealized formulation of the ALGOL programming language, which became a significant object of semantic research.
* **Separation Logic:** In his later career, he co-developed separation logic, a powerful framework for reasoning about programs that manipulate shared mutable data structures, especially useful for concurrent programming. This work has had a significant impact on automated program analysis.
* **Logical Foundations of Programs:** Throughout his career, Reynolds was deeply invested in applying mathematical tools, including category theory and logical relations, to formally define programming language semantics and prove program correctness.

Reynolds' significant impact on computer science was recognized through numerous awards, including being appointed a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 2001, receiving the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Language Achievement Award in 2003, and the Lovelace Medal from the British Computer Society in 2010. He also authored influential textbooks such as "The Craft of Programming" (1981) and "Theories of Programming Languages" (1998).
