title: PEP 517 Python Packaging Guide
translated: false
type: note
---

PEP 517, accepted in 2016, defines a standardized interface for building Python packages that decouples the build backend (the logic for creating distributions) from the frontend (tools like pip that orchestrate the process). This allows developers to use modern build tools without being locked into legacy systems like setuptools' `setup.py`. Combined with PEP 518 (which specifies build dependencies), it enables reliable, isolated builds from source trees or source distributions (sdists). As of 2025, PEP 517 is the foundation for modern Python packaging, supported by pip (since version 10 for PEP 518 and 19 for full PEP 517) and tools like Poetry, Flit, and PDM.

This guide covers the motivation, key concepts, specification, workflows, implementation, and best practices.

## Motivation and Background

Python packaging evolved from `distutils` (introduced in Python 1.6, 2000) to `setuptools` (2004), which added dependency management but introduced issues:
- **Imperative and Fragile**: Builds relied on executing `python setup.py`, an arbitrary script that could fail due to environment assumptions (e.g., missing Cython for extensions).
- **No Build Dependencies**: Tools needed for building (e.g., compilers, Cython) weren't declared, leading to manual installations and version conflicts.
- **Tight Coupling**: Pip hardcoded `setup.py` invocation, blocking alternative build systems like Flit or Bento.
- **Host Environment Pollution**: Builds used the user's global Python environment, risking side effects.

These problems stifled innovation and caused errors during source installs (e.g., from Git). PEP 517 solves this by standardizing a minimal interface: frontends call backend hooks in isolated environments. Wheels (pre-built binaries, introduced 2014) simplify distribution—backends just produce compliant wheels/sdists. PEP 518 complements by declaring build requirements in `pyproject.toml`, enabling isolation.

The result: A declarative, extensible ecosystem where `setup.py` is optional, and tools like pip can build any compliant project without legacy fallbacks.

## Key Concepts

### Source Trees and Distributions
- **Source Tree**: A directory (e.g., VCS checkout) containing package code and `pyproject.toml`. Tools like `pip install .` build from it.
- **Source Distribution (Sdist)**: A gzipped tarball (`.tar.gz`) like `package-1.0.tar.gz`, unpacking to a `{name}-{version}` directory with `pyproject.toml` and metadata (PKG-INFO). Used for releases and downstream packaging (e.g., Debian).
- **Wheel**: A `.whl` binary distribution—pre-built, platform-specific, and installable without compilation. PEP 517 mandates wheels for reproducibility.

Legacy sdists (pre-PEP 517) unpack to executable trees but must now include `pyproject.toml` for compliance.

### pyproject.toml
This TOML file centralizes configuration. The `[build-system]` section (from PEP 518/517) specifies:
- `requires`: List of PEP 508 dependencies for the build (e.g., `["setuptools>=40.8.0", "wheel"]`).
- `build-backend`: Entry point to the backend (e.g., `"setuptools.build_meta"` or `"poetry.masonry.api"`).
- `backend-path` (optional): In-tree paths added to `sys.path` for self-hosted backends (e.g., `["src/backend"]`).

Example minimal config:
```
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=40.8.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

Requirements form a DAG (no cycles; frontends detect and fail). Other sections like `[project]` (PEP 621) or `[tool.poetry]` hold metadata/dependencies.

### Build Backends and Frontends
- **Backend**: Implements build logic via hooks (callable functions). Runs in a subprocess for isolation.
- **Frontend**: Orchestrates (e.g., pip). Sets up isolation, installs requirements, calls hooks.
- **Decoupling**: Frontends invoke standardized hooks, not `setup.py`. This supports diverse backends without pip changes.

Hooks use `config_settings` (dict for flags, e.g., `{"--debug": true}`) and may output to stdout/stderr (UTF-8).

## The Specification

### [build-system] Details
- `requires`: PEP 508 strings (e.g., `">=1.0; sys_platform == 'win32'"`).
- `build-backend`: `module:object` (e.g., `flit_core.buildapi` imports `flit_core; backend = flit_core.buildapi`).
- No sys.path pollution—backends import via isolation.

### Hooks
Backends expose these as attributes:

**Mandatory:**
- `build_wheel(wheel_directory, config_settings=None, metadata_directory=None) -> str`: Builds wheel in `wheel_directory`, returns basename (e.g., `"myproj-1.0-py3-none-any.whl"`). Uses prior metadata if provided. Handles read-only sources via temps.
- `build_sdist(sdist_directory, config_settings=None) -> str`: Builds sdist in `sdist_directory` (pax format, UTF-8). Raises `UnsupportedOperation` if impossible (e.g., no VCS).

**Optional (defaults to `[]` or fallbacks):**
- `get_requires_for_build_wheel(config_settings=None) -> list[str]`: Extra wheel deps (e.g., `["cython"]`).
- `prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel(metadata_directory, config_settings=None) -> str`: Writes `{pkg}-{ver}.dist-info` metadata (per wheel spec, no RECORD). Returns basename; frontends extract from wheel if missing.
- `get_requires_for_build_sdist(config_settings=None) -> list[str]`: Extra sdist deps.

Hooks raise exceptions for errors. Frontends call in isolated envs (e.g., venv with only stdlib + requirements).

### Build Environment
- Isolated venv: Bootstrap for `get_requires_*`, full for builds.
- CLI tools (e.g., `flit`) in PATH.
- No stdin; subprocesses per hook.

## How the Build Process Works

### Step-by-Step Workflow
For `pip install .` (source tree) or sdist install:

1. **Discovery**: Frontend reads `pyproject.toml`.
2. **Isolation Setup**: Create venv; install `requires`.
3. **Requirements Query**: Call `get_requires_for_build_wheel` (install extras).
4. **Metadata Prep**: Call `prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel` (or build wheel and extract).
5. **Wheel Build**: Call `build_wheel` in isolated env; install resulting wheel.
6. **Fallbacks**: If sdist unsupported, build wheel; if no hooks, legacy `setup.py`.

For sdists: Unpack, treat as source tree. Developer workflow (e.g., `pip wheel .`):
1. Isolate env.
2. Call backend hooks for wheel/sdist.

### Build Isolation (PEP 518)
Creates temp venv for builds, avoiding host pollution. Pip's `--no-build-isolation` disables (use cautiously). Tools like tox default to isolation.

Old vs. New:
- **Old**: `python setup.py install` in host env—risks conflicts.
- **New**: Isolated hooks—reproducible, secure.

## Implementing a Build Backend

To create one:
1. Define a module with hooks (e.g., `mybackend.py`).
2. Point `build-backend` to it.

Minimal example (pure Python package):
```python
# mybackend.py
from zipfile import ZipFile
import os
from pathlib import Path

def build_wheel(wheel_directory, config_settings=None, metadata_directory=None):
    # Copy source to wheel dir, zip as .whl
    dist = Path(wheel_directory) / "myproj-1.0-py3-none-any.whl"
    with ZipFile(dist, 'w') as z:
        for src in Path('.').rglob('*'):
            z.write(src, src.relative_to('.'))
    return str(dist.relative_to(wheel_directory))

# Optional hooks
def get_requires_for_build_wheel(config_settings=None):
    return []

def prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel(metadata_directory, config_settings=None):
    # Write METADATA, etc.
    return "myproj-1.0.dist-info"
```

In `pyproject.toml`:
```
[build-system]
requires = []
build-backend = "mybackend:build_wheel"  # Actually points to module object
```

Use libraries like `pyproject-hooks` for boilerplate. For extensions, integrate C compilers via `config_settings`.

## Using PEP 517 with Tools

- **pip**: Auto-detects `pyproject.toml`; use `--use-pep517` (default since 19.1). For editable: `pip install -e .` calls hooks.
- **Poetry**: Declarative tool. Generates:
  ```
  [build-system]
  requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
  build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
  ```
  Installs via `poetry build`; pip-compatible.
- **Flit**: Simple for pure Python. Uses:
  ```
  [build-system]
  requires = ["flit_core >=3.2,<4"]
  build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"
  ```
  `flit publish` builds/uploads.
- **Setuptools**: Legacy bridge:
  ```
  [build-system]
  requires = ["setuptools>=40.8.0", "wheel"]
  build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
  ```
  Supports `setup.cfg` for declarative metadata.

Migrate legacy: Add `[build-system]`; remove `setup.py` calls.

## Error Handling and Best Practices

- **Errors**: Hooks raise (e.g., `ValueError` for invalid config). Cycles: Frontend fails with message. Unsupported sdist: Fallback to wheel.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Prefer declarative (`setup.cfg` or `[project]`).
  - Declare exact build deps (e.g., `cython==0.29`).
  - Test isolation: `pip wheel . --no-build-isolation` for debugging.
  - For in-tree backends: Use `backend-path`; avoid cycles.
  - Security: Hooks in subprocesses; no arbitrary code.
  - Compatibility: Include `setup.py` for old tools.

As of 2025, setuptools dominates (per surveys), but adoption of Poetry/Flit grows for simplicity.
