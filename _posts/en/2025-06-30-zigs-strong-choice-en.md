Zig is gaining traction for its focus on performance, memory safety, and C interoperability, making it a strong choice for low-level systems programming. While it's still a relatively young language compared to giants like C++ or Rust, several notable open-source projects are leveraging Zig:

Here are some famous Zig open-source projects, including the ones you mentioned:

* **Bun**: This is a very popular, fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler, and package manager. It uses Zig for its highly performant core, which is a major reason for its speed and efficiency. It's often cited as one of the largest projects using Zig.
* **Ghostty**: A modern, cross-platform terminal emulator written in Zig. It aims to be fast and feature-rich, providing a powerful alternative to existing terminal emulators. While not publicly available for direct contribution yet, it's highly anticipated and a strong showcase of Zig's capabilities in building native applications.
* **TigerBeetle**: A financial transactions database designed for mission-critical safety and performance. Its entire core is written in Zig, emphasizing the language's suitability for high-assurance, high-performance systems.
* **Mach**: A Zig game engine and graphics toolkit. It's a significant project that aims to provide a robust and cross-platform solution for game development and other graphics-intensive applications, built entirely in Zig.
* **Ollama-zig / llama2.zig**: There are several projects focused on large language model (LLM) inference in Zig. These aim to run models like Llama 2 efficiently in pure Zig, demonstrating the language's potential for AI and machine learning at a low level.
* **River**: A dynamic tiling Wayland compositor. It showcases Zig's use in building desktop environment components, specifically a Wayland compositor.
* **Lightpanda**: A headless browser designed for AI and automation. This is another example of a complex application being built with Zig, highlighting its use in areas requiring high performance and control.
* **Capy**: A cross-platform library for building native UIs. This project aims to allow developers to write one codebase and get native UI on Windows, Linux, and Web, demonstrating Zig's potential for cross-platform GUI development.

Beyond these larger projects, the Zig ecosystem is growing with many smaller, specialized libraries and tools for various purposes, including:

* **Networking**: WebSocket implementations, HTTP parsers, and frameworks for web services.
* **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Libraries for common data structures, serialization formats (like Protobuf, TOML, JSON parsers), and search algorithms.
* **Utilities**: Terminal file explorers, dotenv parsers, ZFS snapshot tools, and `ls` alternatives.
* **System Programming**: Allocators, memory management tools, and libraries for interacting with OS-native features.
* **Game Development**: Various game clones (Tetris, Snake), linear algebra libraries, and game engine components.

The "Awesome Zig" GitHub repository is an excellent resource for discovering more open-source projects and libraries in the Zig community. As Zig continues to mature, we can expect to see even more innovative and impactful projects emerge.
