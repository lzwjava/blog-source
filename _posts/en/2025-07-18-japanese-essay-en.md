title: First Japanese Composition
translated: true

I'm happy to have written my first Japanese composition. Most of this composition was written by AI, but it wasn't translated from English to Japanese. Instead, I wrote each sentence in Japanese and used the `command+k` shortcut in VS Code with Gemini 2.5 Flash's correction command to refine it.

This approach helps me become more aware of the appearance of Japanese characters.

This method helps me become more conscious of the appearance of Japanese characters. It also allows me to learn more when editing AI-generated text.

I spent about an hour modifying this content with AI assistance. I hope it works out.

As shown below, Japanese text is displayed on the blog's front page, but it should actually be displayed in English. Additionally, the translation flag is not marked as "translated" because I originally wrote the essay in Japanese. Essays in other languages should be translated.
