39. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: AI trading systems face oversight to ensure transparency and fairness.
40. **Integration with Algo Trading**: AI enhances algorithmic trading by adding predictive capabilities.

## Quantitative Trading
41. **Definition**: Quantitative trading uses mathematical models and statistical techniques to identify trading opportunities.
42. **Quantitative Analysts (Quants)**: Professionals with expertise in math, statistics, and programming develop trading strategies.
43. **Statistical Arbitrage**: Exploits short-term mispricings using statistical models.
44. **Mean Reversion**: Assumes prices will revert to their historical mean, guiding trade decisions.
45. **Momentum Trading**: Capitalizes on trends where prices continue moving in the same direction.
46. **Factor Models**: Use factors like value, size, or volatility to predict asset returns.
47. **Risk Models**: Quantify portfolio risk using metrics like Value at Risk (VaR) or Conditional VaR.
48. **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyzes historical price data to forecast future movements.
49. **Cross-Sectional Analysis**: Compares assets across a market to identify relative value.
