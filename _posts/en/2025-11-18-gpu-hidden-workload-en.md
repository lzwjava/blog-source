title: Your GPU's Hidden Daily Workload
translated: false
type: note

Yes, modern computers (especially with NVIDIA/AMD/Intel GPUs) use GPU acceleration for a lot of everyday tasks — not just gaming or 3D. The GPU is automatically used in most cases without you doing anything special.

Here are the most common daily-use scenarios where your GPU is heavily working (often without you noticing):

| Category                  | Examples (what you do daily)                                      | How the GPU helps                                      |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Video playback & streaming| YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, Spotify video, local 4K/8K MKV files   | Hardware decoding (AV1, H.265/HEVC, H.264) → plays smoothly, low CPU usage, lower power/heat |
| Video calls               | Zoom, Teams, Discord, FaceTime, WhatsApp                          | Background blur, face tracking, noise removal, encoding the camera stream |
| Web browsing              | Scrolling on Reddit/Twitter/X, Netflix in browser, Google Maps 3D, modern websites with animations | WebGL, hardware-accelerated CSS, canvas, video in browser |
| Image viewing & editing   | Windows Photos app, macOS Preview, Lightroom, Photoshop Express, Snapseed on phone | Fast zooming, filters, auto-enhance, face detection    |
| ZIP / RAR compression     | Compressing or extracting large folders (WinRAR, 7-Zip, Windows built-in)| Newer versions (7-Zip 24+, WinRAR 7+, PeaZip) can use NVIDIA CUDA or OpenCL for much faster compression |
| Office & PDF              | Scrolling long PDFs, PowerPoint animations, Excel with lots of rows, Google Docs | Smooth scrolling, hardware rendering of text and graphics |
| Emoji & fonts             | Typing 😂🤌 in any app or browser                                  | Emoji are rendered with GPU (especially color emojis on Windows/macOS) |
| Screen recording          | OBS, Xbox Game Bar, QuickTime, NVIDIA ShadowPlay                 | GPU encodes the video in real time (NVENC/AMD VCN/Intel QuickSync) |
| AI features (2024–2025)   | Windows Copilot+, Photoshop Generative Fill, ChatGPT image generation in browser, Apple Intelligence, local Stable Diffusion | Runs on GPU (NVIDIA especially fast)                   |
| Phone & tablet (same idea)| Instagram/TikTok scrolling, camera effects, face unlock          | Almost everything is GPU-accelerated on mobile too     |
| Upscaling video           | Watching 1080p YouTube on a 4K screen, Netflix “Enhanced” mode    | DLSS/FSR-like real-time upscaling in Chrome/Edge with RTX cards |
| Browser games & WebApps   | Canva, Figma, Photoshop on the web, Google Earth                 | Everything is rendered with WebGL/WebGPU                |

### Bonus: Things you probably didn’t realize use the GPU a lot
- Windows 11 / macOS animations (blur, acrylic, window snapping)
- Multiple 4K/8K monitors (just driving the pixels needs GPU power)
- Antivirus full scans (some like Windows Defender use GPU for ML-based detection now)
- Password managers that generate site icons (favicon rendering)
- Discord nitro animated avatars and emojis

Basically, in 2025, if your computer feels “snappy” when scrolling websites, playing 4K YouTube at 0.5× speed without stuttering, or using AI tools locally, it’s almost certainly the GPU doing the heavy lifting — not the CPU.

So yes, ZIP can be GPU-accelerated today (with the right software), video playback definitely is, and almost every visual thing you do daily quietly uses the GPU.
