The self-study course book for **04729 College Chinese** (*大学语文*), generally the **2018 edition** published by **Peking University Press** and edited by **Xu Zhongyu** and **Tao Xingchuan**, contains a selection of **classic and acclaimed essays, poems, and prose from ancient, modern, and foreign literature** (primarily Chinese).

While I cannot list every single essay, the textbook's content is characterized by the following features:

* **Diverse Literary Forms:** It includes a variety of genres like **essays (散文)**, **prose**, **poetry (诗歌)**, **classical Chinese (文言文)**, and excerpts of literary works.
* **Focus on Literary Appreciation:** The core goal is to guide students through reading, analyzing, and appreciating renowned masterpieces to improve their **literary and aesthetic sensibilities**.
* **Emphasis on Writing Skills:** The readings serve as models (**典型示范**) to inspire and enhance the student's **writing and expressive abilities**.
* **Historical and Thematic Breadth:** The selections cover different periods—from pre-modern to contemporary—and explore various humanistic themes to cultivate students' **humanistic spirit and cultural literacy**.

In short, the essays and texts are carefully chosen **masterpieces** (*美文*, *脍炙人口的名篇*) of Chinese literature and translation, intended to serve as the foundation for higher-level reading and writing skills.

Would you like me to try and find a more detailed table of contents or information on a specific era (e.g., Classical Chinese or Modern Essays) covered in the book?
