### Dispersion: An Overview

"Dispersion" refers to the act or process of spreading out or scattering something, but its specific meaning varies by field. Below are the most common definitions.

#### In Statistics and Data Analysis
Dispersion measures how spread out or scattered a set of data values is around a central value (like the mean). High dispersion indicates values are widely varied, while low dispersion means they're clustered closely. Common measures include:
- **Range**: Difference between the maximum and minimum values.
- **Variance**: Average of squared differences from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance, showing typical deviation from the mean.

For example, in a dataset of test scores {70, 75, 80}, the dispersion is low; in {50, 75, 100}, it's higher.

#### In Physics and Optics
Dispersion is the separation of white light into its component colors (spectrum) due to different wavelengths refracting at different angles, as seen in a prism or rainbow. This phenomenon occurs because the speed of light varies by wavelength in a medium.

#### In Chemistry
A dispersion is a mixture where tiny particles of one substance (dispersed phase) are evenly distributed but not dissolved in another (continuous phase), like fog (water droplets in air) or milk (fat globules in water). Unlike solutions, particles can settle over time.

#### Other Contexts
- **Biology/Ecology**: The scattering of organisms or seeds across an area.
- **Materials Science**: Mixing immiscible substances without chemical bonding.

If you meant a specific type (e.g., statistical dispersion), provide more details for a deeper dive!
