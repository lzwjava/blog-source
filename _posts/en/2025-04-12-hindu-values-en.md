Hindu values are rooted in a diverse set of scriptures (like the Vedas, Upanishads, and Bhagavad Gita), traditions, and philosophies, reflecting the religion’s complexity and lack of a single doctrine. The main values include:

- **Dharma**: Living a righteous life according to one’s duty, which varies by age, caste, gender, and stage of life (e.g., student, householder). It emphasizes ethical conduct, truth, and harmony with cosmic order (Rig Veda 10.85.1, Gita 3:35).
- **Karma**: The principle of cause and effect, where actions influence future outcomes, including rebirth. Good deeds lead to positive results, while harmful actions bring suffering (Gita 2:47, Upanishads 4.4.5).
- **Moksha**: Liberation from the cycle of birth and death (samsara), achieved through spiritual realization, self-knowledge, or devotion to God. It’s the ultimate goal in most Hindu traditions (Upanishads 2.3.1).
- **Ahimsa (Non-Violence)**: Avoiding harm to all living beings, a value popularized by figures like Mahatma Gandhi and central to Jainism’s influence on Hinduism (Mahabharata 13.115.1).
- **Bhakti (Devotion)**: Loving devotion to a personal deity (e.g., Vishnu, Shiva, Devi), expressed through worship, prayer, and surrender, especially in traditions like Vaishnavism (Gita 9:26).
- **Jnana (Knowledge)**: Pursuit of spiritual wisdom to understand the true nature of reality, particularly the unity of the self (Atman) with the universal consciousness (Brahman) (Upanishads 1.4.10).
- **Samsara**: Acceptance of life’s cyclical nature—birth, death, and rebirth—guiding one to live meaningfully while seeking liberation.
- **Satya (Truth)**: Commitment to honesty in thought, word, and action, seen as a foundation for ethical living (Yajur Veda 7.14).
- **Seva (Selfless Service)**: Serving others without expectation of reward, reflecting compassion and interconnectedness (Gita 3:19).
- **Purity (Shuddhi)**: Maintaining physical, mental, and spiritual cleanliness through rituals, diet, and disciplined living, especially in orthodox traditions.

Hinduism’s values vary across its many sects (e.g., Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism) and philosophies (e.g., Advaita Vedanta’s non-dualism vs. Dvaita’s dualism). For instance, a devotee of Krishna might prioritize bhakti, while a Vedantin emphasizes jnana. Despite this diversity, dharma, karma, and moksha are near-universal threads.
