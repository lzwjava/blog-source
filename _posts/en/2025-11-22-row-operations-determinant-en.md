That's a great question! Let's address the row operations and their effect on the determinant.

## 📐 Achieving Row Echelon Form (REF)

You are correct that **swapping rows**, **multiplying a row by a scalar**, and **adding a multiple of one row to another** are the three elementary row operations used to achieve **Row Echelon Form (REF)**.

## 🛑 Effect of Row Operations on the Determinant

Your statement that the determinant of a matrix **doesn't change** during these operations is **partially incorrect**. Only one of the three elementary row operations leaves the determinant unchanged:

### 1. Adding a Multiple of One Row to Another

* **Operation:** \\(R_i \leftarrow R_i + c R_j\\)
* **Effect on Determinant:** The determinant **DOES NOT** change.
    * If \\(\det(A) = d\\), then \\(\det(A') = d\\).
    * **Example:** \\(\det \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} = -2\\). \\(\det \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3-2(1) & 4-2(2) \end{pmatrix} = \det \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = -2\\).

### 2. Multiplying a Row by a Non-Zero Scalar

* **Operation:** \\(R_i \leftarrow c R_i\\) (where \\(c \ne 0\\))
* **Effect on Determinant:** The determinant is multiplied by the scalar \\(c\\).
    * If \\(\det(A) = d\\), then \\(\det(A') = c \cdot d\\).
    * **Example:** \\(\det \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} = -2\\). \\(\det \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3(2) & 4(2) \end{pmatrix} = \det \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 6 & 8 \end{pmatrix} = 8-12 = -4\\). Here, \\(c=2\\), and the new determinant is \\(2 \cdot (-2) = -4\\).

### 3. Swapping Two Rows

* **Operation:** \\(R_i \leftrightarrow R_j\\)
* **Effect on Determinant:** The determinant is multiplied by \\(-1\\) (it changes sign).
    * If \\(\det(A) = d\\), then \\(\det(A') = -d\\).
    * **Example:** \\(\det \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} = -2\\). \\(\det \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 4 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} = 3(2) - 4(1) = 6-4 = 2\\). Here, the sign changed from \\(-2\\) to \\(2\\).

## 💡 Summary Table

| Elementary Row Operation | Notation | Effect on Determinant |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Row Swap** | \\(R_i \leftrightarrow R_j\\) | \\(\det(A') = -\det(A)\\) |
| **Scalar Multiplication** | \\(R_i \leftarrow c R_i\\) | \\(\det(A') = c \cdot \det(A)\\) |
| **Row Addition** | \\(R_i \leftarrow R_i + c R_j\\) | \\(\det(A') = \det(A)\\) |

If you use row operations to transform a matrix \\(A\\) into its Row Echelon Form \\(U\\), you can find the original determinant by keeping track of the changes:

\\(\\)\det(A) = (-1)^s \cdot \frac{1}{c_1 c_2 \dots c_k} \cdot \det(U)\\(\\)

where \\(s\\) is the number of row swaps and \\(c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k\\) are the scalars used in row multiplications. For a matrix in REF, \\(\det(U)\\) is simply the product of its diagonal entries (since it's an upper triangular matrix).
