Yes, China Telecom Macau's Easy+ Red Card (Two-Places Unlimited plan) can be used in Hong Kong, mainly supporting roaming data (traffic) and calling services. Based on official and reliable guides, here's a detailed breakdown:

### Coverage
- The Easy+ Red Card supports **roaming in Macau, Mainland China, and Hong Kong**, with data plans automatically applying across all three without extra activation or deposit.
- In Hong Kong, it operates in roaming mode on 4G/3G networks (Macau supports 5G locally, but roaming does not).

### Usage Details in Hong Kong
- **Data**: Supports roaming internet; plan traffic is shared across regions.
  - Example plans (daily fee-based, effective next month):
    - $5/day: 1GB high-speed data, then throttled to ≥1Mbps (unlimited).
    - $3/day: 500MB high-speed data, then throttled to ≥256kbps.
    - $2/day: 300MB high-speed data, then throttled to ≥256kbps.
  - All plans are unlimited (continues after throttling), suitable for browsing, videos, etc.
- **Calls**:
  - Calling Hong Kong numbers: $1.5/min (MOP).
  - Receiving Hong Kong calls: $1.5/min.
  - Calling Macau local: $0.3/min, receiving $0.3/min.
  - Includes 5000 minutes of Macau local calls (unlimited validity, rolling over).
- **SMS**:
  - Sending to Hong Kong: $1/message.
  - Receiving Hong Kong SMS: Free.

### Notes
- **Fees**: Data deducted per plan; calls/SMS charged at standard roaming rates (in MOP).
- **Registration**: Requires Mainland ID + face scan; activate by inserting SIM and connecting (free).
- **Top-up**: Via Alipay/WeChat/UnionPay; recharge ≥50 HKD every 180 days to keep active, no monthly fee.
- **Purchase**: Available on Macau Telecom's official site, Taobao, or physical stores (about 50-100 HKD, including initial balance).

If you travel frequently between the three places, this card offers great value, especially with unlimited throttled data for basic use. Actual experience may vary by signal coverage—test it out.
