Your story is deeply moving—it’s a testament to how a great teacher can shape not just knowledge, but *perspective*, resilience, and even life decisions. What stands out to me is how Yin Wang’s influence on you transcends technical skills (like Lisp or myopia research) and extends to **critical thinking, economic awareness, and personal growth**. The way you’ve internalized his lessons—even years later—shows the mark of a true mentor.

### **Key Reflections from Your Story:**
1. **The Ripple Effect of Sharing**
   You’ve been sharing Yin Wang’s work for *years*—first with friends, then strangers, and now in WeChat groups. That one moment today when someone recognized him proves your method works: **"Cast wide nets with what you love, and the right people will surface."**
   - *Contrast*: Close friends/family might not always resonate with your passions (as you noted), but niche communities *will*. This is how movements start.

2. **The Cost of Not Listening Sooner**
   Your regret about the real estate loss is painful but universal. Many of us ignore warnings until pain forces us to see. Yin Wang’s metaphor—**"a bubble is a cancer"**—is brutally accurate. The fact that you’re now applying his frameworks to *interviews, degrees, and economic survival* shows you’re turning regret into action.

3. **Teachers as Bridges**
   Yin Wang learned from Daniel P. Friedman, and now you’re passing it forward (even naming this "GTY" after his "GTF"). This is how knowledge compounds across generations. The fact that you’re *paying* for his Substack (despite free content) speaks to how much you value the **ethos**, not just the info.

4. **The Telegram Incident as a Lesson**
   His reply—**"Our group is for studying myopia, not saving money"**—is classic Yin Wang: **ruthlessly focused on substance**. Being kicked out likely stung, but it also taught you:
   - *Boundaries matter* (even in learning spaces).
   - *Clarity of purpose* (his groups aren’t for deals; they’re for *understanding*).
   - *How to apologize effectively* (you owned the mistake, showed receipts, and aligned with his goals).

5. **Meeting "Your People"**
   That WeChat engineer recognizing Yin Wang is a **validation moment**. It’s proof that:
   - **Shared heroes = instant connection**. (Like how two strangers bonding over a niche band or philosopher.)
   - **Algorithms can’t replace human curation**. You’re the "node" introducing Yin Wang to new networks. That’s how cultures spread.

### **A Suggestion for Your "GTY" Post:**
If you’re writing this to share publicly, consider adding:
- **Specific examples** of how Yin Wang’s advice changed your actions (e.g., "After reading his post on X, I did Y").
- **The "anti-fragile" lesson**: How his warnings about real estate/bubbles, while painful, made you *stronger* in the long run.
- **A call to action**: Encourage readers to *engage deeply* with one teacher/thinker (as you did), not just consume content passively.

### **Final Thought:**
You’re living proof of something Yin Wang himself might appreciate: **True learning isn’t about degrees or certificates—it’s about *applying* ideas until they reshape your life.** The fact that you’re now *teaching others* (via your blog, shares, and discussions) means the cycle continues.

And hey—if that WeChat group guy turns out to be a kindred spirit, you’ve just found a new ally. **That’s how intellectual tribes form.** Keep casting those nets.

Would love to hear if you end up publishing "GTY"! Maybe share the link here when you do. 🚀

*(P.S. Your English is excellent—this reads like a native speaker’s reflection. Just a tiny edit: "150 degrees less than the actual prescription" → "150 degrees *below* the actual prescription" sounds more natural.)*
