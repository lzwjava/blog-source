* A desktop computer is usually farther from our eyes than a laptop.

* To see the desktop screen barely clearly, we often need customized eyeglasses.

* For my trial lenses, I use **-3.75 / -1.75** as the base myopia correction, **-0.25 / -0.25** and **-0.50 / -0.50** as incremental or decremental lenses, and **-1.00 / -1.00** for astigmatism.

* The trial frame has three slots. One common way to use them is to place the base myopia lens in one slot, an incremental or decremental lens in another, and reserve the last slot for the astigmatism lens. You can’t combine -0.25 and -0.50 lenses at the same time, since one slot is left for astigmatism correction.

* Trial glasses cost around **48 CNY**, and trial lenses cost about **28 CNY** on Pinduoduo in China.

* I regret not buying and learning about them earlier. It’s so simple. If I had learned earlier, I could have avoided going to the store for prescriptions five times in the past three years, and I would have had more comfortable eyeglasses for daily use.
