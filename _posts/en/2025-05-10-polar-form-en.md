The polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction. This is in contrast to the Cartesian coordinate system, which uses x and y coordinates to define a point.

In polar coordinates, a point is represented as \\((r, \theta)\\), where:
- \\(r\\) is the radial distance from the origin (the reference point).
- \\(\theta\\) is the angular coordinate, usually measured in radians from the positive x-axis (the reference direction).

### Examples of Polar Coordinates

1. **Simple Point:**
   - Cartesian Coordinates: \\((1, 0)\\)
   - Polar Coordinates: \\((1, 0)\\)
   - Explanation: The point is 1 unit away from the origin along the positive x-axis.

2. **Point in the Plane:**
   - Cartesian Coordinates: \\((0, 1)\\)
   - Polar Coordinates: \\((1, \frac{\pi}{2})\\)
   - Explanation: The point is 1 unit away from the origin, at an angle of \\(\frac{\pi}{2}\\) radians (90 degrees) from the positive x-axis.

3. **Point in the Second Quadrant:**
   - Cartesian Coordinates: \\((-1, 1)\\)
   - Polar Coordinates: \\((\sqrt{2}, \frac{3\pi}{4})\\)
   - Explanation: The point is \\(\sqrt{2}\\) units away from the origin, at an angle of \\(\frac{3\pi}{4}\\) radians (135 degrees) from the positive x-axis.

4. **Point in the Third Quadrant:**
   - Cartesian Coordinates: \\((-1, -1)\\)
   - Polar Coordinates: \\((\sqrt{2}, \frac{5\pi}{4})\\)
   - Explanation: The point is \\(\sqrt{2}\\) units away from the origin, at an angle of \\(\frac{5\pi}{4}\\) radians (225 degrees) from the positive x-axis.

5. **Point in the Fourth Quadrant:**
   - Cartesian Coordinates: \\((1, -1)\\)
   - Polar Coordinates: \\((\sqrt{2}, \frac{7\pi}{4})\\)
   - Explanation: The point is \\(\sqrt{2}\\) units away from the origin, at an angle of \\(\frac{7\pi}{4}\\) radians (315 degrees) from the positive x-axis.

### Conversion Between Cartesian and Polar Coordinates

- **From Cartesian to Polar:**
  \\[
  r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
  \\]
  \\[
  \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
  \\]

- **From Polar to Cartesian:**
  \\[
  x = r \cdot \cos(\theta)
  \\]
  \\[
  y = r \cdot \sin(\theta)
  \\]

Polar coordinates are particularly useful in situations involving circular symmetry, such as in physics and engineering problems involving rotation or circular motion.
