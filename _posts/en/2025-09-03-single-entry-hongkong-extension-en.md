You're asking whether, as a Chinese citizen living in Guangzhou’s Huangpu District, you can go to the exit‑entry administration office to extend a **single‑entry endorsement** on your *Two‑Way Permit* ("Exit‑Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao") and then use a machine to help you activate it so you can travel to Hong Kong for seven days. Let’s clear this up step by step:

---

### 1. Can you get a one-time (single-entry) endorsement extended?

Yes, Mainland Chinese citizens residing in Guangzhou (Huangpu) apply to the local **Exit‑Entry Administration** of the Public Security Bureau to obtain or extend entry endorsements on their Two‑Way Permit. Endorsements include single‑, double‑, and multiple‑entry options, with types such as:

* **G endorsement (individual tourism)**: Valid for 3 months or 1 year, single or double‑journey, with each visit up to 7 days ([Wikipedia][1]).

So yes, you can go to the administration office to apply for a **single‑entry G endorsement** if your permit's current endorsements are insufficient.

---

### 2. Once you have the endorsement, can you stay in Hong Kong for 7 days?

Yes. The **G endorsement** you receive allows a maximum stay of **7 days per visit**. That means with a valid single‑entry G endorsement, you may stay in Hong Kong for up to 7 days ([Wikipedia][1]).

---

### 3. Can you use a machine (self-service kiosk) to get the endorsement instantly?

Yes! In many provinces, including Guangdong, there are **automatic endorsement machines** installed at Exit‑Entry Administration offices. These allow holders of the Two‑Way Permit to obtain exit endorsements (like G, S, T) by themselves — typically scanning the permit, paying a fee, and receiving the endorsement on the spot ([Wikipedia][1]).

This streamlines the process—no need to wait in longer lines.

---

### 4. Does this match what you remember about Shenzhen’s policy?

Similar measures have been introduced specifically in Shenzhen:

* Residents (including non‑permanent ones with residence permits) can obtain **multiple‑entry permits valid for one year**, allowing unlimited visits—each up to 7 days. A self‑service machine (kiosk) can be used for this in under two minutes, with QR code payment ([Shenzhen Government][2]).

While that policy is specific to Shenzhen, Guangzhou offers a similar **automatic endorsement service** more broadly under the national system.

---

### Summary of What’s Possible (Yes):

* You **can go** to your local Exit-Entry administration office in Huangpu to extend or get a **single-entry G endorsement** on your Two-Way Permit.
* The G endorsement **entitles you** to a **7-day stay in Hong Kong**.
* **Self-service machines** are indeed available in many offices—including in Guangdong—to process endorsements quickly and conveniently.

---

### Tips for Your Visit:

* Bring your Two-Way Permit (with at least 3 months’ validity remaining).
* Visit the local Exit-Entry Administration bureau (PSB).
* Look for the **endorsement machine/self-service kiosk**.
* Select the G endorsement (single entry), scan your card, pay the fee, and receive it immediately.
* Now you can travel to Hong Kong and stay up to 7 days.
