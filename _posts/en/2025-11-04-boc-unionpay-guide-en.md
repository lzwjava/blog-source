Your BOC HK (Bank of China Hong Kong) physical debit card, which is UnionPay-branded, is a dual-currency card (typically linked to HKD and RMB accounts) designed for secure transactions via the UnionPay network. Since you've already activated overseas withdrawals through the BOCHK app (which lifts the default zero daily limit for security), it's ready for international use. Here's a breakdown of what you can use it for, based on official details:

### Key Uses
- **ATM Cash Withdrawals**:
  - Withdraw cash from over 1.7 million ATMs worldwide displaying the UnionPay logo (common in Asia, Europe, North America, and major travel spots like Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Australia, and the US).
  - Also works at BOC or JETCO network ATMs (over 3,000 in Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Macau—no activation needed for JETCO in Macau).
  - Minimum withdrawal: HK$300 at JETCO ATMs.
  - Daily limit: Set by you via the app (default POS/transfer limit is HKD/RMB 50,000, adjustable down to zero; ATM limit is separate and now active per your setup).
  - **Fee**: HK$50 per transaction from your HKD account (or RMB 50 from RMB account) for overseas UnionPay ATMs. Local ATM operator surcharges may apply. Currency conversion uses UnionPay's rates (no extra bank forex fee).

- **POS (Point-of-Sale) Payments**:
  - Pay at over 16 million merchants globally accepting UnionPay (look for the logo—widespread in China, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and growing elsewhere; accepted at ~95% of POS in Australia, 90%+ in many European countries).
  - Supports contactless "tap-and-go" payments via UnionPay QuickPass (tap the card at readers with the QuickPass logo in Hong Kong or overseas, then enter PIN—no insertion needed).
  - In Mainland China: Transactions auto-settle in RMB (from your RMB account) to avoid conversion fees; elsewhere (HK/overseas), settles in HKD.
  - Daily limit: HKD/RMB 50,000 (shared with transfers; adjustable via app).
  - **Fee**: None from BOCHK for POS/online purchases. Currency conversion at UnionPay rates if needed.

- **Other Features**:
  - **Online Payments**: Use where UnionPay is supported (e.g., bind to UnionPay App for QR code payments or e-commerce in China/HK/Macau).
  - **Funds Transfer**: Between linked accounts or to other banks (within daily limit).
  - **Dual-Currency Perk**: Saves on forex—use RMB account seamlessly in China without conversion.
  - Not ideal for everywhere (e.g., some US merchants prefer Visa/Mastercard), but great for Asia-focused travel. Always carry a backup card.

### Tips
- Check acceptance: Use the UnionPay app or website to locate nearby ATMs/POS.
- Security: Monitor via BOCHK app; report issues to +852 2691 2323.
- If your card has both HKD/RMB accounts, enable Auto-Transfer in the app for seamless debits.
