title: Fixing NVIDIA Driver Loading Issues

### Understanding the Error
This error indicates that the NVIDIA kernel driver (the low-level part that interfaces with your GPU) isn't loaded or isn't compatible with your current setup. It's different from a version mismatch—here, `nvidia-smi` (a user-space tool) can't even reach the driver. Common triggers include:
- Driver not installed.
- Kernel update without rebuilding driver modules.
- Conflicts with the open-source Nouveau driver.
- Secure Boot blocking unsigned modules.
- Incomplete installation.

This is common on Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, Mint) after updates. We'll troubleshoot and fix it step-by-step. Run commands as your user unless `sudo` is specified. Assume Ubuntu/Debian-like distro (adjust for others like Fedora with `dnf`).

### Step 1: Basic Diagnostics
Run these to pinpoint the issue:

```
# Check if NVIDIA kernel modules are loaded
lsmod | grep nvidia

# Check driver version (if loaded)
cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version

# Look for errors in kernel logs
dmesg | grep -i nvidia
```

- **If `lsmod` shows no output**: Driver not loaded—proceed to install/rebuild.
- **If `dmesg` mentions "Nouveau" or "failed to load"**: Nouveau conflict—skip to Step 3.
- **If version shows but mismatch**: Reboot first (`sudo reboot`), then retry `nvidia-smi`.

Share outputs if needed for more tailored advice.

### Step 2: Quick Fixes (Try These First)
1. **Reboot**: Simple but effective after kernel/driver changes.  
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```
   Then: `nvidia-smi`.

2. **Reload Modules** (if partially loaded):  
   ```
   sudo modprobe nvidia
   nvidia-smi  # Test
   ```
   If it fails with "module not found," install the driver (Step 4).

3. **Check Kernel Mismatch**: If you recently updated your kernel, boot into the previous one via GRUB (hold Shift during boot, select older kernel). Reinstall driver afterward.

### Step 3: Disable Nouveau (If Conflicting)
Nouveau (default open-source driver) often blocks NVIDIA's proprietary one. Blacklist it permanently:

1. Create blacklist file:  
   ```
   echo 'blacklist nouveau' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf
   echo 'options nouveau modeset=0' | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf
   ```

2. Update initramfs:  
   ```
   sudo update-initramfs -u
   ```

3. Reboot:  
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```

### Step 4: Install/Reinstall Latest NVIDIA Driver
As of October 2025, the latest stable Linux driver is version 580.95 (recommended for most GPUs; check [NVIDIA's site](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) for your model). Use Ubuntu's tools for easy DKMS integration (auto-rebuilds on kernel updates).

#### For Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian:
1. **Add Graphics Drivers PPA** (for latest versions):  
   ```
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Auto-Detect and Install**:  
   ```
   sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall  # Installs recommended (likely 580.x)
   ```
   Or specify: `sudo apt install nvidia-driver-580` (includes DKMS for stability).

3. **If Secure Boot is Enabled** (check in BIOS):  
   - Disable it temporarily (easier), or enroll NVIDIA's MOK key during install (it'll prompt on reboot).

4. **Reboot and Verify**:  
   ```
   sudo reboot
   nvidia-smi  # Should show GPU table
   ```

#### Alternative: Manual Install (If PPA Fails)
1. Download runfile from [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/227xxx/en-us/?driverType=linux) (select Linux 64-bit, 580.95).
2. Stop display manager: `sudo systemctl stop gdm` (or lightdm/sddm), then `sudo telinit 3`.
3. Install: `sudo bash NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-580.95.xx.run` (accept prompts).
4. Reboot.

#### For Other Distros:
- **Fedora/RHEL**: `sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia` (uses 580.x).
- **Arch**: `sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-dkms`.

### Step 5: Post-Install Checks
- **CUDA Setup** (for nanoGPT/ML): After driver, install CUDA toolkit: `sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit`.
- **Test**: Run `nvidia-smi`—expect a table with GPU utilization, memory, etc.
- **If Still Fails**:
  - Purge everything: `sudo apt purge 'nvidia*'; sudo apt autoremove; reboot; reinstall`.
  - Check logs: `journalctl -b -u gdm | grep nvidia` (for display issues).

This should get you running. If you're on a specific distro/GPU or see errors in diagnostics, reply with details!
