The development of the Gemini models, including versions 2.0 and 3.0, is a massive, company-wide effort led by **Google DeepMind**.

While the effort involves hundreds of researchers and engineers, the most prominent figures often cited in connection with the overall vision and leadership of the project are:

### 🌟 Key Leaders

* **Demis Hassabis:** CEO of Google DeepMind, who has consistently championed the Gemini project and positioned it as a flagship effort for the company.
* **Sundar Pichai:** CEO of Google and Alphabet, who oversees the strategic direction and rollout of Gemini across Google's products.
* **Sergey Brin:** Google co-founder, who came out of retirement to assist in the early development of Gemini and is credited as a **"core contributor"**.

### 🧠 Lead Scientists and Architects

For the technical and architectural development of the models, the following individuals are frequently highlighted, often sharing responsibility for the core research:

* **Oriol Vinyals:** A key researcher and **Gemini Co-lead** at Google DeepMind. He has publicly discussed the architectural advances and training improvements (both pre-training and post-training) that led to the significant jumps in performance for Gemini 2.0 and 3.0.
* **Quoc Le:** A distinguished Google AI scientist known for his pioneering work in machine learning, particularly with the Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model. He has been cited by Oriol Vinyals as part of the research leadership discussing the scaling potential that underpins the power of models like Gemini 3.0.

* **Koray Kavukcuoglu:** CTO of Google DeepMind and Chief AI Architect, who is also mentioned alongside Pichai and Hassabis as a core leader.

The Gemini project's sheer scale means it is the work of a vast team. Major advancements like native multimodality, advanced agentic capabilities, and long-context windows in versions 2.0 and 3.0 are the result of collective breakthroughs from the merged talent of the former Google Brain and DeepMind teams now operating under the Google DeepMind umbrella.
