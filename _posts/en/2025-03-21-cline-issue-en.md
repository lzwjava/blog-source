title: Cline Extension Issue in Visual Studio Code

It seems you're encountering issues with the Cline extension in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) where it fails to detect newly created files and doesn't recognize `@mention` functionality. Based on the context of Cline as an AI-powered coding assistant, here’s how you can troubleshoot and potentially resolve these problems:

---

### 1. Cline Couldn't Detect Newly Created File
Cline might not be detecting a newly created file due to delays in workspace indexing, permission issues, or a bug in the extension’s file-watching mechanism. Here’s how to fix it:

#### Steps to Troubleshoot:
- **Refresh the Workspace**: After creating a new file, manually refresh VSCode’s workspace to ensure Cline picks it up.
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the Command Palette.
  - Type `Reload Window` and select it. This reloads VSCode and forces Cline to re-index the workspace.
  
- **Check File Creation Method**: If you’re creating files outside VSCode (e.g., via terminal or another editor), VSCode’s file watcher might not immediately detect them.
  - Try creating the file directly in VSCode (right-click in Explorer > New File) and see if Cline recognizes it.
  - If using an external tool, ensure the file is saved in the workspace directory Cline is monitoring.

- **Verify Permissions**: Cline requires read/write permissions to interact with files.
  - Open Cline’s settings in VSCode (via the Extensions sidebar or Command Palette: `Cline: Open Settings`).
  - Ensure you’ve granted it permission to read and modify files. If prompted during a task, approve the action.

- **Check Workspace Snapshot**: Cline takes snapshots of your workspace to track changes. If it’s not updating:
  - Start a new task in Cline (click the "+" button in the Cline tab) and see if it detects the file after re-analyzing the workspace.
  - Alternatively, use the `Restore` or `Compare` buttons in Cline to force a workspace refresh.

- **Update Cline and VSCode**: Ensure you’re using the latest versions, as bugs related to file detection might have been fixed.
  - Update VSCode: `Help > Check for Updates`.
  - Update Cline: Go to Extensions in VSCode, find Cline, and click the update button if available.

- **Debug via Logs**: Check Cline’s logs for errors.
  - Open the Output panel in VSCode (`Ctrl+Shift+U` or `Cmd+Shift+U`).
  - Select “Cline” from the dropdown to view its logs. Look for messages about file detection failures and address any specific issues mentioned (e.g., path errors).

#### Possible Cause:
Cline relies on VSCode’s file system APIs to detect changes. If the file isn’t indexed or the watcher is delayed, Cline won’t see it until the workspace updates.

### 2. Cline Couldn’t Use @mention
The `@mention` syntax in Cline is typically used to invoke specific tools or features (e.g., `@url` to fetch a webpage or `@problems` to address workspace errors). If it’s not working, it could be due to misconfiguration, an unsupported model, or a syntax misunderstanding.

#### Steps to Troubleshoot:
- **Verify Syntax**: Ensure you’re using the correct `@mention` syntax.
  - Examples from Cline’s documentation:
    - `@url`: Fetches a URL and converts it to markdown.
    - `@problems`: Includes workspace errors/warnings for Cline to fix.
  - Type the `@mention` in the task input field exactly as documented (case-sensitive). For instance, `@Url` or `@URL` might not work if it expects `@url`.

- **Check Model Support**: Not all AI models Cline supports can handle `@mention` functionality. Claude 3.5 Sonnet (recommended by Cline) supports agentic features, but others might not.
  - Open Cline’s settings and confirm your API provider and model.
  - If using OpenRouter or another provider, switch to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and test again.

- **Test with a Simple Task**: Start a new task and try a basic `@mention`:
  - Example: “Fix issues listed in @problems.”
  - If it doesn’t respond, the feature might be disabled or misconfigured.

- **Enable Tool Extensions**: Some `@mentions` (e.g., custom tools like `@jira` or `@aws`) require a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
  - Check if the `@mention` you’re using corresponds to a custom tool. If so:
    - Ask Cline to “add a tool” (e.g., “add a tool that fetches Jira tickets”) and follow its prompts to set it up.
    - Restart VSCode after adding the tool to ensure it’s registered.

- **Inspect API Key**: If `@mention` involves external requests (e.g., `@url`), your API key might lack sufficient permissions or credits.
  - Verify your API key in Cline’s settings (e.g., Anthropic or OpenRouter key).
  - Ensure your account has funds or access to the requested feature.

- **Report a Bug**: If the above steps fail, it might be a bug.
  - Visit Cline’s GitHub (github.com/cline/cline) and check open issues.
  - If no similar issue exists, file a new one with details: your Cline version, VSCode version, model used, and the exact `@mention` attempted.

#### Possible Cause:
The `@mention` feature might not be fully implemented for your setup, or there’s a mismatch between the model’s capabilities and the expected behavior.

### General Tips
- **Restart VSCode**: A full restart can resolve temporary glitches with extensions.
- **Reinstall Cline**: If issues persist, uninstall and reinstall the extension from the VSCode Marketplace.
- **Join Cline’s Community**: For real-time help, join their Discord (linked on their GitHub) and ask in the #support or #contributors channel.

### Example Workflow to Test Fixes
1. Create a new file in VSCode (e.g., `test.txt`).
2. Reload the window (`Ctrl+Shift+P > Reload Window`).
3. Open Cline, start a new task, and type: “Read the contents of test.txt and use @problems to list any issues.”
4. Approve any permissions and check if Cline detects the file and processes the `@mention`.

If these steps don’t resolve the issue, let me know your specific setup (Cline version, model, and what `@mention` you’re trying), and I’ll dig deeper!
