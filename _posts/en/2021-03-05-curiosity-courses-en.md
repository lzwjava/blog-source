# Curiosity Courses

Students don't need perfect teachers; they need happy teachers who can make them excited to come to school every day. I have always been interested in education. I also hope to be a good teacher. However, education is so difficult, and changing people is so difficult. Over the past few years, I have learned a lot. I learned the basics in school and a lot more after entering society. I also want to practice and improve my educational theories, so I am launching the Curiosity Courses.

Perhaps the best education is not when students ask teachers, but when teachers ask students. We think together and experiment together. In education, I have learned a lot from Wang Yin. He has also shared a lot of educational insights. I have learned a lot from him. His courses are very well-run, so I also want to be like him and offer some courses. This will allow me to learn how to impart knowledge, how to learn from students, how to rethink problems from a beginner's perspective, and how to explain knowledge in a very simple and clear way.

## Exercise Instructions

The completed course content includes instructions for exercises. Students can send them to me via WeChat private message or submit them directly by creating an issue on GitHub. The content of the exercises may be added to the course content, or an exercise review article may be written based on the submitted exercises to supplement the course.

## Public Account

The beginning of articles reprinted on the public account is as follows:

This article is part of the content of the third lesson in the programming direction of the Curiosity Courses. For real-time course content, please click the original link to visit Github@lzwjava. The third lesson uses the Python language to learn the basics of syntax, modules, object-oriented programming, and web programming. Please read this article after studying the "Unlocking Computer Science" and "Trying Out Python Programming" lessons.

## Course Plan

*   Recruit some students.
*   Free of charge.
*   There are several major directions: programming, algorithms, backend, frontend, iOS, Android, entrepreneurship, self-media, English, physics, electronics, Japanese, and information retrieval.
*   The number of class hours depends on the direction, possibly 2-20 lessons, each lesson lasting 2 hours. The duration ranges from 2 weeks to 3 months.
*   No age or occupation restrictions, beginners are especially welcome.
*   There will be homework after class.
*   Depending on the situation, students can also discuss with the teacher at other times.
*   At the same time, learning content will be accumulated, teaching videos and discussion videos will be recorded, and discussion notes will be organized.
*   Students can choose the directions they are interested in.
*   In the early stages, one student will be recruited to refine the course, and more may be recruited later.
*   Those interested can contact me via WeChat private message.

The goals for each direction are as follows. I have achieved all of these, so I am confident in trying to teach students. I am also just starting to learn some of the directions. This is good because I can better think from a beginner's perspective and grow and learn together.
