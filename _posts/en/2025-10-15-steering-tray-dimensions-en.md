Ah, got it—sorry for the mix-up on dimensions. If the 35 cm is the width (across your lap/steering wheel span) and that's feeling too wide (maybe overhanging awkwardly or clashing with your arm position after sliding the seat back), that makes sense for a snugger fit in your setup. Standard trays often hover around 38-42 cm wide, so 35 cm is actually on the narrower side for many, but if your body's wider and the seat's pushed back, it could still protrude in a way that bugs you during use.

### Quick Recalibration for Your Measurements
To dial in a better width without it feeling "too wide" (i.e., stable but not spilling over):
1. **Re-Measure Your Ideal Width**: With seat back, measure from the left edge of your left thigh/hip to the right edge of your right one, then subtract 2-3 cm for a cozy fit (so it doesn't wobble off). If that's coming in under 30 cm effective space, aim for 28-32 cm wide trays to avoid the overhang vibe.
2. **Depth Check (Assuming 76 cm is That)**: That sounds excessively long—most are 25-35 cm deep to reach your knees comfortably. If it's pushing too far forward, test with a shorter mockup (cardboard at 20-30 cm) to keep things ergonomic.

### Adjusted Size Recs
- **Narrower Fits**: Look for 30-34 cm wide x 25-30 cm deep (e.g., compact models for smaller laps or tighter cabins).
- **Why This Helps**: For bigger builds like yours, a slightly narrower width prevents side-to-side slop, especially post-seat adjustment, while keeping depth short to avoid knee bumps.

Etsy or AliExpress have adjustable ones where you can spec exact widths—search "custom steering wheel tray narrow" and message sellers your 35 cm pain point. If you snap a quick pic of your setup or share the car model, I can scout specifics.

Yeah, customization's the future fix—body-positive designs incoming, hopefully.
