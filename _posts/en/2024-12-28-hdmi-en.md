title: Connecting HDMI to Your Graphics Card
translated: false
---

When I recently moved my desktop computer from my house to my parents' house, I encountered an issue that, at first, seemed quite perplexing. I connected the HDMI cable to what appeared to be the obvious HDMI port on the back of the computer, but no matter how many times I tried, the monitor remained stubbornly blank. I initially suspected that the HDMI hub might be the culprit, so I removed it and connected the monitor directly to the computer. However, the problem persisted.

It wasn't until I took a closer look at the back of the computer that I realized my mistake: I had connected the HDMI cable to the motherboard's HDMI port instead of the one on the graphics card. Once I disconnected the cable from the motherboard and plugged it into the HDMI port on the graphics card, the monitor sprang to life, displaying everything perfectly.

Since I hadn't used this computer in almost six months, I decided to take the opportunity to update the system. I ran the following commands in the terminal to ensure that all software and libraries were up to date:

```bash
sudo snap refresh  
sudo apt upgrade  
```

This simple update process ensured that my system was running smoothly with the latest updates.
