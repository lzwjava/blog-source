- I do not need to wear slippers in the winter; wearing socks is fine.

- Separate different kinds of rubbish and consider the temperature. For kitchen waste, food scraps, or used toilet paper, I probably need to throw them out often. However, for bottles or delivery boxes, you may be able to clean them and store them for a while. In the summer, I will need to dispose of rubbish more frequently.

- Buying clothes against the trend is cheaper. Waiting half a year to wear them is not a big deal.

- Using a dryer for 10 minutes can make clothes more comfortable.

- Focus on my task and leave things where they are. It may seem unorganized to others, but it's convenient for me.

- Using an iPhone 20w charger to charge a Mac M2 is acceptable.

- In winter, wear thick cotton pants instead of thermal underwear. One pair of pants is more convenient than thermal underwear and pants.

- Always buy at least two kinds of things, like shampoo. You can use them in turn depending on your mood and easily compare them. Your hair will probably benefit from such diversity.
