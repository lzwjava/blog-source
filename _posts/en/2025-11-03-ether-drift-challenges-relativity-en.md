### Summary of the Recommendation and Claims

The user is recommending two specific papers by physicist Héctor A. Múnera (likely placeholders for "Paper 1" and "Paper 2" in the original text, possibly referring to his 2006 publications on ether-drift experiments). These papers describe experiments conducted in Múnera's laboratory from 2003 to 2005, where he and his team revisited and refined the classic Michelson-Morley (MM) experiment. The MM experiment, originally performed in 1887, aimed to detect the Earth's motion through a hypothetical "luminiferous ether" (an absolute medium for light propagation) by measuring shifts in light interference patterns (fringe shifts) in an interferometer. The null result—no detectable shift—became a cornerstone for Albert Einstein's special relativity in 1905, supporting the idea that the speed of light is constant regardless of the observer's motion.

In contrast, Múnera's work claimed to observe exactly what the original MM experiment did not: measurable fringe shifts that varied with the Earth's movement. Key findings from their two-year study include:
- **Detection of changes**: The interference fringes shifted in a way that correlated with Earth's motion through space.
- **Periodic variations**: The primary cycle was 24 hours (tied to Earth's rotation), with a secondary annual cycle (linked to Earth's orbit around the Sun).
- **Calculated absolute velocity**: By analyzing these shifts, they estimated the Earth's speed relative to an "absolute space" (implying an absolute reference frame) at around 365–400 km/s. This velocity is a composite of multiple motions: Earth's daily spin (~0.46 km/s at the equator), its orbital speed around the Sun (~30 km/s), the Sun's motion through the Milky Way (~220 km/s), and the galaxy's own drift (~370 km/s relative to the cosmic microwave background, or CMB).

These results, if valid, would undermine Einstein's second postulate of special relativity: that the speed of light in a vacuum is invariant (always ~300,000 km/s) and independent of the source or observer's motion. Instead, Múnera's data suggested the observed speed of light varies anisotropically (directionally) due to Earth's absolute motion, reviving the idea of an ether-like preferred frame.

The user notes this work dates back about 17–20 years (from the 2025 perspective, aligning with publications around 2006–2008) and questions why it's not more widely known—likely alluding to its marginal status in mainstream physics, where such claims are often dismissed due to potential experimental artifacts like thermal gradients, vibrations, or data analysis flaws.

### Broader Context and Similar Experiments
The user points out that Múnera isn't alone: Other researchers, using variations on interferometry or related optical methods, have reported similar detections of an "absolute motion" since the early 20th century. Results vary (200–500 km/s overall), but post-1970s experiments converge on 365–400 km/s, roughly matching modern astronomical estimates of our velocity relative to the CMB rest frame (about 370 km/s toward the constellation Leo).

What's intriguing, per the user, is that these setups rely purely on local lab equipment—no telescopes or sky observations needed—to infer this cosmic velocity directly. It bypasses traditional astronomy and probes space's "fabric" via light's behavior.

### The User's Personal Angle
The original MM-style interferometer is expensive and complex, so the user can't replicate Múnera's full setup. However, they've acquired basic optical gear (e.g., lasers, beam splitters, mirrors for a simple interferometer) and plan a DIY experiment to test for fringe shifts over a day or year, aiming to verify the claims on a small scale.

### Scientific Perspective
While fascinating as a challenge to orthodoxy, these findings remain controversial and unaccepted in mainstream physics. Relativists argue that apparent shifts in such experiments often stem from overlooked environmental factors (e.g., air currents, temperature fluctuations) rather than true ether drift. High-precision modern tests, like those using cryogenic resonators or atomic clocks on satellites, continue to uphold relativity's predictions. That said, the convergence of velocities toward CMB values has sparked interest in "neo-Lorentzian" interpretations, where absolute motion exists but is undetectable in local physics.
