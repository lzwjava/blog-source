## Teacher's Advice

I appreciate your cooperation! Thank you for having a wonderful and enjoyable class with me. You have the ability to speak English with confidence and competence. Keep it up and enjoy learning. I’m really glad that you gave your best when you were expressing your ideas and answering my questions. You have a very positive attitude in learning. I had a great time with you today. You are so smart and a fast learner.
Keep practicing your pronunciation and observe your accent as you speak, slow down a little when talking to avoid mispronunciation of some words. Keep expanding your English vocabulary and learning new words. The more effort you put in, the faster you'll improve. You're doing great! I look forward to seeing your continued progress. Thank you, and see you soon!

## Level

Level 8 Intermediate  

## Course Selection and Focus  

The learning method you need is "Fluent Speaking, Open Your Mouth and Practice More." During this period, you should focus on improving the fluency of your language skills, aiming to express yourself smoothly. Choosing free conversation sessions that match your level is a good option.  

## Teacher Selection  

You can select 3-5 different teachers for your studies. By experiencing each teacher’s unique language characteristics, you’ll be exposed to different expressions and can practice responding directly to what you hear—this is a must at this stage. At this point, you should work harder on "opening your mouth and practicing more."  

## Learning Method  

Through shadowing and reading aloud, gradually shift from mere reading to the level of comprehension. Strive to grasp how English vocabulary and sentence structures are expressed, and start training your English thinking. You can also ask your teachers to help correct your pronunciation and linking issues at any time. While some grammar error correction is appropriate, it shouldn’t be the main focus.
