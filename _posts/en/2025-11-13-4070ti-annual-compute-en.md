The NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti GPU has a peak FP32 performance of 40.09 TFLOPS.

Assuming continuous operation for one full non-leap year (365 days) at 90% utilization, this equates to an effective performance of approximately 36.08 TFLOPS.

The total compute delivered over that period would be about 1.14 × 10²¹ floating-point operations (FLOPs), or 1.14 zettaFLOPs.
