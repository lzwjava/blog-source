title: Understanding Eclipsed Revenues
translated: false

"Eclipsed its revenues" means that the thing that *did* the eclipsing has become **greater in amount** or **level** than the revenues.

It represents an **increase** for the eclipsing item relative to the revenues.

Think of an astronomical eclipse: one object (like the moon) covers or overshadows another (the sun), making it seem less significant.

In a financial context, it generally means:

* **Increase:** The amount of the eclipsing item (e.g., costs, expenses, or another company's sales) is **larger** than the company's revenues.

**Example 1: Expenses/Costs Eclipsing Revenue**
> "The company's marketing expenses easily **eclipsed its revenues** for the quarter."
* **Meaning:** The marketing expenses were **greater** than the revenue earned, resulting in a loss.

**Example 2: Another Company's Performance Eclipsing Revenue**
> "Our competitor's first-quarter sales **eclipsed our revenues** for the entire year."
* **Meaning:** The competitor's sales were **greater** than the company's yearly revenue, suggesting a significant lead in the market.

In short, the word **eclipsed** suggests the eclipsing item has **surpassed** or **exceeded** the revenues.
