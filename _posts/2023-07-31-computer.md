Principles:

* Compare globally, like JD.com, Rakuten Japan, Amazon USA
* Find the Best introduction to learn, check out negative comments
* Most of the store website is done poorly for the global comparing user
* Speed is often slow for some global district
      
This is what I found in the App Little Red book.      
      
Graphics Card (GPU): MSI 3080 -- 5219 CNY      
Motherboard + CPU: ASUS Z790-P + i7-13700KF -- 4349 CNY      
Solid State Drive (SSD): Western Digital 1TB -- 448 CNY      
Hard Disk Drive (HDD): Western Digital 2TB -- 338 CNY      
RAM: Kingston 16GB*2 -- 598 CNY

Learn about the different Intel Cores.

Ask ChatGPT: 

What is the difference between P-cores and E-cores in Intel CPU?

What's the difference between i9 and i7? 

If I want to do machine learning, which I should buy, the i7 or i9?

What does F mean in Intel processor?

If your Intel® Core™ Desktop Processor includes the letter F in the product line suffix, then you need to use a discrete graphics card in your system. If the integrated graphics port is used instead, the processor will not boot.

---

Is Intel K or F better?

If your Intel processor has a K, that means that it is able to be overclocked and has been unlocked. F means that there is no iGPU or integrated graphics for the processor. KF series processors tend to be cheaper than K processors and usually have no iGPU.
