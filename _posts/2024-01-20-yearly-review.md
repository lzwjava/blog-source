How to summarize my experience in 2023? Is it succesful or not? How to measure it? How I feel about it? It is a long story.

Around November 2022, I got two offers from two companies whose client is a big bank. They compete for me. One is give me around 27k CNY salary a month, another is 32k CNY salary a month. I choosed to join the second one. The previous job I took gave me the monthly salary around 22k. So I got the salary increase about 50%. I felt pretty good at the start of this year.

The new job I do is about a payment app. I helped do some backend development using Java, Spring, Spring Cloud, Azure and do some AWS migration.

I learned a lot in this journey. Let me describe about some technical lessons.

* Software architecture is very important. The microservice structure is better than monolithic application for large backend application. It is better to develop and deploy the code. How we structure the code is very important. We should think about it in the long term view. 

* Azure EventHub Kafka propeties config is important. If we do it wrong, we may lose messages when the microservices scale up.

* Sometimes, We can check the build.log of the IDEA to fix bug.

* Every line of the code matters. We can directly jump to the location of the new code to check and suspect. Like why the log here isn't printed out.

* We should do the right thing as early as possible. If something is wrong, the problem is always there and keeps making trouble to us.

* It is hard to do the right thing. We should try it for a lot of ways and let the reality tell us what is best. We can only learn some precious lessons when we stay long enough. So it is important to keep notes about our decisions and reflect on them after some time. For the code too, it is same too.
