title: "Year in Review: 2023"
---

How to summarize my experience in 2023? Is it succesful or not? How to measure it? How I feel about it? It is a long story.

Around November 2022, I got two offers from two companies whose client is a big bank. They compete for me. One is give me around 27k CNY salary a month, another is 32k CNY salary a month. I choosed to join the second one. The previous job I took gave me the monthly salary around 22k. So I got the salary increase about 50%. I felt pretty good at the start of this year.

Though I already got the salary of 25k a month in 2017, it has no much increase comparing that. I know, another 5 years passed, I grew. And comparing previous Chinese statup jobs and my startup company business, now my daily hour rate was higher than ever. My brain was sharper than ever.

And because of 3 years of COVID period, I seldom go to travel. So when coming back from Xining, my hometown, I began to travel for some places using my DJI Drone to shoot some scenarios. I went to the tower of Guangzhou and then I made a short video.

The interesting thing about that short video is that the background music rhyme of the video is matched to the lights alongside the river in some point. At that time, the rhyme changes, the lights change from on to off. 

And then about a month, every weekend I went outside, mainly around Greater Bay Area in China. Zhuhai, Dongguan, Macau, Beihai, Zhaoqing, Qingyuan. And I practiced to use DJI Drone to take arieal views. 

The most nervous moment is that when I was in Macao, when I took the scenario in a place nearby a lake. I remoted control it to fly from the above the land to above the lake.  However, the drone began to drop down. Suddenly, the distance between it and the below surface was changed. It may lead to some problems and make it begin to drop. I was nervous and quickly wanted to grasp it with my hand as it was still nearby the wall but failed to do so. However, there was some cables on the wall. And they catched the drone. So I used my hand to grasp it back. What a thrill!

The new job I do is about a payment app. I helped do some backend development using Java, Spring, Spring Cloud, Azure and do a little about AWS migration.

I learned a lot in this journey. Let me describe about some technical lessons.

* Software architecture is very important. The microservice structure is often better than monolithic application for large backend application. It is better to develop and deploy the code. We should think about how we structure the code in the long term view. 

* Azure EventHub Kafka propeties config is important. If we do it wrong, we may lose messages when the microservices scale up.

* Sometimes, we can check the build.log of the IDEA to fix bug.

* Every line of the code matters. We can directly jump to the location of the new code to check and suspect. Like why the log here isn't printed out.

* We should do the right thing as early as possible. If something is wrong, the problem is always there and keeps making trouble to us.

* It is hard to do the right thing. We should try it for a lot of ways and let the reality tell us what is best. We can only learn some precious lessons when we stay long enough. So it is important to keep notes about our decisions and reflect on them after some time. For the code, it is same too.

* We should write down our technical notes and precious lessons correctly in time. After some time, you may forget what is exactly happen.

* SSH Tunneling for 3 times is hard to understand sometimes. Use verbose mode to check carefully.

* Life is connecting dots. Debuging or coding is about connecting messages. To fix the bug of the backend code, we can check the frontend code too. My commitment in Anroid and iOS development between 2013 to 2015 was not a matter of wasting time though now I worked mainly as backend developer. 

And during this time, ChatGPT was hot. I began to read the book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning". Around the June, I read probably half of it. I felt I begin to understand them. Then I tried to implement the neural network from scratch. At the first time, the progress was really slow. There is like 50 lines of MNIST loader code. We use pickle function to load the data, and separate it to training data and validation data. And we make the shape like (784, 1).

For such simple code, I reimplemented it for 5 times to finally grasp it. And then I try to implement the neural network part. 

For the neural network part, the back propagation function and mini batch updating is hard for me to grasp regarding to every detail. I tried to write down what I know to understand the detail. 

In July, somehow I left the current job. I wrote down some articles to help me know what should I do in next years. Then I built a deep learning computer. It reminded me about in 2022, how I do the car maintainance by pumping out the engine oil and filling out the fresh one. It also reminded me that how I connect the circuit to make the LED shining according to the sound level of the music.

At that time, I found that some colleagues or friends delete me or remove connection with me in WeChat or LinkedIn. I don't know whether I publish too much recently. Though of course the highlight points of repost words of my articles in WeChat moments are not good. The reading experience is poor. I didn't publish in next months. One reason is to reflect on what I did in last year to lose some trust with people. My wife told me that I always want people respect me and I don't respect them often.

My heart is good that I want people be better and better. But the ways I do it are often not suitable. The learning is hard. Enjoying life is much comfortable.

So one of my problems is giving too many advices. In recent one year, suggesting people to learn English and something about AI to better prepare the future. I should only give advices when they ask to. I make myself kind of transparent to provide useful information. The truth is often kind of harsh.

But the ego is the enemy of growth. After I left the job, I thought I did well in this job but the feedback was only that I am ok to finish the job. At that time, I couldn't accept what it means. Only after half a year, I could appreciate what it says.

In the journey from Guangzhou to Lhasa Tibet, the scene was very good. I think out a lot of ideas during this journey. One is that we may need to make an audio AI-powered IDE, which you can write code when you drive. 

Using drone to record the beautiful views is kind of trouble. Because it takes time and one time shooting costs me about half an hour. But often you encounter very beautiful views and just couldn't help to record videos of them from the air to share with your friends.

In the journey, I was kind of boring after some days. Because I had taken the road trip of long distance before. I thought out an new idea. I wanted to be a woman to gain new experiences. This thought really excited me. So when I reached the big city Kunming, I bought some clothes for women, and even bought a new pair of eye glasses to look feminine.

So I dressed like a woman. In the elevator, I met two girls, who seems high school students were discussing about manicure. And the door opened, I said that I wanted to do it too. And they went out and one girl looked back to me and stonished to say to her friend that might be a girl? 

I had never encountered this in my life. It was really thrilling. We can only have new discovery when we do new things.

In the Kunming, I found a shop to buy wig. But it was expensive that it need around 1000 CNY. After I went back to Guangzhou, I bought more clothes of women style, and bought wig. After posting my feminine video to the social media, my classmate commented that the feminine version of myself really looked like my sister.

During the journey, I asked help of tow truck service for serveral times. The reason was that the charging stations were few in Tibet. And the distance between them were often 100km long. And in the charging stations, the chargers were probably not many. So if they couldn't work, you need to drive to the next charging station. And there are a lot of mountains. My electric car can only run for around 250km when climbing the mountains. I faced some challenges in the journey. One was that in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the tow truck service helped to transport my car to the charging station, but the car still couldn't be charged. Because the electricity of my car was 0% at that time. I asked the customer support and found some local people to help, like renting charging port or trying to charge in their home charging stations. The final solution was that we should disconnect the battery to give a fully reset of the car after opening the frunk. The the car can feel the charging electricity. Here, I used the word "feel" instead of "respond" to let it be more funny.

And in the return journey, I drove my car to the canal unintentionally. There was four reasons. The first is that the colors of the road and the canal are the same. The second is that there is no barrier between the canal and the road. The third is that in the 100m front of the road, there is a turning point to the right, and I drove a bit right of my car to let it into the canal, my subconscious was unaware that the car was leaving its normal route. The fourth is that I glanced to the right to find my second mobile phone, so my eyes were not looking the road at the moment. I asked the help of crane service to help to lift my car. I repaired my car after coming back to Guangzhou.

So this 8000km distance journey is happy and sad at the same time. I had 6 accidents in the journey, 4 of them were about no electricty in the mountains area, one is that I drove fast to hit a hole to make the tire blew out, the last is that I drove the car to the canal untentionally. The happy thing is that the scene and the people I met in the journey.

And in the journey, I attended an interview of full stack engineer position (Base HK) from OCBC Bank. This is the first interview I atteneded outside the China.

After returning from the Tibet, I continued to learn something about machine learning. I began to watch the nanoGPT video made by Andrej Karpathy again and again. And I tried to type out the code by myself. I still didn't understand. I printed out around 30 papers to learn. I read the book "Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning". I found more example projects or tutorials from PyTorch to learn.And then all these things become a little apparent to me. 

I began to apply jobs of machine leaning positions. And finally, I got an interview of the position Speech Machine Learning Engineer of a startup in Guangzhou. It was interesting to join such interview. I shared my knowledge to others though they didn't reach out to me later. We talked about Openai Whisper. I happend to begin to learn about it but didn't made some progress.

It gave me confidence about my move to machine learning. And then I attended the courses in the Coursera platform to get some certificates. I took two, Machine Learning Specialization and Deep Learning Specialization. I didn't watch much videos because I thought I already knew something. I found that the homework about writing code about neural network to recognize MNIST dataset is easy to me. Because I really learned carefully about this before.

I noticed that at the later phase, I began to lose patience. I even used ChatGPT to find out the answer of some homework. I was urgent to get these certificates to find machine learning jobs. This was bad behavior. The people who deeply understand the knowledge can know the people who don't. And I became aware of the knowledge gap between me and the qualified machine learning engineer. It may still needs one year for me. And the sad news was that in the market, there were no many positions for the junior machine learning  engineer. I stopped taking more certificates after taking two certificates with some cheating. And I learned the homework code which ChatGPT helped me to do in the weekend accompanying my daughter to play in the children center. It made me feel better.

So I began to understand a little more about recurrent neural network, recommender systems, reinforcement learning. But it should be still shallow understanding without thinking out the code by my own.

I began to take some Kaggle competions. I took 4 competions as of Jan 2023. It was really funny to write out some PyTorch code to solve problems. I recorded all these learning process in my GitHub project which named neural-networks-and-zhiwei-learning. It has 533 commits as of today.

I started to self doubt my switch to machine learning field as I have 1.25 million CNY of debt or mortgage. Jobless becomes painful.

My father gave me 45000 CNY to spend this hard time. My wife began to help me pay half of monthly mortgage payments. I began to apply full stack engineer or data engineer job. I did the test of the data engineer contractor position of Standard Chartered bank. This is my first time to do such test of this position. I knew the problems are easy but I just couldn't give good answer to them.

I attended the interview of the full stack engineer position of Standard Chartered bank. Failing to answer some basic knowledge of JVM made me embarrassed.

One of the lesson is to my field, for the long term view, I should prepare for the interview questions better. I should read the related materials again and again and do some experiements. 

I was questioning my decision to buy house last year. I already knew the strategy of China government to develop economy by making the China a big construction land couldn't continue. The 10 years in 2020 to 2030 of China will collapse without falling apart. There was a famous book about it. I followed the author in Twitter for long time and trusted what she says. I thought that I learned English well to work for global companies will saved me in this bad economics. 

I seems wrong. The market value of my house in Guangzhou dropped down from around 2 million to around 1.7 million. It made the case worsen. But not only me, a lot of people are suffering. And the recruiters told me that China and the global economics are bad in this year. There were many layoffs.
