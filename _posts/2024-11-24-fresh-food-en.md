title: "A Lesson in Food Freshness"
---

A recent experience with street food taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of food freshness. While enjoying Xinjiang barbecue from a local vendor, I ordered two lamb shashlik skewers and a portion of ham. The next day, I found myself dealing with an unfortunate case of diarrhea.

Upon reflection, I realized the culprit was likely the ham. Though it had been refrigerated at the vendor's stall, there was no way to know how long it had been sitting there or how many times it had been taken in and out of refrigeration. In contrast, the lamb shashlik was clearly fresh, as it was the vendor's signature dish with high turnover.

During my subsequent visits to the same barbecue stand, I stuck to ordering only the lamb shashlik. This experience made me realize that the issue isn't just about being careful when eating out—it's about being mindful of food freshness everywhere, including at home. Even in our own kitchens, we sometimes keep food in the refrigerator for too long, which can lead to similar problems.

The key lesson here isn't simply "be careful eating street food" but rather "pay attention to food freshness." Whether we're dining out or cooking at home, the freshness of our ingredients plays a crucial role in food safety. A refrigerator isn't a magical device that preserves food indefinitely—it merely slows down the spoilage process.

Remember: The best way to prevent food-related illness is to be mindful of what you're eating and how long it's been stored, regardless of where you're dining.
