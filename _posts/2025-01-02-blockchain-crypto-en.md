title: What matters, Cryptocurrency or Blockchain?
---

Cryptocurrency like AI, it is known for a large part of population. I think the population rate to know cryptocurrency are just like the population that can access free Internet. So in countries that are outside China, there will more percent of population knows cryptocurrency. 

The people who know cryptocurrency and the people who actually hold bitcoin or other cypro coins will have some proportion.

According to wikipedia,

> A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency designed to work through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.

> A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.

A Cryptocurrency is like an AI tool. A blockchain is like a neural network or a transformer. 

They all matters. Blockchains are the technology behind cryptocurrencies. Neural networks and transformers are the tecnology behind AI tools.

Cryptocurrency is internet of money. In future world, all money that are transacted in the digital world will using Cryptocurrency to transact. It is helpful in the cross border transaction. The swift transaction is expensive and slow. 

And for other digital transaction, you can now use cryto coins in Binace to buy apple gift card,  Nintendo eShop gift cards, etc. In future world, the amazon, temu, shopify, apple store will support to use crypto coins to directly purchase products. If in the digital Internet world, a large part of transaction happens in crypto. Surely, it is not difficult to use them in physcial world. The convenience stores can accpet the payment of crypto coins.

Using cryto coins, governments are hard to gain taxes from it. If companies give me salary using crytpo coins, how goverments track them. As transaction don't need government, the chossing rights of peers people do transaction with will leave to people. 

Government will start serving like a big company equal to the company in its area. They don't have higher powers than other companies. It starts to happen in United States. 

The future world will be self-governed. The rights about eveything will leave to the residents inside. 

People want more freedom and security. In the Internet world, people can use cryptocurrency or blockchain to have more freedom and security. But whatever, people still have physical bodies. People need weapons to protect themselves. The countries need high technical weapons like drones or missiles to protect its citizens.

In the United States, the right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment to the Constitution, Other countries like Canada, Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic and Finland have relatively permissive gun laws. 

In China, tough it is not allowed guns, as people want, they can use smart way to cause large hurt. On 11 November 2024, a man drove his SUV into people on the exercise track at the Zhuhai Stadium sports center in Zhuhai, Guangdong, China, killing 35 and injuring 43 more. 

Money freedom is important aspect of life. However, security and body freedom is more important too. Living in a healthy community is important. 

And in the Cryptocurrency or Blockchain prevalent world, there are more trust and freedom. 

Back to what matters, there are two ways for the future. One is current internet platform support payment of crypto coins or that current internet platform needs to be rewrote or invented in blockchain way. I think that the previous one is enough. As we can hold most of our money using cryptos and only monthly pay or pay one time to buy products or services in digital world. We can trust most of internet platforms in this small amount of money. 

And for the latter one, I think the innovation about blockchain will happen firstly in money side. How people use money to trade, invest stocks, do the options will be invented by blockchain ways. If the stock platforms support the crypto coins to charge its balance, why don't let crypto coins to run through their system. The path stock <-> platform blance <-> crypto coins can be shorten as stock <-> crypto coins.
