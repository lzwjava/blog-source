title: "Connecting HDMI to Your Graphics Card Instead of the Motherboard Port"  
audio: true  
---

Recently, I moved my desktop computer from my house to my parents' house. During the setup, I connected the HDMI cable to what seemed like the obvious HDMI port on the back of the computer. However, the monitor remained blank no matter how many times I tried to connect it.

Then, it hit me: I had connected the HDMI cable to the motherboard's port instead of the graphics card's port. Once I realized this, I quickly disconnected the HDMI cable from the motherboard and plugged it into the HDMI port on the graphics card. Instantly, the monitor displayed everything perfectly.

Since I hadn't used this computer in almost six months, I decided to update the system. I ran the following commands to ensure all software and libraries were up to date:

```bash
sudo snap refresh  
sudo apt upgrade  
```

This simple update process made sure my system was running smoothly with the latest updates.

**Key Takeaway:** Always check which HDMI port is connected to your graphics card, especially if you're setting up a new system or moving your computer to a new location. This small step can save you time and frustration.
