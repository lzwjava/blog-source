title: "Connect HDMI to Graphics Card Instead of Motherboard Port"  
audio: true

Recently, I moved my desktop computer from my house to my parents' house. When setting it up, I connected the HDMI cable to the motherboard's HDMI port, but the monitor didn’t display anything. I tried several times, but it still didn’t work.  

Then, I suddenly realized: *Oh, there are HDMI ports on the graphics card!* I disconnected the HDMI cable from the motherboard and plugged it into the graphics card’s HDMI port. Immediately, the monitor worked perfectly.  

Since I hadn’t used this computer for almost half a year, I decided to update the system. I ran the following commands to install the latest upgrades:  

```bash
sudo snap refresh  
sudo apt upgrade  
```  

This ensured all the libraries and software were up to date.
