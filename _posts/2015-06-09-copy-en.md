title: "Why is Imitation the Best Way to Learn?"

I reviewed my experiences learning Android and iOS, and found that many valuable knowledge I gained were through imitation.

How to imitate? Start two projects. For example, imitate Jack's friend circle implementation. I look at two lines of his code, then write his code in my project. If I don't understand, I go back to look, and if I understand, I write it in my way, writing more at once.

Using this method, I learned to write Android's pull-to-refresh and list view deeply, iOS's handwriting UI, and so on. I experienced a rise in Android's pull-to-refresh for the first time, which allowed me to control views directly without using xml. I also learned gestures. There were moments when I copied code from others and suddenly understood things. Some things were not clear to me no matter how much I thought about it. I overlooked many things while reading the code, and missed important details. However, when I wrote the code and operated it with my hands, I became more engaged, and noticed more details, eventually understanding the concept. For instance, in my previous post about visual differences. Initially, I didn't know that moving the background image horizontally or vertically would cause it to scroll. I noticed this while copying code. I learned a method for creating the glass effect.

Previously, on iOS, I used xib extensively, but I gave up writing code several times. When I was mimicking a friend's project, I was like a copycat. Most of it was the same, except for the names. However, I still noticed some important things about writing code. For example, if the height of a list cell varies depending on the content, you need to calculate its height before drawing it and pass it to the tableview. How do you calculate height? One method is to use a fixed width to calculate height. These things became apparent while mimicking the code.

When mimicking, I also became more engaged. I found myself getting sleepy while reading the code. One reason was that my brain was tired, and the other was that my body was completely still, making it easy to fall into a resting state. One of my friends takes notes while looking at code. Someone on Zhihu said to read the code to understand the issue. These are all good suggestions. The key is to participate, not just observe. Some people can stay focused just by looking and thinking.

Mimicking and creating are different experiences. Mimicking is easier because you can simply write the same code and copy it. The creative process is more challenging. When mimicking someone else's app, the layout is easier to calculate because you can see it. Mimicking is easier for this reason, so you can sustain it longer. You won't give up because it's too difficult. However, the knowledge gained from mimicking can sometimes be more extensive than that gained from creating.

Mimicking reduces the need for trial and error and helps you quickly master correct knowledge. While learning programming, you can work on projects and search Google at the same time. This approach leads to a lot of trial and error, which may not be effective, especially for beginners. Many trial and error attempts are meaningless. However, mastering the correct knowledge and understanding why it is correct is sufficient. For example, with HTML formatting, I found some HTML formatting projects to copy and paste people's code, line by line, while thinking about it. I might learn faster and more effectively this way than by randomly experimenting. Imitate! or Copy me!
