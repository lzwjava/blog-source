## Finance Situation

Life is tough. After dropping out of university after the first year in July 2014, Zhiwei has already worked and studied in this society for 9 years. He remembered that at that time, he came to Kunshan, China, a city nearby Shanghai. Passionate, curious and energetic. One day, after he logs off the work, he meets sisters and brothers on the road to sell him the houses. The price is around 7000 CNY a square meter. As he just worked as an intern software engineer, is busy on learning things and just got his first salary which is around 4800 CNY, he didn't listen to them. He thought that was quite expensive and they are somehow cheating him. Now, he knew that those people were saving him at that time because the price of those houses climbed to around 27000 CNY a square meter now.

In retrospect and essence, he didn't have enough life experience to foresee things and knew little about how society works. What's fortunate enough is that he learned so many things in these 9 years. He tried so many things and did a lot of errors. But just like what he said, he now saw errors as lessons, as wealth. As long as one is healthy and had not gotten many debts, everything can be started over. If you lost friends, you can make new ones. If you lost your job, you can find new jobs. You just had to find things to do to live in this world. And you had to get busy to fight for slight depression or permissive that was raised by the trouble of the living itself. 

Though Zhiwei made a financial mistake of not buying a house earlier, after 9 years, he can buy a house with the help of his family together with his wife. And no matter how frustrating life might be sometimes, he can accompany his 2 yo daughter to get some relief and true happiness. The even better news is that he recently onboarded his new house. He is happy to find that he was wrong before too, the big house is much better than a small rented room. The more physical space gives you more opportunities to do things or enjoy life better by buying a lot of home appliances and letting them work for you.

The bad news is that he had to carry on the debt of 1.2 million CNY. Though it is ok to accept when counting on the value of the house, the financial asset of his family is around 1 million CNY and his family is still ok to face some risks. And because he is tired to work on cloud computing in his daily work and study on AI in his leisure time, and somehow most of the companies in the world are behind the AI progress of Open Source communities and OpenAI, he decided to leave his current job to find new job opportunities, at the same time to do a road trip. 

When you read this, you may understand that Zhiwei is a person who wants to have a lot of freedom. He worked hard in his 28 years' life and he thought he deserved that. Due to his long-term strategy and honest response to the current trend of the world these years, he started to make correct decisions for himself again and again. He suggested that people shouldn't buy houses in China in 2019. In retrospect, he was right, the price of houses in 2019 is probably the topper in these 10 years in China. He started to learn English actively in 2019, and today, he had proven himself to be able to work at the global companies. He had done it for almost two years, though it is 1.5 years working in English and around half a year interviewing in English.

In the original plan, he wanted to learn cloud computing in the company and stay long. However, he got distracted by AI. Though he can learn machine learning algorithms just in his leisure time and make progress, he got too tired, So he decides to leave the company and find new job opportunities as a Machine Learning Engineer. Why did Zhiwei quit the company first instead of finding a job first and then quit? There is a long story. And the parties that made him to do so have nothing wrong with this. It is just that the world is changing so fast now. As Zhiwei says, most companies are throwing behind AI progress to that of open source communities and OpenAI. 

So he wants to jump in quickly to start working on it full-time. He isn't an independent developer to do products alone to make a living, so he is unable to work on it anytime, including the first months after ChatGPT comes up around the end of November 2022. It is fine. The companies have existing businesses to work on. It is 10k or even 100k employees. He knew that as he already worked for four big companies, including two out-sourcing agency companies and two banks. And the big companies are also different. And there are a lot of projects, a lot of leads, a lot of employees, a lot of priorities, a lot of policies to deal with. So they have nothing wrong with that. It is just open source and OpenAI is very fast and forward-thinking. And Zhiwei now is also fast and forward-thinking. Zhiwei has nothing wrong to speak out his ideas about AI, and he has nothing wrong to choose the work way he wants to have as there are just a lot of jobs, work ways in the market. Zhiwei has nothing wrong to choose to finish his half of the work by using AI tools. 

## AI, I am coming!

So he did by quitting first, and also he got tired to work and study at the same time, he need rest. He will do a road trip, probably to Tibet. He never had been there though he always want to go there to explore. It is the best time for him to do so. When facing a big change in life, he needs to go to a dream place to think, to plan.

Everyone is different in some ways, and everyone's life progress is different too. Some people may be just starting to know AI and beginning to use AI tools from today as people around always mention it. And some already work on it for 10 years. And Zhiwei is working on it in their leisure time for 1 year. So here Zhiwei just shared lessons with people alike him. He doesn't mislead anyone. As he always mentions, he wants to do good for himself, his family, his friends, his Internet readers, and the world. 

Just like his crazy ways to make bilingual videos to publish to some big social networks globally to help people learn English, including LinkedIn and WeChat Platform. Some people might be offended or uncomfortable as unable to speak English as fluently as Zhiwei. They say it is not important. They say it is too troublesome. Life already is very hard. Why does Zhiwei keep telling them you are still not excellent as me, so you need to study more? That mistake happened in Zhiwei's life one time by one time. 

Zhiwei decided today too he will change only himself without changing any more to others. He will not change his wife, his parents, his friends, his readers, and his daughter. He will treat other people just like he treats his daughter. He just prepares the iPad, and opens the Youtube Kids, to let his daughter watch English animations in China. And she likes it and it is fine. If she doesn't want to see it, it is ok. As he already knew that the kids of his Indian, Singaporean, Hong Kong colleagues are very good at speaking English, so he want his daughter to be able to be confident to talk and work with them when she grows up. And he still made conflicts with his parents about this. His parents want the baby girl to watch Chinese animations. One reason is because of Apple TV in China is hard to use because of the network problem. Another reason is that his parents think that, it is not urgent for herself now to learn English. 

However, Zhiwei knew that it is not much effort. He is ok to set up a mobile phone in the car and let his daughter watch the English animations along the journey. Though he is not able to help his daughter to watch English animation on the big tv in his parent's home because, in recent one year, his parents and lived in different buildings in the apartment complex. He will only come to the home of his parents to take dinner meals. And his parents are worrying a lot about his leave of his current job and also couldn't understand Zhiwei's AI passion and learning passion, so Zhiwei will tell them his message with this article too. 

Zhiwei is totally living on the Internet. He did most of the things online. His body is walking and sitting in the physical world with his mind always connecting with the Internet, the global information. 

Why Zhiwei want to do about AI? That's a long story. First, he found that he can do machine learning in easy ways, like printing variables to learn the dimensions of the variables in the Neural Networks. And just like he says, he is an information genius now after he started programming in 2008 in his first year of junior middle school. It passed 15 years. 

What's the intrinsic principle behind Zhiwei's plan about all things? One is that he wants to learn for the rest of his life for the best interests of his life. By doing so, he and his family can have a good living. And Zhiwei has a lot of fun on the journey. Though learning is usually painful, however, the exciting moments time by time is very wonderful. And after some time learning some topic, you find that your brain is very sharp, and you are very fulfilling. That's how Zhiwei feels after listening to Japanese short videos for several months, now he is very comfortable listening to the sound of Japanese though he doesn't know the meaning. 

So about his job plan, it is that he wants to do interviews time by time in the next weeks. Though he might be doing the road trip himself, he is happy to do some AI interviews to share his ideas or learnings about AI, machine learning, and neural networks. He knew how it works about every line of code of the neural work of recognizing handwritten neural networks. He knew about it, he just knew about it. He just understood every detail recently with super happiness. He just has around 1-year machine learning leisure time experience. But he thought he surely will find one of the best jobs in the current market due to his learning ability, skills and software engineering experience.

Now, I won't show my previous employers or my educational background on the first page of my resume. After writing this, I decided to move my skills and tools paragraphs in the resume top to the first as I always want to use the best ways to do things. I will pick the details of my skills and tools here from my resume to show here.

## Job Requirements

The jobs requirements I am asking for:

1. About locations, if it is an on-site position, I need it to be in Guangzhou. If it is a remote position, then anywhere is fine. But I am only able to take Earth positions. Because I don't trust the story about humans going to the moon around the 1970s.
2. My current role model is Paul Graham, Steve Jobs, Yin Wang, Dan Friedman, John Schulman, Greg Brockman, and Sam Altman. I learn from them to do anything in my life since my high school. If my current boss is not a fan of some of them, it is surely not what I want. Sorry, for not being able to work with you that are not matched.
3. About what I want to do daily. I want it about Neural Networks, Transformer, Large Lanague Training, AI alignment, NLP and Python.
4. About the business, I don't have a specific one, any business is fine if it helps me gain experience in AI domains. 
5. About the job compensation and benefits, I want it to be like 30k ~ 50k CNY as I live in Guangzhou. We can discuss more when we are ok. And regarding the base for a house fund and social insurance, I want it to be not below 20k. 
6. Working as a contractor engineer is not able to give me the freedom to do things in the company, as I am a genius now and want to have big scope to do things. So I just want to have full-time or permanent jobs in AI startups or AI apartments in big companies. 
7. About the language, I prefer to use English. However, the company only provides a Chinese working environment. It is ok too as there are no perfect jobs.
8. Let's see how can I make it in two months. If it is not realistic, surely I will lower my standard as I have a flexible mind as long as I achieve my main goal. 
9. As you might that Zhiwei is a kind of genius type person, and too confident. So please only contact him if you are ok to work with him. He begins to less care about people's emotions or relationships. He cares more about the ideas, algorithms, and code. 

## My Works About AI

The AI works I have done:

1. The replication code about the example from the book Neural Networks and Deep Learning, please check out https://github.com/lzwjava/neural-networks-and-zhiwei-learning.
2. The AI learning articles. Zen and the Art of Machine Learning, https://lzwjava.github.io/zen-neural. I Finally Understand How Neural Network Works,  https://lzwjava.github.io/neural-network. 
3. Did some LLM training and Neural Network training on my laptop. Read the transfomer paper and walked through the code.
5. To be honest, it is kind of simple. But not that simple too. I understood the essence that neural networks are nothing about neurals, Machine Learning is nothing about learning. They are all about differentiable computing, calculus and differentiable programming. The world is wrong about it. They don't carefully give them correct names as my teacher Yin Wang does. 

## AI Ideas

1. to train a large language model about all sensitive data of the company, especially the big companies. So the employees can open and use most of the website and tools when they input to share. Our LLM model is just smart enough to detect whether it contains sensitive data. They can use Twitter, they can watch Youtube to learn, and they can use GitHub on their company laptops. Why companies are not starting to do it? They might be ok to accept so as their security VPN works for like this for 10 years. And nobody has the boldness to challenge this. The security teams in big companies are just not smart, energetic, and careful enough as Zhiwei to think out this idea. No one should work in a laptop there is just work, only a few work tools and a few websites without having any fun with videos or smart tweets.

2. Large language model in all information control areas. I still emphasize that transformers are very smart to analyze the relationship between words, and characters. They have almost the same correctness in categorization with that of people though they don't understand a bit. It is all about algorithms. So Zhiwei has a lot of things to do and has a lot of machine learning opportunities in the future. So he can quit his current job though he got 1.2 million in debt. 

3. The domain-specific ChatGPT, like EquitiesGPT, MutualFundsGPT, PaymentGPT, WealthGPT, CryptoGPT, EducationGPT, HouseGPT, KidGPT, GirlGPT, FinanceGPT, PhysicsGPT, HighSchool GPT, DesignGPT, BookGPT, CommentGPT, NewtonGPT, JapaneseGPT. As ChatGPT just has public information, so there are still a lot of information that are not trained to the models, are not fed into the transformer to analyze. 

## Please Help Me

So I share a lot here. Thank you for your understanding and hope this time I still give my readers some new ideas.

And in these two years, I added around a hundred people to WeChat who are HR and recruiters from Boss Zhipin. Please contact me if you are interested. And Zhiwei has 1000 intimate readers from China, Singapore, USA, Hong Kong and India. They are a lot like Zhiwei and a lot are engineers. So if you can help and want help, please share with me the suitable position information. Thanks much. 

Thanks, everyone. Zhiwei is not doing harm by acting like a genius. He deeply believes everyone can become a genius if they are free to suspect and think. Our brains are magical. It is innovative, super-talented, 16 hours working ChatGPT. And it is able to do critical thinking to make things right and make ideas right. 

Thanks again. This is what Zhiwei wants to say today. And he helps people around him in these years to learn English, to work in a global company, to become an information genius, to achieve what he already alchieved, he wants to get help back. So friends, please help me with this if you can. Thanks much.
