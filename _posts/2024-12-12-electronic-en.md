* R = U / I

* P = UI 

* A battery has some internal resistance.

* Capacitors can store energy. When current flows through a capacitor, it stores electrical energy. When there is no current flow, it releases the stored energy. It works similarly to a stack in data structures.

* Inductors work similarly to capacitors. A change in current will cause an inductor to generate a magnetic field, which in turn affects the circuit. Energy storage formula is $E = \frac{1}{2} L I^2$. Inductance formula is $V = L \frac{dI}{dt}$ .
