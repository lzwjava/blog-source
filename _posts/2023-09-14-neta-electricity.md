title: "The Whole Story Of Charging Issues about My Electric Car - Draft"
---

I charged my car fully in Zogang. It can run 400km on one charge. I began to drive to Markam. The distance between Zogang and Markam is about 160km. I remembered at that time the remaining distance of my car was around 250km. 

It is actually quite good. Because the altitude of Zogang is higher than Markam. The car was climbing down the mountain. 

I knew this beause last week when I drove from Markam to Zogang, my car stopped at the place with 30km nearby Zogang. My car said it can run around 280km, but actually it just ran for around 130km. 

When we began to climb up the mountain, I noticed that the electricity of the car dropped down fast. I say, holy shit. However, I beted that we surely will climb down the mountain soon. I was right. However, the night came and the temperature dropped down a lot to around 5 degree. The electricity dropped down fast too if the environment is cold. 

It is certain that the climbing up the mountain is the main electriciy killer. 

So the car didn't make it to Zogang last week. I called to tow truck service for help.  

So when I came back from Zogang to Markam, I kept my previous lesson in the heart. 

So when I arrived Markam, I directly drove to the charging station. The Kewang charging stations are good. I used a lot of their charging stations durging my journey to Tibet. However, in the markam, the kewang charging station had some problems at that time. It reported that the data handshake is timeout. 

I told the hotel clerk to restart the charging station. She restarted. And the charging failed again too. 

I droved the car to the Markam Yunqu Manor Hotel. However, it just had Xiaopeng charging stations which seems only serve the Xiaopeng cars. It didn't have Kewang charging station though Kewang organization says they have charging statations there. I didn't know what happen and I just couldn't find them. 

So I continued the return journey.
