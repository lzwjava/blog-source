I bought a electric hair clipper from jd.com in 2019. I had been using this product for some time. I used it to cut my hair and for other reasons I went to a barber shop, like half time and a half time.

It is good. But the lowest part of the hair in the back of my head is not easy to cut. I tried the below solutions, but failed. One reason is that below solutions made things too complicated. 

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

</div>

I worked out a new method. It is not perfect, but it is good enough for me.

I used 13mm clipper head to cut the whole part of my head firstly. Then I used 5mm clipper head to cut the lowest part of my head. But how you control the clipper head to only cut the lowest part of my head? 

You need to use it like a shovel. You need to put the clipper head in the lowest part of your head and then move it back and forth. 

It is a little hard to describe. You need to try it yourself.
