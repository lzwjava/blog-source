 In 2005, Paul Graham established YC Incubator. In his article "Hiring is Obsolete," he stated:

Nowadays, the three tech giants are Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft, with their founders having an average age of 24. It is clear that graduate students can launch companies. If graduate students can do it, why can't undergraduate students?

Over the past ten years, we have seen numerous transformations. We must now ask, why can some college students succeed, while some high school students cannot? These societal shifts are gradual but persistent. The internet has expanded opportunities, offering a wealth of knowledge and connecting individuals with similar goals. Some high school students initiate their businesses, and by the time they graduate from college, they may have accomplished significant achievements. One day, upon graduating from college, they might discover their peers of the same age, who started their own companies from scratch and are going public at the age of 22. They might be astonished.1. This trend is observed in various fields. Thiel Fellowship recipients, aged 24 or 25, include those who have achieved nuclear fusion, made progress in ocean garbage clean-up, co-founders of the OYO hotel chain, co-founders of Luminar (a laser radar company) listed on the stock market, and the creator of blockchain, V God.

2. Age is not a barrier. The secret to these accomplishments lies in passion for the subject itself.

3. In today's education, we should encourage children to pursue their interests, help them find the best resources and teachers on the internet, and facilitate making like-minded friends, nurturing a love for learning. A child who loves learning holds a promising future.

4. During my middle school years, I came across self-growth blogs and was inspired by the internet achievements of some competition gold medalists. Similarly, some elementary school students today are motivated on the internet. Many are addicted to games, but some explore game creation and learn about it through online resources.

5. Young teachers in schools are improving as a whole. Teachers, subjects, and classmates are not easily chosen. Although the overall situation is improving, students may have a negative school experience due to scolding teachers, disliking certain subjects, or dealing with unruly classmates, resulting in a dislike of learning.1. Schools could provide an option for students to skip grades based on their performance during exams.
2. During final exams, students should be permitted to take exams for higher grades in addition to their current grade.
3. This encourages students to skip grades if they meet certain conditions.
4. If this option exists and some students successfully take it, it motivates more students to do the same.
5. Many students could potentially complete elementary school in three years, middle school and high school in three years each.
6. This may lead to an increase in extracurricular tutoring institutions.
7. This could reveal the deficiencies of exam-oriented education.
8. Some students may complete middle and high school in six, seven, or nine years.
9. The performance of students will become more remarkable, some may even finish in four years at the age of ten.
10. Between ages three and ten, there are seven years during which a child who loves reading and learning can gain a vast amount of knowledge through the internet.
11. The knowledge required for exams is not extensive.
12. In the future, people will realize that the current education system is outdated.
13. Elementary and middle school last twelve years, but students don't have to follow the conventional path of advancing year by year.
14. This will lead to overall progress.
15. An ambitious teenager, aged 14 or 15, may envy peers who don't have to study in class.
16. Instead of letting a few people enjoy preferential treatment in competitions, all students should have equal opportunities.
17. One day, we can tell children, "You are free. If you work hard and achieve good grades, you can skip grades." A minority of people in society create significant wealth, which is something to be encouraged through value creation. A 10-year-old who completes middle and elementary school, starts a 3D game venture, learns online, takes his company public at 20, and becomes a billionaire deserves praise. Although academic qualifications are valued by institutions such as state-owned enterprises, governments, schools, and research institutes, and most large companies consider degrees, dropping out of high school or college to start a business or work on projects might limit future opportunities. However, with a grade-skipping mechanism, these issues can be resolved.

Children can learn early that competition is fierce. For instance, a classmate finishing elementary school in two years while others are still struggling. Ambitious children view this as a positive, as they don't have to wait for high school exam results and face competition among tens of thousands of students in the province. They realize that ranking first in elementary or middle school doesn't guarantee success, as there are always those who are better.

This mechanism aligns with real-world society, where competition for wealth is not among peers but among all adults. Preparing children for this reality by letting them know they will compete with older adults for jobs and businesses in the future is beneficial. Competition drives progress, and for some children, it offers an opportunity to learn from those who are more skilled.

Dedicated parents equip their children with a broad range of skills, work hard to afford houses in better school districts for better education, and engage teachers from elite universities. Children in third and fourth-tier cities may not have the same opportunities. However, with grade-skipping and the internet, diligent children from these areas who complete elementary school in three years and enter the best local middle schools can compete with children from wealthier families. In China, we could establish a scholarship akin to the Thiel Fellowship, encouraging those under twenty to pursue their ambitious dreams. Influential entrepreneurs and investors in China, such as Lei Jun, Lu Qi, Ma Huateng, Zhang Yiming, Wang Xing, and Zhu Xiaohu, should take the lead. Chinese children can do what American children can do. I believe children who proactively apply for such a scholarship online will have a promising future. Five years later, some of them may achieve remarkable results, inspiring others. China might have individuals in their twenties capable of creating nuclear fusion on their own. Just as Elon Musk's boldness inspired numerous entrepreneurs, China's young Musks will also motivate many young people.

The future is already here; it's just not evenly distributed. Young people might surprise us.

Technological progress benefits everyone. We need not feel anxious about young people's capabilities. Entrepreneurial failure is typically not due to competition but because the entrepreneur failed to provide value to their target users. Unemployment is usually not due to others being superior but because one lacks the demanded skills.

When a sixteen-year-old creates nuclear fusion, works as an independent developer, undertakes open-source projects, builds small rockets, becomes a popular science blogger, or writes research papers, what will society witness?

As more and more ten-year-olds show interest in programming, optics, autonomous driving, mechanics, electronics, materials, etc., find resources online, follow numerous bloggers, and make friends with like-minded individuals, what will society witness?1. Knowledge appears plentiful nowadays, yet its core remains relatively unchanged. Often, knowledge must be actively acquired and pondered over to be absorbed into one's mind. With the internet, the next generation can learn from the greatest minds of the past, accessing the wisdom of previous scientists, and connecting with like-minded individuals on social media for long-term companionship.

2. Adults have consistently surpassed what adults from a decade or a century ago considered difficult. I am confident that future children will also be capable of accomplishing what past children could not. Children, have faith in yourselves; you have the ability to succeed.
