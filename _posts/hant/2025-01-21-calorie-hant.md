I often find many beverages too sweet. While sugar-free options are healthier, they can feel too restrictive.

For instance, Vitasoy's original flavor has 196 kJ per 100ml, and their chocolate flavor contains 262 kJ per 100ml.

Other beverages include: Naxue's tea at 82 kJ per 100ml, Coca-Cola at 180 kJ per 100ml, Sprite at 149 kJ per 100ml, and Lang Fong Yuen at 88 kJ per 100ml.

After trying this for some time when buying beverages, it has been very helpful.
