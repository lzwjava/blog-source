title: 過氧化氫可以治療香港腳嗎

When I was in middle school, I had athlete's foot. Sometimes parts of my foot were white, and the skin would peel off, leaving some dead skin. It seemed my foot had been sweating for a long time. When I came back home, my parents would help me wash my foot. It shocked them.

我讀中學時，曾經患有香港腳。有時我腳上的部分皮膚會變白，然後脫落，留下一些死皮。我的腳似乎長時間出汗。當我回家時，我的父母會幫我洗腳，他們被嚇到了。

After graduating from high school, I became less involved in sports. Though I knew my feet usually smelled, especially in the summer, I ignored it for years.

中學畢業後，我更少參與運動。儘管我知道我的腳通常有異味，尤其是在夏天，但我多年來一直漠視這個問題。

In recent years, I read Yin Wang's articles about athlete's foot. He tried many ways, and in the comments of some product, he saw someone mention hydrogen peroxide to cure athlete's foot.

近年來，我閱讀了尹王關於香港腳的文章。他嘗試了許多方法，並在某些產品的評論中看到有人提到用 hydrogen peroxide 來治療香港腳。

Around 2023, I initially experimented with hydrogen peroxide, but my usage was inconsistent. I observed bubbles forming on my slippers. The 3% hydrogen peroxide solution I bought was inexpensive, costing about 30 CNY for a 5-liter bottle. I also purchased several 500 ml bottles filled with hydrogen peroxide, costing about 5 CNY each. However, I only used the solution once or twice before leaving the bottles mostly unused.

大約在 2023 年，我最初嘗試使用 hydrogen peroxide，但我的使用並不持續。我觀察到拖鞋上形成了氣泡。我購買的 3% hydrogen peroxide 溶液很便宜，5 升裝的價格約為 30 人民幣。我還購買了幾個裝有 hydrogen peroxide 的 500 毫升瓶子，每個約 5 人民幣。然而，我只使用了一兩次，然後這些瓶子大部分就閒置了。

About a year later, I tried using the solution again, but it had lost its effectiveness; the bubbles no longer appeared on the slippers.

大約一年後，我再次嘗試使用該溶液，但它已經失效；拖鞋上不再出現氣泡。

So, I bought a new bottle of hydrogen peroxide, and it worked well. After using it and rubbing my foot, the unpleasant smell was significantly reduced.

於是，我買了一瓶新的 hydrogen peroxide，效果很好。使用後並搓洗我的腳，難聞的味道明顯減少了。

I've lived in Guangzhou, China, in recent years. So in the summer, even in a room with air conditioning, the smell of feet is unpleasant. I wear slippers at home and sandals in the office, so my feet are usually exposed to the air. It's really important to have clean feet, not just for others but for myself.

近年我住在中國廣州。所以在夏天，即使在有空調的房間裡，腳的味道也很難聞。我在家穿拖鞋，在辦公室穿涼鞋，所以我的腳通常都暴露在空氣中。保持腳部清潔真的很重要，不僅是為了別人，也是為了我自己。

I began to learn more about hydrogen peroxide with AI chatbots. It's a useful chemical ingredient. To save hydrogen peroxide, I started using disposable foot covers. After soaking my feet, I use the remaining liquid to soak my slippers and sandals.

我開始與 AI 聊天機器人一起學習更多關於 hydrogen peroxide 的知識。它是一種有用的化工原料。為了節省 hydrogen peroxide，我開始使用即棄腳套。泡完腳後，我會用剩下的液體來浸泡我的拖鞋和涼鞋。
