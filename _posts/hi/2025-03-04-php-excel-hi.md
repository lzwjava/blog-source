### Survey Note: Comprehensive Guide to Using "phpoffice/phpexcel": "^1.8"

This note provides a detailed exploration of using the PHPExcel library, specifically version 1.8 or higher, as specified by the Composer dependency "phpoffice/phpexcel": "^1.8". Given its deprecation status, this guide also highlights considerations for modern alternatives and ensures a thorough understanding for both beginners and advanced users. The content is structured to cover installation, usage, dependencies, and additional context, ensuring all relevant details from the research are included.

#### Background and Context
PHPExcel एक PHP library है designed for reading and writing spreadsheet files, particularly Excel formats like .xls और .xlsx. The version specification "^1.8" indicates a semantic versioning range, meaning any version from 1.8 up to, but not including, 2.0, which, given the library's history, points to version 1.8.1 as the latest, released in 2015. However, research indicates that PHPExcel was officially deprecated in 2017 और archived in 2019, with the recommendation to migrate to its successor, PhpSpreadsheet, due to lack of maintenance और potential security issues. This context is crucial for users, as it suggests caution for new projects, though the guide will focus on using the specified version as requested.

The library's functionality includes creating, reading, and manipulating Excel files, supporting formats beyond Excel such as CSV और HTML. It was part of the PHPOffice project, which has since shifted focus to PhpSpreadsheet, offering improved features और PHP standards compliance. Given the current date, March 3, 2025, और the library's archival status, users should be aware of its limitations, especially with newer PHP versions और security updates.

#### Installation Process
To install "phpoffice/phpexcel": "^1.8", the process leverages Composer, the PHP dependency manager. The steps are as follows:
- Add the dependency to your `composer.json` file under the "require" section: `"phpoffice/phpexcel": "^1.8"`.
- Run the command `composer install` in your project directory. This command downloads the library and updates the `vendor` directory with the necessary files.

The caret (^) notation in Composer follows semantic versioning, ensuring that versions 1.8, 1.8.1, or any patch updates are installed, but not versions that would break compatibility (i.e., not 2.0 or higher). Given the library's last release was 1.8.1 in 2015, this typically resolves to version 1.8.1.

Research confirms that the Packagist page for phpoffice/phpexcel lists it as abandoned, suggesting phpoffice/phpspreadsheet instead, but it remains available for installation, aligning with the user's request.

#### Basic Usage: Writing to Excel
Once installed, using PHPExcel involves including the autoload file for class loading and then utilizing its classes for spreadsheet manipulation. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

- **Include the Autoload File:** Start your PHP script with `require 'vendor/autoload.php';`. This line ensures all Composer-installed libraries, including PHPExcel, are loaded automatically, leveraging PSR-0 autoloading as per the library's structure from 2015.

- **Create a New PHPExcel Object:** Initialize a new spreadsheet with `$objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();`. This object represents the entire workbook, allowing for multiple sheets and properties.

- **Work with Sheets:** Access the active sheet using `$sheet = $objPHPExcel->getSheet(0);` for the first sheet, or create a new one with `$sheet = $objPHPExcel->createSheet();`. Sheets are zero-indexed, so `getSheet(0)` targets the first sheet.

- **Set Cell Values:** Populate cells using the `setCellValue` method, e.g., `$sheet->setCellValue('A1', 'Hello');`. This method takes a cell reference (like 'A1') and the value to insert, which can be text, numbers, or formulas.

- **Save the File:** To save, create a writer for the desired format. For Excel 2007 and above (.xlsx), use `$writer = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');`. Then save with `$writer->save('filename.xlsx');`. Other formats include 'Excel5' for .xls (Excel 95) or 'CSV' for comma-separated values.

An example script for writing might look like:
```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();
$sheet = $objPHPExcel->getSheet(0);
$sheet->setCellValue('A1', 'Hello');
$sheet->setCellValue('B1', 'World');
$writer = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');
$writer->save('hello_world.xlsx');
```
This creates a simple Excel file with "Hello" in A1 और "World" in B1.

#### Basic Usage: Reading from Excel
Reading from an Excel file follows a similar pattern but starts with loading the file:
- **Load the File:** Use `$objPHPExcel = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load('filename.xlsx');` to load an existing Excel file. The IOFactory can automatically detect the file type, but you can specify a reader, e.g., `$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007'); $objPHPExcel = $objReader->load('filename.xlsx');` for explicit type.

- **Access Sheets and Cells:** After loading, access sheets as before, e.g., `$sheet = $objPHPExcel->getSheet(0);`. Retrieve cell values with `$cellValue = $sheet->getCell('A1')->getValue();`, which returns the content of the specified cell.

An example for reading:
```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$objPHPExcel = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load('hello_world.xlsx');
$sheet = $objPHPExcel->getSheet(0);
$cellValue = $sheet->getCell('A1')->getValue();
echo $cellValue; // Outputs "Hello"
```
This reads the value from A1, demonstrating basic retrieval.

#### Dependencies and Requirements
PHPExcel has specific PHP requirements and extensions needed for operation:
- **PHP Version:** Requires PHP 5.2 or 7.0 or higher, as per the Packagist metadata. Given the current date, March 3, 2025, most modern PHP installations should meet this, but older setups may need updates.
- **Extensions:** The library depends on `ext-mbstring`, `ext-XML`, और `ext-XMLWriter`, which must be enabled in your PHP configuration. These extensions handle string encoding, XML parsing, और XML writing, respectively, essential for Excel file operations.

Users should verify these extensions are active using `phpinfo()` or checking the `php.ini` file, ensuring no compatibility issues arise.

#### Additional Features and Formats
Beyond basic read/write, PHPExcel supports various file formats, which is an unexpected detail for users familiar only with Excel. The library can handle:
- Excel 2007 (.xlsx) via 'Excel2007' writer/reader.
- Excel 95 (.xls) via 'Excel5'.
- CSV files via 'CSV'.
- HTML via 'HTML'.

When saving, specify the writer type; when reading, IOFactory often detects automatically, but explicit readers can be used for reliability. For example, to save as .xls:
```php
$writer = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel5');
$writer->save('filename.xls');
```
This flexibility is useful for legacy systems or specific format needs, though users should note potential format-specific limitations, especially with older Excel versions.

#### Deprecation and Migration Advice
A critical point is PHPExcel's deprecation. Research shows it was archived in 2019, with the last update in 2015, and is no longer maintained. This raises concerns about security vulnerabilities and compatibility with PHP versions beyond 7.0, especially with modern standards like PHP 8.x. The GitHub repository and Packagist page both recommend migrating to PhpSpreadsheet, which offers namespaces, PSR compliance, and active development.

For users, this means:
- For existing projects using PHPExcel 1.8, continue with caution, ensuring testing for security and compatibility.
- For new projects, strongly consider PhpSpreadsheet, with migration tools available, as noted in the PhpSpreadsheet documentation ([Migration from PHPExcel](https://phpspreadsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/migration-from-PHPExcel/)).

This advice is particularly relevant given the current date, ensuring users align with modern, supported libraries.

#### Documentation and Further Learning
For deeper exploration, the official documentation for PHPExcel is available in its GitHub repository under the Documentation folder, though access may require downloading files like the developer documentation DOC. Online, tutorials like the one on SitePoint ([Generate Excel Files and Charts with PHPExcel](https://www.sitepoint.com/generate-excel-files-charts-phpexcel/)) provide practical examples, covering charts and formatting, which extend beyond basic usage. Stack Overflow threads also offer community insights, though care should be taken with outdated answers given the library's status.

#### Comparative Table: PHPExcel vs. PhpSpreadsheet
