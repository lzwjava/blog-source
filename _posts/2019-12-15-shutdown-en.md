Dear Shareholders,

Since the company was established in July 2016, we have operated for over three years. I would like to report to you on the situation.

The past two years' business, you are all well informed. This year, we have completed the settlement of some software outsourcing projects from the end of last year and the beginning of this year. At the same time, we have tried to transform and develop by operating some intermediary businesses for introducing outsourcing services to friend companies. We have also spent a considerable amount of time thinking, summarizing, and looking forward to the future, to see if there is any business that can be developed and strengthened for the long term.1. In a transitional period, this year's performance declined with revenue around 30万 and net profit around 10万. The company's total assets amounted to 39万. In comparison, the revenue was approximately 250万 in 2019, with a net profit of around 40万. The company's total assets were around 40万 at the end of the year.

2. The concepts of revenue, gross profit, and net profit used here are slightly different. Revenue refers to the total sales revenue. Gross profit is calculated by deducting salaries or expenses for all employees except the founder, part-time employees, and downstream cooperative companies. Net profit, on the other hand, is calculated by deducting the founder's salary, company rent, cloud computing services, office rental, and accounting outsourcing fees from gross profit. The founder bears most of the responsibility and incurs significant personal expenses without company reimbursement. Reporting business expenses as living expenses to the company is done to avoid taxes. We have used many part-time employees in outsourcing business, and their salaries are reported to the company through the founder's invoices, which are then privately paid to the part-time employees. When invoices are insufficient, additional wages are paid to the founder, which are then deducted as personal tax expenses.

3. From Mr. Li Xiao's book "Investing to Change Your Destiny," I learned about operating a blockchain fund, which went through five years of hardship and near-death experiences, only to find that the performance growth was still insufficient compared to Bitcoin. This feeling is similar to my experience of operating a company for three years.

4. I began working in 2014, and have been working for five years and some change. The first five years in Beijing were a low-budget struggle story. In 2015, I worked as an engineer and earned around 15万, saving 8万. In the first half of 2016, I started a business with a friend, but it lasted only half a year. I then started my own business, which lasted for half a year, with revenue of around 7万, expenses of approximately 18万, and a loss of 11万, leaving me with less than 1万 in savings. At the end of 2017, I started the business with a 55万 investment, paid off my parents' debts of 7万, earned 10万, and had expenses of around 50万, leaving the company with a total asset value of approximately 5万. In 2018, I worked hard and, as mentioned above.

These experiences make me frequently reflect: Am I not trying hard enough? What is the real reason? Why, after five years of struggle, do I still have nothing? Over the past five years, I calculated that I actually incurred a loss. I barely managed to sustain myself. Is it my problem, or is there something wrong with the world? Why, despite being admitted to 211 University and being relatively active, do I find it difficult to survive in society? I have reflected personally and analyzed a lot. Let's talk about social issues. A significant portion of consumption in cities contributes to real estate, with high prices leading to high consumption in all areas. A portion of my daily consumption goes to rent. Another portion goes to dining, local services, transportation, and the prices of these items also include rent costs. Everyone needs a house to live, either by owning or renting, so they must have higher income to sustain themselves, forcing them to raise the prices of their goods and services. Therefore, consumption is high in Beijing.

Yes, every year, rent takes up over 30% of my expenses. When starting a business, you'll find that a 9-person office requires a monthly rent of 13,000 yuan. When I thought it was inconvenient for my employees to order food and wanted to treat them better, we had 9 people eating takeout every month, which cost over 10,000 yuan. In high-priced areas, a significant portion of expenses goes to the government and landlords. The rent and the high prices it causes may account for over 50% of monthly income.

At the same time, I have observed modern life, where we have become increasingly dependent on others, leading to the evolution of delivery services and various door-to-door services. However, these product and service providers raise their prices layer by layer, making them less affordable. You pay not only for the labor in that box of food but also for Meituan's marketing costs, software employee wages, and delivery fees. As a busy entrepreneur, I often order takeout, spending 35 yuan per meal and 70 yuan per day, totaling 2,100 yuan per month. When I had more free time, I cooked for myself, spending only 200 yen per week on groceries, or approximately 900 yen per month. After getting used to takeout, I often went out to eat, increasing my monthly food expenses to 3,000 yen. In a capitalist society, division of labor is taken to the extreme, increasing production efficiency but also raising costs because each layer needs to survive and add a markup. Meituan gradually increased merchants' commission fees because it started to make a profit. In the United States, capitalism has developed to a higher stage, labor is very expensive, and I have seen many American families trying to do as much work themselves, such as fixing toilets and cars.

Furthermore, I have observed that earning a living and spending money on consumption have been separated in modern society, making people less aware of the labor behind their consumption. For example, a movie ticket costs 60 yuan, which seems enjoyable to spend money, but it actually means you need to cook 6 fast-food meals for someone else to obtain it. The more money you spend, the more labor you need to provide. If I had to spend two hours cooking 6 fast-food meals to watch a movie, I wouldn't watch it. However, spending money seems enjoyable, and I don't consider the labor behind it. Consequently, city dwellers spend more and more. Money is indeed comfortable, and many desires can be instantly satisfied.

When I worked until 9 pm every day, I couldn't see the future; all I could see was working for 20-30 years and buying a house in the city. Later, I started my own business. Entrepreneurship made life more hectic, and it became more difficult. I saw that the internet industry actually enjoyed significant benefits, with a lot of money flowing into society and many companies receiving high salaries for their employees. However, these companies could not escape the market's hidden hand. Their landlords, employees, advertising service providers, and even if they were internet companies, they did not receive discounts or favors from them, as everyone needs to survive and demand the best deal. Consequently, companies ran out of money and suffered significant stock price drops.1. The features of internet platforms make it so only big players can participate, unlike the restaurant industry with numerous scattered small businesses. Small to medium-sized internet companies struggle.

2. I began to understand the tricks of entrepreneurs, how to run a successful company. A successful company is a meticulous one, aiming to maximize income and minimize costs. It requires clear accounting. It operates like the market and treats everyone like users - "if you're not needed, you're not needed"; "a loss of a few million or even billions in the stock market determines your loss." Everything is for the best interest, ruthless. Therefore, a successful entrepreneur is strict with employees and demands precision. They select the most reliable and powerful people, pushing everyone to their limits, at least keeping the company from losing money, and eventually earning a profit. Of course, the internet industry has its own play, first requiring connections and funding, then producing a good product and attracting users, and finally going public to cash out. However, the risks are enormous and unexpected, and most ultimately collapse.

3. A company rents an office space for 6000 yuan a year, hires an accounting firm for 3700 yuan, and taxes are not small. A recent blog post by a media blogger, Yulin from Self-Media, received many comments about heavy taxes. Indeed, I tried every legal way to avoid taxes, but I still paid a considerable amount.

4. I used to think that being a successful entrepreneur meant growing and strengthening a company. But I found that the most excellent are not easy to come by. Generally, one has to struggle until 50 to feel relatively secure. Those most successful internet entrepreneurs took their companies public around 40, but even then, it took 5-10 years to stabilize profits. The stock market is merciless; poor financial reports cause stocks to plummet. The founder's stock holdings are exposed, and if they sell in a bad market, the company's situation will be dire.

5. School, work, entrepreneurship - why is life becoming increasingly difficult? There are so many intelligent people and high technology, but everyone must work hard for a lifetime, and life is not becoming simpler. I think, in big cities, there are people with more than two houses as assets, government officials, evictees, and veteran players in the financial industry. For them, life is relatively easier.

So, what can be done? Housing is a big issue. I plan to go back to Guangzhou, to my parents' place. In 2010, they bought a house relatively cheaply there. Now they rent it out, and next year they might consider not renting it out anymore. When I was taking the college entrance exam, I chose to stay in this school to finish high school, and the school rewarded me with 20,000 yuan, which I gave to my parents. They didn't live there, so I planned to live there instead, which wasn't much, not a big deal.

Secondly, I will try to live as self-sufficiently as possible, creating what I need through labor. My mom works near a garden, and my mom grows some vegetables. I plan to learn how to do it myself, reducing my dependence on society as much as possible.

This way, I'll see how much I spend in a year and how much I depend on others. I see this method will be a bit hard. But everything hard is for myself, not for others, not forced. It's not like starting a business or working, which is for serving others. Self-sufficient living has a sense of accomplishment. It's like cooking for myself, making soy milk, brewing tea, and making snacks.

At the same time, it means no middlemen making a profit, and in most cases, it means the most efficient way to meet my needs. I will use my remaining time to learn, read, and think.: Therefore, shareholders, I propose to liquidate the company. I'm just suggesting, feel free to give your opinions.

I have thought of two plans:

1. With 55 million in funding, during liquidation, 50% is paid back immediately, and the remaining 50% is agreed to be repaid within 5 years. The company's assets are currently 39 million, 27.5 million for Laughing Come and Lei Fei shareholders, and the remaining 11.5 million for Zhiwei. Zhiwei should repay the two shareholders 27.5 million within 5 years.
2. With 55 million in funding, during liquidation, 50% is paid back immediately, and the remaining 50% is not required to be repaid. The remaining 11.5 million is considered Zhiwei's earnings from his years of hard work in starting the business.

I know everyone earns money hard, and as we experience more in society, we realize how difficult it is for parents. I'm very grateful to every person who supports me. When I hate those who caused me losses, those who took advantage of me, those who didn't work hard and didn't pay me back, and those who completely cheated me, I appreciate those who have been kind to me even more. I'm sorry that, despite my past promises to make a lot of money for the shareholders, unfortunately, I don't have that ability at the moment.

Sincerely, Li Zhiwei
