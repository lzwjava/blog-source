title: "ChatGPT Helps Me Learn the Japanese Song 真夜中のドア"
---

Let's learn Japanese as writing code. Though we here write an article, the way we are writing it is the same as writing code. We do some Google searches or ChatGPT asking to write one paragraph, like writing one method in the code.

There is a famous Japanese song "真夜中のドア".  What does it mean? 真夜中 means midnight. The English translation of 真夜中 is Mayonaka.  の like the Chinese word "的". It is a particle word. 

There are two good websites to learn Japanese. We can search for the meaning of the words at https://jisho.org.  We can get the pronunciation at https://ja.forvo.com. 

And ドア sounds like "dowa". And ドア means door. So "真夜中のドア" means the door at midnight. Let's learn it by ChatGPT.

Zhiwei: What does 真夜中のドア mean? 

ChatGPT: 

The phrase "真夜中のドア" translates to "Midnight Door" or "Door of Midnight" in English.
Here's a breakdown of the components:

1. 真夜中 (まよなか) - "Midnight"
   - 真 (ま) means "true" or "real."
   - 夜 (よ) means "night."
   - 中 (なか) means "middle" or "in the middle of."

2. ドア - "Door" (borrowed from English)

So, "真夜中のドア" represents a door in the middle of the night, implying an atmospheric and mysterious setting often associated with nighttime encounters, secrets, or new beginnings. It is also the title of a famous Japanese song, as mentioned earlier.

Zhiwei: What does the literal English pronunciation of "真夜中のドア"? 

ChatGPT:

The literal English pronunciation of "真夜中のドア" is:

"Ma" (as in "mah")
"yo" (as in "yo"ga)
"na" (as in "na"p)
"ka" (as in "ka"t)
no (as in "no"te)
"do" (as in "do"g)
"a" (as in "a"rt)

So, it would be pronounced as "Mah-yo-na-ka no do-a" in English.

Zhiwei: What are the keystrokes I need to type to input into the macOS system? 

ChatGPT: To type "真夜中のドア" on a macOS system, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your input method is set to Japanese Hiragana or Katakana.

2. Type the following key sequences using the Roman alphabet letters:

   "mayonaka no doa"

3. As you type each sequence, the macOS system should automatically convert it to the corresponding Japanese characters "真夜中のドア."

For example, when you type "ma," it will be converted to "ま" (hiragana character for "ma"). When you type "yo," it will be converted to "よ" (hiragana character for "yo"), and so on.

Please note that the exact method and input settings may vary slightly depending on your macOS version and keyboard settings, but these general steps should work for most Japanese input methods on macOS.
