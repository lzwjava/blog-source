title: "ChatGPT Helps Me Learn Japanese"
---

Let's learn Japanese as writing code. Though we here write an article, the way we are writing it is the same as writing code. We do some Google searches or ChatGPT asking to write one paragraph, like writing one method in the code.

There is a famous Japanese song "真夜中のドア".  What does it mean? 真夜中 means midnight. The English translation of 真夜中 is Mayonaka.  の like the Chinese word "的". It is a particle word. 

There are two good websites to learn Japanese. We can search for the meaning of the words at https://jisho.org.  We can get the pronunciation at https://ja.forvo.com. 

And ドア sounds like "dowa". And ドア means door. So "真夜中のドア" means the door at midnight. Let's learn it by ChatGPT.

Zhiwei: What does 真夜中のドア mean? 

ChatGPT: The phrase "真夜中のドア" translates to "Midnight Door" or "Door of Midnight" in English.
Here's a breakdown of the components:

1. 真夜中 (まよなか) - "Midnight"
   - 真 (ま) means "true" or "real."
   - 夜 (よ) means "night."
   - 中 (なか) means "middle" or "in the middle of."

2. ドア - "Door" (borrowed from English)

So, "真夜中のドア" represents a door in the middle of the night, implying an atmospheric and mysterious setting often associated with nighttime encounters, secrets, or new beginnings. It is also the title of a famous Japanese song, as mentioned earlier.

Zhiwei: What does the literal English pronunciation of "真夜中のドア"? 

ChatGPT: The literal English pronunciation of "真夜中のドア" is:

"Ma" (as in "mah")
"yo" (as in "yo"ga)
"na" (as in "na"p)
"ka" (as in "ka"t)
no (as in "no"te)
"do" (as in "do"g)
"a" (as in "a"rt)

So, it would be pronounced as "Mah-yo-na-ka no do-a" in English.

Zhiwei: What are the keystrokes I need to type to input into the macOS system? 

ChatGPT: To type "真夜中のドア" on a macOS system, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your input method is set to Japanese Hiragana or Katakana.
2. Type the following key sequences using the Roman alphabet letters:
   "mayonaka no doa"
3. As you type each sequence, the macOS system should automatically convert it to the corresponding Japanese characters "真夜中のドア."

For example, when you type "ma," it will be converted to "ま" (hiragana character for "ma"). When you type "yo," it will be converted to "よ" (hiragana character for "yo"), and so on.

Please note that the exact method and input settings may vary slightly depending on your macOS version and keyboard settings, but these general steps should work for most Japanese input methods on macOS.

Let me try it. 真夜中のドア. Yeah, it is so simple. 真夜中のドア. Let's show the input method setting in the MacOS system.

Zhiwei: could you explain these lyrics to me ?

"私は私 貴方は貴方と
昨夜言ってた そんな気もするわ"

ChatGPT: Certainly! These lyrics are written in Japanese and can be translated into English as follows:

"私は私 貴方は貴方と
昨夜言ってた そんな気もするわ"

In English:

"I am myself, and you are yourself
That's what I said last night, I think"

Let's break it down:

1. 私は私 (わたしは わたし) - "I am myself": This line emphasizes individuality and self-identity, stating that "I" am just "myself," and not trying to be anyone else.

2. 貴方は貴方と (あなたは あなたと) - "You are yourself": Similar to the previous line, this emphasizes that "you" are simply "yourself," and not someone else.

3. 昨夜言ってた (ゆうべ いってた) - "That's what I said last night": This line suggests that the speaker expressed these thoughts or sentiments the night before.

4. そんな気もするわ (そんなき もするわ) - "I think that way too" or "I feel the same way": The speaker acknowledges that they also feel the same about the individuality and identities of both "I" and "you."

Overall, these lyrics seem to express a sense of acceptance and understanding of individuality, as well as a reflection on a conversation or realization from the previous night. The repetition of "私は私" and "貴方は貴方と" emphasizes the idea of staying true to one's self and recognizing the uniqueness of each person.

Zhiwei: Thanks. Could you spell the word "私は私 (わたしは わたし) " to me?

ChatGPT: Certainly! The word "私は私" spelled phonetically in romaji is:

"Watashi wa watashi"

---

Zhiwei: Spell the word "貴方は貴方と (あなたは あなたと) ".

ChatGPT: Sure! The word "貴方は貴方と" spelled phonetically in romaji is:

"Anata wa anata to"

---

Zhiwei: Cool. It is really simple. Could you spell the word "昨夜言ってた (ゆうべ いってた) "?

ChatGPT: Certainly! The word "昨夜言ってた" spelled phonetically in romaji is:

"Yuube itteta"

---

Zhiwei: Could you explain why?

ChatGPT: Of course! Let's break down the word "昨夜言ってた" and understand its phonetic spelling in romaji:

1. 昨夜 (ゆうべ) - "Yuube": This means "last night." It is pronounced as "yuu-be."

2. 言ってた (いってた) - "itteta": This is a contraction of two Japanese words: "言って" (itte) and "た" (ta).

   - 言って (いって) - "itte": This is the te-form of the verb "言う" (iu), which means "to say" or "to speak." The te-form is used to connect verbs or express continuous actions.
   - た (ta): This is a past tense marker in Japanese, which indicates that the action of the verb occurred in the past.

Putting it together, "言ってた" (itteta) means "said" or "was saying" in English.

So, "昨夜言ってた" (Yuube itteta) translates to "Last night, I said" or "Last night, I was saying" in English. It refers to a past action of speaking or saying something that occurred the previous night.

Zhiwei: Thanks. It is clearer now. Does っ in いって mean the t? 

ChatGPT: You're welcome! I'm glad it's clearer now.

In the word "いって" (itte), the small っ (sokuon) does not represent the sound "t" itself, but it affects the pronunciation of the following consonant. In this case, it affects the pronunciation of the "t" sound.

In Japanese, when you see a small っ (sokuon) before certain consonants (k, s, t, h, or sometimes p), it indicates a slight pause or stop in the pronunciation of the consonant that follows. It's as if you're momentarily holding back the airflow before saying the consonant, resulting in a more emphasized or staccato sound.

So in "いって" (itte):

1. The "い" (i) is pronounced normally as "ee" in "see."
2. The small っ (sokuon) causes a brief pause or stop before the "t" sound.
3. The "て" (te) is then pronounced with an emphasized "t" sound, similar to the "t" in "top" or "tap."

Overall, "いって" (itte) is pronounced as "ee-t-te" in English, with the "t" sound emphasized due to the sokuon.

Zhiwei: What does staccato mean? 

ChatGPT: "Staccato" is a musical term that describes a style of playing or singing where each note is sharply and distinctly separated from the next. It is the opposite of legato, which means smoothly connecting the notes.

In staccato, the duration of each note is intentionally shortened, creating a crisp and detached sound. It is often denoted by a dot placed above or below the note, or sometimes by a short vertical line placed above or below the note.

Staccato is commonly used in various forms of music, including classical, jazz, and contemporary styles. It can add a lively and rhythmic element to the music, creating a more percussive or playful effect. In some cases, staccato notes might be performed with a slight accent, further emphasizing the separation between the notes.

The term "staccato" originates from the Italian word "staccare," which means "to detach" or "to separate." It is widely used in music notation and performance instructions to indicate the specific articulation desired by the composer or conductor.

Zhiwei: Sorry, it is difficult to understand. I will skip it. Could you spell the sentence "そんな気もするわ (そんなき もするわ) "?

ChatGPT: Sure! The sentence "そんな気もするわ" spelled phonetically in romaji is:

"Sonna ki mo suru wa"

---

Zhiwei: Could you explain?

ChatGPT: Certainly! Let's break down the sentence "そんな気もするわ" and understand its phonetic spelling in romaji:

1. そんな (sonna) - "such" or "that kind of": This is a demonstrative pronoun used to refer to something that is nearby in context or known to both the speaker and the listener. It can be translated as "such" or "that kind of" in English.

2. 気 (き) - "ki": This can be translated as "feeling," "sensation," or "mood." It refers to one's state of mind or emotions.

3. も (mo) - "mo": This particle is used to indicate emphasis and can be translated as "also" or "even."

4. する (suru) - "suru": This is the plain form of the verb "する" (suru), which means "to do" or "to feel." In this context, it conveys the idea of "to feel."

5. わ (wa) - "wa": This is a sentence-ending particle used to add a sense of feminine emphasis or mild assertion to the statement.

Putting it together, "そんな気もするわ" (Sonna ki mo suru wa) can be translated as "I feel that way too" or "I also have that kind of feeling" in English. It expresses agreement or similarity in feelings or thoughts with someone else, emphasizing that the speaker shares a similar sentiment. The sentence-ending particle "わ" adds a gentle and feminine touch to the statement.

Zhiwei: Really awesome! So good! Could you explain "グレイのジャケットに" too? 

ChatGPT: Certainly! Let's break down the phrase "グレイのジャケットに" and understand its meaning:

1. グレイ (gurei) - "gray": This is the Japanese word for the color "gray."

2. の (no) - "no": This is a particle that indicates possession or association. It is similar to the English word "of."

3. ジャケット (jaketto) - "jacket": This is the Japanese word borrowed from English for a "jacket," referring to a type of outerwear typically worn over clothes.

4. に (ni) - "ni": This is a particle with multiple uses in Japanese, but in this context, it indicates the target or direction of an action. It can be translated as "to" or "in" in English.

Putting it together, "グレイのジャケットに" (gurei no jaketto ni) can be translated as "in a gray jacket" or "to a gray jacket" in English, depending on the context. It describes the color and type of jacket someone is wearing or the jacket someone is referring to in a conversation. The "に" particle indicates the direction or location of the jacket in relation to the action or context of the sentence.

Zhiwei: Could you explain how "ジャケット" relates to jaketto in prounciation? 

ChatGPT: I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. I made an error in my phonetic transcriptions. Let me clarify:

"ジャケット" (jaketto) is the Japanese word borrowed from the English term "jacket." In the Japanese writing system, Katakana is used to represent foreign words, including English words. The Katakana characters "ジャ" (ja) and "ケット" (ketto) together form the word "ジャケット" (jaketto).

The pronunciation of "ジャケット" in Japanese closely resembles the English word "jacket," but with a slight Japanese accent. Here's a breakdown of the pronunciation:

1. ジャ (ja): The "ジャ" (ja) sound is pronounced similarly to the English "ja" in "jar" or "jazz."

2. ケット (ketto): The "ケット" (ketto) sound is pronounced similar to the English "ket" in "ketone" or "ketosis," but with a softer "t" sound.

Overall, "ジャケット" (jaketto) in Japanese sounds very similar to the English word "jacket," with a slight difference in the "t" sound. The borrowed term "ジャケット" is commonly used in Japanese to refer to various styles of jackets, just as the English word "jacket" is used in English.
