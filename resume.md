## Profiles

* I am an engineer, scientist, startup founder, blogger, and lifelong learner. I had tracks of excellence in my 28 years of life. I ranked in the top 300 in NOIP(National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces) in Guangdong Provinces in my high school. After my first year at Beijing Forestry University(Top 100 of 3000 universities in China), I dropped out to work in a startup and then created my one. Over three years in the startup industry, I constructed an engineering live broadcast platform that served 30,000 users and led a team to complete 50 small software projects around a year, generating an annual revenue of 3 million CNY. In my last job, I worked as a contractor for one of the largest banking and financial services institutions in the world, HSBC Bank.
* Regarding my technical experience, I have accumulated approximately nine years of software engineering experience, working across different domains such as iOS, Android, frontend, and backend development. Additionally, I dedicated around one year to exploring the field of machine learning, which I pursued during my leisure time and freelance periods. In addition, I have achieved proficiency in English, having obtained a score of 6 on the IELTS exam.
* Because of my benevolent and honest personality, I am an easy-going, reliable, and joyful guy who gets along with people well.
