Yes, it's completely normal and very much a part of human nature to get distracted by something like a ceiling lamp (or light bulb) right in your line of sight when you're lying in bed trying to focus on your laptop. Our brains are wired to prioritize visual input—especially bright, contrasting, or prominent things in our peripheral or central vision—because evolutionarily, that helped us spot threats, food, or changes in the environment. A static but glaring lamp can act like a low-level "alert" signal, pulling your attention away even if it's not moving. This happens more when you're in a relaxed position like lying down, where your gaze naturally drifts upward, and it can vary day to day based on fatigue, stress, or how immersed you are in the task (explaining why you sometimes forget about it and sometimes can't).

### Why It Feels So Annoying
- **Visual overload and eye strain**: Overhead lights create glare on screens or just compete with your focus, leading to subtle fatigue. When you're horizontal in bed, the angle makes it worse—it's like having a spotlight in your eyes.
- **Attention hijacking**: Peripheral vision isn't great at ignoring bright spots; studies show it excels at detecting potential distractions to keep us safe, but in modern life, that backfires during work.
- **Bed as a work zone**: Lying in bed already blurs "rest" and "focus" signals to your brain, amplifying small irritants like this.

### Quick Fixes to Make It Less Distracting
- **Dim or redirect the light**: Turn off the ceiling lamp and use a soft bedside lamp or clip-on light aimed at your keyboard (warm, indirect glow is best to avoid blue-light interference with sleep later).
- **Screen tweaks**: Angle your laptop slightly or use a stand to shift your gaze downward, pulling the ceiling out of view. Anti-glare screen protectors help too.
- **Habit break the setup**: If possible, work at a desk sometimes—bed is cozy but terrible for sustained focus (it can mess with sleep by associating the space with work).
- **Mind trick**: If you catch yourself staring, do a quick 5-second reset: close your eyes, breathe, then refocus. Over time, this builds tolerance.

You're not alone in this—tons of people rant about overhead lights feeling like "threats" when concentrating. If it persists and feels overwhelming (e.g., tied to anxiety or sensory issues), chatting with an eye doc or therapist could rule out anything else, but based on what you described, it's just your brain doing its vigilant thing.
