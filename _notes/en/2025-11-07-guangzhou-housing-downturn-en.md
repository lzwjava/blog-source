I'm really sorry to hear about your situation—that's a brutal hit, especially after putting money into what was supposed to be a stable investment. A 50% drop in value over three years is heartbreaking, and it's hitting a lot of folks in Guangzhou hard. You're not alone; the city's secondary housing market (which sounds like where your property sits) has seen sharper declines than new builds, with resale prices down around 5-6% year-over-year as of early 2025, and cumulative drops from 2022 peaks estimated at 20-40% depending on the neighborhood and property type. Some areas with oversupply have fared worse, which might explain the steeper hit you're seeing.

As for "who to blame," it's not one villain—it's a perfect storm of systemic issues that built up over years and crashed down since 2021-2022. Here's a breakdown of the main culprits, based on what's been driving the slump in Guangzhou and across China:

- **Overleveraged developers and the debt bubble burst**: Companies like Evergrande (headquartered in Guangzhou, no less) borrowed wildly to build too much, too fast. When Evergrande defaulted in late 2021 with over $300 billion in liabilities, it triggered a domino effect—projects stalled, buyers got spooked, and inventory piled up. Guangzhou, as a developer hub, felt this acutely, with unfinished homes eroding confidence and dragging resale values.

- **Government crackdowns on speculation**: Beijing's "three red lines" policy in 2020 capped developer borrowing to cool a housing bubble fueled by investor speculation. Add purchase restrictions, high down payments (up to 60% in some cases), and mortgage curbs, and demand dried up overnight. These were meant to make housing more affordable long-term, but they slammed the brakes too hard, especially in first-tier cities like Guangzhou where prices had tripled in a decade.

- **Oversupply from years of overbuilding**: China built like crazy in the 2010s to boost GDP—Guangzhou alone has millions of square meters of unsold stock. By 2025, excess inventory is still around 400 million sqm nationwide, flooding the market and forcing price cuts to move units.

- **Broader economic headwinds**: COVID lockdowns hammered growth, youth unemployment hit 16-17% in 2024-2025, and household debt soared to 145% of disposable income. With slower job growth and uncertainty, fewer young buyers are jumping in, especially for secondary homes. Guangzhou's export-reliant economy didn't help, as global trade softened.

- **Lagging policy responses**: Stimulus like rate cuts (mortgages down to ~3% by 2025) and eased buying rules in Guangzhou helped a bit—new home sales stabilized slightly this year—but it's been too patchy and slow to rebuild trust. Prices are still sliding in most cities, though first-tier spots like yours show faint signs of bottoming out.

In short, blame the cycle: a mix of greedy developers, heavy-handed regulators, and an economy in transition. It's less about individual fault and more about a market correcting after unsustainable growth. If you're holding, some analysts see stabilization by 2026 with more targeted support, but resale liquidity is low right now. I'd suggest chatting with a local agent or financial advisor in Guangzhou for your specific property—they can run comps and explore options like renting it out. Hang in there; these slumps eventually turn, but it's rough in the meantime.
