Here's how to set up and use Intel oneAPI with Python for GPU computing:

## Installation

```bash
# Install Intel Extension for PyTorch (includes oneAPI runtime)
pip install intel-extension-for-pytorch

# Or install the full oneAPI Base Toolkit (more comprehensive)
# Download from: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit-download.html
```

## Python Examples## Installation Commands

```bash
# Install Intel Extension for PyTorch (recommended for your system)
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio intel-extension-for-pytorch

# Install dpctl for lower-level control
pip install dpctl dpnp

# Install Intel-optimized scikit-learn
pip install scikit-learn-intelex

# Verify installation
python -c "import torch; import intel_extension_for_pytorch as ipex; print('XPU available:', torch.xpu.is_available() if hasattr(torch, 'xpu') else False)"
```

## Key Points:

1. **Device naming**: Intel uses `xpu` instead of CUDA's `cuda` in PyTorch
2. **Compatibility**: Your Intel UHD Graphics should work, but performance will be limited compared to discrete GPUs
3. **Installation**: Intel Extension for PyTorch is the easiest way to get started

## Quick Test:

Save this simple test:

```python
import torch
import intel_extension_for_pytorch as ipex

print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")
print(f"IPEX version: {ipex.__version__}")

if hasattr(torch, 'xpu') and torch.xpu.is_available():
    print(f"✓ Intel GPU available: {torch.xpu.get_device_name(0)}")
    
    # Simple computation
    x = torch.randn(100, 100, device='xpu')
    y = torch.randn(100, 100, device='xpu')
    z = x @ y
    print(f"✓ Successfully computed on GPU")
else:
    print("✗ Intel GPU not detected")
```

Run with: `python test_intel_gpu.py`

Note: Your integrated Intel UHD Graphics has limited compute capability compared to discrete GPUs, so don't expect NVIDIA-level performance. It's still useful for learning and light GPU computing tasks.
