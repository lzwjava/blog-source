While it's not entirely accurate to say that pepper sauce *never* gets moldy, it is quite resistant to mold growth due to a few key factors:

* **High Acidity:** Vinegar, a primary ingredient in many pepper sauces, has a low pH (high acidity). This acidic environment inhibits the growth of most molds and bacteria. Acetic acid, the main component of vinegar, is a well-known preservative that kills microbes and prevents spoilage.
* **Presence of Chili Peppers:** Chili peppers contain capsaicin, the compound responsible for their heat. Studies have shown that capsaicin has antimicrobial properties, meaning it can help to prevent the growth of bacteria and some fungi.
* **Salt Content:** Many pepper sauce recipes include salt, which acts as another natural preservative by drawing out moisture that microorganisms need to thrive.
* **Sugar Content (in some sauces):** While high sugar content can sometimes feed mold, in pepper sauces, the sugar is usually present in smaller amounts and works in conjunction with the other preservatives.
* **Processing and Packaging:** Commercial pepper sauces often undergo heat processing during manufacturing, which helps to kill any existing microorganisms. Proper sealing of the bottles also prevents new contaminants from entering.

**However, it's important to note that pepper sauce can still spoil under certain conditions:**

* **Low Acidity:** If a pepper sauce has a low vinegar content or includes a lot of non-acidic ingredients (like certain fruits or vegetables), it will be more susceptible to mold.
* **Contamination:** Introducing bacteria or mold through contaminated utensils or by dipping food directly into the bottle can lead to spoilage. Keeping the bottle rim clean and always pouring the sauce out rather than dipping can help prevent this.
* **Improper Storage:** While unopened pepper sauce can usually be stored at room temperature in a cool, dark place, once opened, refrigeration is often recommended to extend its shelf life, especially for sauces with lower acidity or added perishable ingredients. Exposure to light and heat can also degrade the sauce over time.

So, while pepper sauce has natural defenses against mold due to its ingredients, it's not immune. Proper storage and handling are still important to maintain its quality and prevent spoilage. If you notice any changes in color, smell, or texture, or if mold appears, it's best to discard the sauce.
