### IBM DB2 SQLCODE -551: Authorization Failure (Missing SELECT Privilege)

**What it means**: SQLCODE -551 is an authorization error in IBM DB2, indicating that the current user or application lacks the necessary privileges to perform a specified operation on one or more database objects. In your case, "missing select privilege" highlights a lack of SELECT access, meaning the user can't query (read) the targeted table, view, or database object.

**Common causes**:
- The user isn't granted the SELECT privilege on the object (e.g., via `GRANT SELECT ON table_name TO user_name`).
- Use of a shared connection with restricted roles or insufficient authority.
- Attempts to query system objects or restricted views without proper permissions.
- Issues with implicit privileges (e.g., through roles or groups that don't include SELECT).

**How to diagnose**:
- Check the full error message in logs or from `db2 diag`/`db2 ? SQLCODE -551` for specifics on the objected affected.
- Verify user privileges using DB2 commands like `db2 "GET AUTHORIZATIONS"` or querying syscat tables (e.g., SYSCAT.TABAUTH for table privileges).

**Resolution steps**:
1. **Grant privileges**: An administrator should run `GRANT SELECT ON object_name TO user_name [WITH GRANT OPTION]` (replace with actual object and user).
2. **Check roles/groups**: Ensure the user is in a group or role with SELECT access.
3. **Test with elevated access**: If using DB2 CLP, connect as a privileged user (e.g., DBADM).
4. **Review security policies**: Consult DB2 security docs (IBM Knowledge Center) for role-based access control (RBAC) configurations.
5. If persistent, restart DB2 or audit connection settings.

This error prioritizes security, preventing unauthorized data access. For complex setups, escalate to your DBA. Reference: IBM DB2 SQL Messages and Codes manual.
