The ability to use the `code chat "hi"` command to open the GitHub Copilot chat window in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is tied to the broader integration of GitHub Copilot Chat and its associated features, such as the Chat view and related commands. Based on available information, here’s the analysis:

### Release of the `code chat` Command
The `code chat` command is not explicitly mentioned in the provided release notes for VS Code, but it is closely related to the GitHub Copilot Chat functionality, which has been progressively enhanced across multiple VS Code releases. The command is likely an alias or shorthand for invoking the Copilot Chat view or inline chat, which became prominent with the introduction of Copilot Chat features.

- **GitHub Copilot Chat Integration**: The Copilot Chat feature, including the Chat view, was significantly developed and highlighted in releases starting around August 2023 (VS Code version 1.82) and continued to evolve through subsequent versions, including 1.99 (March 2025). The Chat view and related commands like `Chat: Open Chat` or inline chat commands were introduced and refined during this period.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93)[](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_86)
- **Command Palette and Chat Commands**: By the November 2024 release (version 1.96), VS Code had introduced features like moving from the Chat view to Copilot Edits and improved context handling in the Chat view, indicating robust support for chat-related commands. The ability to trigger Copilot Chat via commands from the Command Palette was already in place, and the `code chat` command likely emerged as part of these enhancements.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_96)
- **Specific to Version 1.99.2**: The March 2025 release (version 1.99) and its updates (1.99.2 and 1.99.3) do not explicitly mention the `code chat "hi"` command. However, they do discuss advancements in the Copilot Chat experience, such as custom chat modes, agent mode, and improved context handling, which suggest that chat-related commands were well-supported by this time. The `code chat` command, if not explicitly documented, would likely be available as part of the Command Palette’s integration with Copilot Chat.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_99)

### When Was the `code chat "hi"` Function Released?
While the exact release of the `code chat "hi"` command is not pinpointed in the provided notes, it is reasonable to infer that it was available by the time of the March 2025 release (version 1.99) or earlier, given the mature state of Copilot Chat features. The command likely leverages the existing infrastructure for opening the Chat view, which was well-established by version 1.96 (November 2024) with commands like `Chat: Open Chat` or `Open Quick Chat`.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_96)[](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93)

- **Earliest Likely Release**: The Copilot Chat functionality, including the ability to open the Chat view via commands, was significantly developed by August 2024 (version 1.93) with features like Quick Chat and context improvements. The `code chat` command could have been introduced around this time or shortly after as part of the Command Palette’s integration with Copilot.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93)
- **Confirmation for 1.99.2**: By version 1.99.2 (March 2025), the Copilot Chat system was mature, with support for custom modes, agent mode, and context variables like `#codebase`. The `code chat "hi"` command, which opens the Chat view with a prompt like "hi," would likely be supported as a standard command in the Command Palette, given the advanced state of chat functionality.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_99)

### Conclusion
The `code chat "hi"` command to open the Copilot Chat window was likely available by the March 2025 release (version 1.99) or earlier, possibly as early as August 2024 (version 1.93), when Copilot Chat features were significantly enhanced. For version 1.99.2 specifically, the command would almost certainly be functional, as the Chat view and related commands were well-integrated by this point. If you need precise confirmation, you can check the Command Palette in VS Code 1.99.2 by typing `code chat` to see if it appears as a valid command.
