Leo Breiman (1928–2005) was an American statistician and a pioneer in the field of machine learning. He is best known for developing key statistical and machine learning techniques, including:

- **CART (Classification and Regression Trees):** Breiman introduced the CART algorithm, a foundational method for decision tree learning, widely used in data science and machine learning for classification and regression tasks.
- **Random Forests:** He developed the random forest algorithm, an ensemble learning method that improves predictive accuracy by combining multiple decision trees, now a staple in machine learning.
- **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):** Breiman proposed bagging, a technique to reduce variance in predictive models by averaging predictions from multiple bootstrapped samples.

Breiman was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and his work emphasized practical, data-driven approaches over purely theoretical models. His 2001 paper, "Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures," highlighted the divide between traditional statistical modeling and machine learning’s focus on predictive accuracy, advocating for the latter.

He also made contributions to probability theory and applied statistics, with earlier work in areas like optimal gambling strategies. Breiman’s innovations have had a lasting impact on modern data science.
