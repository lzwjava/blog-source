Here’s how to check if your Apple TV is powered on, especially when the indicator light is not obvious:

---

### 1. **Indicator Light Status (Varies by Model)**
- **Apple TV 4K (1st and 2nd gen) and Apple TV HD (4th gen):**
  - **On/Standby:** The light is usually **white**, but it is very dim and can be hard to notice.
  - **Off:** The light is **off**.
- **Older models (3rd gen or earlier):**
  - The light may **blink or stay lit** when powered on.

**Tip:** Observe the light in a darker environment or cup your hands around it to block ambient light.

### 2. **Other Ways to Check**
- **Remote Feedback:**
  - Press the **Home** or **Menu** button on the remote. If the Apple TV is on, the screen should respond (e.g., display the home screen or wake up).
- **HDMI Connection:**
  - Ensure the Apple TV is connected to the correct HDMI port on your TV and that the TV input is set to the correct HDMI port.
  - If the Apple TV is on, the TV screen will show the Apple TV interface or background.
- **Network Status:**
  - If connected to Wi-Fi, check your router’s device list to see if the Apple TV appears as an active device.

### 3. **Restart Attempt**
If you’re unsure, try **unplugging the power cord and plugging it back in**. Wait a few seconds to see if the light or screen changes.
