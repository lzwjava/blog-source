Got it — you’ve pasted what looks like an **FCC Broadband Facts label** for **Ultra Mobile’s PayGo Mobile Broadband plan**. These labels are like nutrition labels for internet/mobile plans: they summarize the costs, speeds, data limits, and terms in a standardized format so you can compare providers easily. Let me break it down for you:

---

### 📋 **Ultra Mobile PayGo – Key Points**

**1. Price**
- **Monthly Price**: **$3.00**  
   - Not an introductory rate (so it won’t increase by surprise later).  
   - No contract required (you can stop anytime).

**2. Fees**
- **Other Government Fees**: Up to **$2.45** (varies depending on location/regulations).  
- **Federal Universal Service Fund Fee**: **$0.04**  
- **Recovery Fee**: **$0.00**  
- **Federal Cost Recovery Fee**: **$0.00**  
- **One-time Fees**: None (so no activation/setup fee).  
- **Taxes**: Vary by location (state/local taxes aren’t included in the $3.00).

**3. Early Termination Fees**
- None. Since there’s no contract, you won’t be penalized for leaving.

**4. Data & Speeds**
- **Data Included**: **100 MB per month**  
   - This is a very small amount of data—basically enough for light use like messaging or occasional emails.  
   - Once you use 100 MB, there are **no extra charges**, but typically speeds may be slowed or the service stops unless you top-up (that detail isn’t specified here but is usually in the fine print).  
- **Speeds** (when you have data):
  - Download: **79–357 Mbps** (pretty fast, similar to 4G/5G speeds).  
  - Upload: **6–30 Mbps**  
  - Latency: **17–32 ms** (good responsiveness, useful for web browsing/streaming/light gaming).

**5. Network Management**
- Link provided: [Ultra Mobile Network Management Policy](https://www.ultramobile.com/network-management-policy/)  
  - Tells you how they manage congestion/throttling.

**6. Customer Support**
- **Phone**: (888) 777-0446  
- **FAQ Website**: [ultramobile.com/faq](https://www.ultramobile.com/faq/)

**7. Miscellaneous**

### ✅ So What Does This Mean for You?
- For **$3/month**, you get a very basic mobile broadband plan with **100 MB of data**.  
- Good for **emergencies or occasional very light use** (texts over data apps, check email, small maps usage).  
- Not suitable as a primary internet plan — 100 MB can be used up in minutes with video/music/apps.  
- Speeds are solid, but you’re capped by the tiny amount of included data.
