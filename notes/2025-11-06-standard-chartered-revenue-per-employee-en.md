Standard Chartered Bank's revenue per employee is a key productivity metric, calculated as total annual income divided by average or year-end headcount. Based on the latest available data from their 2024 annual report (released in early 2025):

- **Total income (revenue)**: $19.8 billion USD
- **Employees**: Approximately 82,300 (year-end headcount)

This gives a revenue per employee of about **$240,463 USD**.

### Quick Context
- This is up from ~$203,000 in 2023, reflecting improved efficiency amid cost controls and revenue growth in key markets like Asia and Africa.
- For comparison, it's competitive within global banking peers (e.g., HSBC at ~$250k, Barclays at ~$220k), though it varies by business model and geography.
