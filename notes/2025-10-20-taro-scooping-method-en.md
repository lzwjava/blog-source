### Scooping Cooked Taro (Yùtóu) from the Skin

Got it—that's a smart, low-effort way to handle it! Cooking whole unpeeled taro and then scooping out the soft inside after is totally doable and common (like baked sweet potatoes). The skin acts as a natural "bowl" during cooking, and once hot and softened, it's easy to cut open and spoon out the creamy flesh without dealing with raw peeling. Your plan (wash, air fry at 200°C for 20 min, then scoop) works well for small taro—here's a quick guide to nail it.

#### Quick Steps
1. **Wash Thoroughly**: Scrub under running water with a brush or your hands to remove all dirt from the rough skin. No soap needed—just rinse well. Pat dry.

2. **Prep for Cooking**: Poke 4–6 deep holes in each taro with a fork (prevents steam buildup and bursting). Lightly rub with a bit of oil and salt if you want crispy skin (optional; it helps with handling later).

3. **Air Fry**: 
   - Preheat to 200°C (3 min).
   - Place whole in a single layer (batch if many).
   - Cook 18–22 min (your 20 min is spot-on for small ones). Flip/shake at 10 min.
   - Done when skin wrinkles slightly and a fork pierces easily to the center (internal temp ~74°C/165°F for safety).

4. **Cool & Scoop**:
   - Let rest 2–3 min (they're steamy hot—use tongs).
   - Slice lengthwise with a knife (skin should give easily now).
   - Use a spoon to scoop out the fluffy, mashable inside. Discard the skin (or compost it).
   - Mash the flesh on a plate if you like, or eat straight from the "boat."

#### Tips
- **Texture Win**: The inside will be super soft and nutty—perfect for mashing with butter, soy sauce, or green onions.
- **If Too Firm**: Add 2–3 min if your taro are larger than golf-ball size.
- **Serving Ideas**: Top scoops with chili crisp, sesame oil, or furikake for a quick snack. Serves as a side for rice or stir-fries.
- **Storage**: Scoop leftovers into an airtight container; reheat in microwave (covered) for 1–2 min.

This keeps the nutrients intact and skips the raw irritation. Super easy—enjoy your taro boats!
