Yes, Avaloq does have a significant relationship with Oracle technology. Based on the search results, here are the key connections:

Avaloq Core Banking runs on Oracle Exadata, which is Oracle's high-performance database platform. Avaloq has been a Gold level member of Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN) and was named OPN Specialized Database Partner of the Year for EMEA in 2011, indicating a deep technical partnership.

Additionally, Avaloq selected Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Dedicated Region to bring a complete OCI cloud region into its own data center, showing their commitment to Oracle's cloud infrastructure.

The Avaloq platform appears to be available through Oracle's cloud marketplace as well, suggesting it's designed to integrate with Oracle's technology stack. However, while Avaloq has strong Oracle integration and runs on Oracle database technology (particularly Exadata), it's not exclusively "built upon Oracle" - it's a comprehensive banking software platform that leverages Oracle as one of its key underlying technologies, particularly for database and infrastructure needs.
