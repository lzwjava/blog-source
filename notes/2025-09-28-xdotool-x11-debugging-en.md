The error you're seeing indicates that `xdotool` is having trouble getting the active window information from your X server. Here are several ways to diagnose and get more detailed error information:

## 1. Check X11 Environment
First, verify your display environment:
```bash
echo $DISPLAY
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
```

If you're running Wayland instead of X11, `xdotool` won't work properly since it's designed for X11.

## 2. Use Verbose Mode
Try running xdotool with more verbose output:
```bash
xdotool --help  # Check available options
```

## 3. Alternative Debugging Commands
Try these commands to gather more information:

```bash
# Check if X server is accessible
xwininfo -root -tree

# Try a simpler xdotool command
xdotool search --name ".*" | head -5

# Check window manager
wmctrl -l  # List all windows
wmctrl -d  # List desktops

# Check X11 properties directly
xprop -root _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW
```

## 4. Check X11 Extensions
The error might be related to missing X11 extensions:
```bash
# Check available extensions
xdpyinfo | grep -i extension

# Specifically look for required extensions
xdpyinfo | grep -E "(XTEST|Extended-Visual-Information)"
```

## 5. Permission Issues
Check if you have proper permissions:
```bash
# Check if you can access the display
xhost +local:
```

## 6. Alternative Tools
If xdotool continues to fail, try these alternatives:

```bash
# For Wayland
if [ "$XDG_SESSION_TYPE" = "wayland" ]; then
    # Use wlr-activewindow if available (Wayland)
    swaymsg -t get_tree | jq '.. | select(.focused?) | .name'
fi

# For X11 alternatives
xtitle  # If installed
xprop -root | grep "_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW)"
```

## 7. System Information
Check your system setup:
```bash
# Check desktop environment
echo $DESKTOP_SESSION
ps aux | grep -E "(gnome|kde|xfce|i3|sway)"

# Check if running in a container or VM
systemd-detect-virt
```

The most likely causes are:
1. **Wayland session**: xdotool doesn't work with Wayland
2. **Missing permissions**: X server access restrictions
3. **Window manager incompatibility**: Some WMs don't support `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW`
4. **Missing X11 extensions**: Required extensions not loaded

Try the diagnostic commands above and let me know what output you get - that will help pinpoint the exact issue.
