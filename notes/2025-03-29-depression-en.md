I'm really sorry you're feeling depressed. It sounds like you've been juggling a lot of responsibilities and experiences lately, and that can be tough to manage all at once. Here's a bit of advice on how to navigate through it:

### 1. **Recognize Your Feelings**
It's important to acknowledge what you're going through. Depression can manifest in many ways—feeling overwhelmed, disconnected, or lacking motivation. It’s normal to have ups and downs, but recognizing and accepting how you're feeling is the first step toward healing.

### 2. **Reach Out for Support**
Talking to someone you trust can help lighten the emotional load. Whether it’s a friend, family member, or therapist, sharing your feelings can be therapeutic. It seems like you’ve had some ups and downs with your family, but sometimes it’s just about having an open conversation and asking for help when you need it.

### 3. **Focus on Small Wins**
You’ve accomplished so much already—whether it’s pursuing self-education, your open-source projects, or even family life. Sometimes, focusing on small, manageable tasks and acknowledging your achievements can help shift your mindset. What’s something small you can work on that will give you a sense of accomplishment?

### 4. **Take Care of Your Body**
Physical health is closely tied to mental well-being. Try incorporating physical activity into your routine—whether it’s a walk, stretching, or even trying something new like yoga or tai chi. These can help improve mood and reduce stress. 

### 5. **Mindfulness and Reflection**
You’ve already shown a lot of self-awareness in your reflections. Consider adding mindfulness or meditation practices to help you manage stress. Apps like Calm or Headspace can guide you through short sessions that might help center your thoughts.

### 6. **Limit Overstimulation**
Sometimes, especially with technology, we can feel mentally exhausted from the constant information overload. Consider taking breaks from social media or certain apps, and allow yourself to rest your mind. Since you've mentioned your interest in niche social media, maybe this can be a time to step back from comparing or overexposing yourself to external expectations.

The feelings you're experiencing are completely valid, and the process of overcoming depression is deeply personal and can vary from person to person. Here's why the suggestions I mentioned might be helpful:

### 1. **Recognize Your Feelings**
Understanding and acknowledging your emotions is key to healing. Often, depression can feel isolating because you might believe you're the only one feeling this way, or you might try to push your emotions down. Recognizing them allows you to move forward rather than staying stuck in a cycle of avoidance. Denying your emotions can sometimes make them stronger or more persistent.

### 2. **Reach Out for Support**
Humans are social creatures, and connection is vital for mental health. When you're feeling low, isolation can exacerbate negative feelings. Speaking with someone you trust provides an opportunity for validation, comfort, and the chance to see things from a new perspective. Others might even offer solutions or insights you hadn't considered. It also helps alleviate the burden of carrying everything on your own.

### 3. **Focus on Small Wins**
When you're feeling depressed, it's easy to feel like there's no progress or that everything is overwhelming. By focusing on small wins, you're creating positive reinforcement. Completing even a minor task can trigger a sense of achievement, boosting your confidence. It's about shifting the focus from the big picture to things that feel attainable in the moment, which can gradually build a sense of control and positivity.

### 4. **Take Care of Your Body**
The mind and body are closely connected. Physical activity has been shown to release endorphins, the body's natural mood lifters. When you're depressed, it's common to feel physically lethargic or disconnected, but regular exercise can help improve circulation, reduce stress, and boost overall mental clarity. It doesn't require intense workouts; even something like a daily walk can trigger a release of dopamine and serotonin, chemicals that are known to improve mood.

### 5. **Mindfulness and Reflection**
Mindfulness helps you focus on the present moment, reducing worry about the past or future. It’s common in depression to ruminate over past mistakes or fears about the future. By practicing mindfulness, you can break that cycle and bring your attention back to the here and now. Over time, mindfulness practice can help calm the mind, reduce anxiety, and improve your ability to cope with stress.

### 6. **Limit Overstimulation**
Our brains are constantly processing information, especially in today's digital age. Social media, work demands, and constant notifications can overwhelm your cognitive load. Taking breaks from this stimulation allows your brain to rest and reset. Reducing comparisons (e.g., seeing what others are doing on social media) can also help ease feelings of inadequacy or self-doubt that might contribute to depression.

The reason these steps might help is that depression is often a result of feeling overwhelmed, isolated, and powerless. By taking small, deliberate actions, you begin to restore a sense of control over your environment and emotions. Additionally, nurturing your body and mind through physical activity and support networks helps build resilience against future challenges. Your progress might be slow, but over time, these steps can lead to improved well-being.

It’s also important to acknowledge that overcoming depression can take time. It's not about quick fixes but about gradually making small, intentional changes that can make a difference over the long run. You don’t need to tackle everything at once. What do you feel would be most manageable to start with?
