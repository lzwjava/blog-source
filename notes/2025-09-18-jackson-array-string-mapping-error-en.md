title: Jackson Array to String Mapping Error
translated: false
---

### Issue Overview
If you're using Jackson (a popular Java library for JSON serialization/deserialization) and attempting to map a JSON array (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` or `["a", "b"]`) directly onto a Java field declared as `String`, it will fail during deserialization. Jackson doesn't provide a default conversion from JSON arrays to strings, as they are fundamentally different data types. This leads to a runtime error.

### Expected Error
Jackson typically throws a `JsonMappingException` with a message indicating the type mismatch. For example:
- If deserializing `[1, 2, 3]` to a `String field`, you'd see something like:  
  `Cannot deserialize instance of 'java.lang.String' out of START_ARRAY token`

The exact message may vary slightly by Jackson version (common in 2.x), but it's rooted in `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonMappingException`.

### Why This Happens
- Jackson uses type hints or field signatures to determine how to parse JSON. A JSON array starts with `[` (START_ARRAY), which Jackson expects to map to array/list types like `List<String>`, `int[]`, or arrays.
- A `String` field expects a JSON primitive (e.g., `"hello"`) or null, not an array.
- No built-in coercer in Jackson allows this mismatch for safety reasons, unlike some lighter type coersions for numbers/strings.

### How to Fix or Work Around
- **Change the Java field type**: Use a compatible array or collection, e.g., `List<String>`, `String[]`, or `Object` if you need flexibility.
- **Custom deserialization**: Annotate the field with `@JsonDeserialize(using = CustomDeserializer.class)` and define a deserializer to convert the array as needed (e.g., concatenate it).
- **If expecting a string representation**: Ensure the JSON sends a string (e.g., `"[1, 2, 3]"`) and deserialize accordingly.
- **Testing tip**: Use Jackson's `ObjectMapper` with try-catch to handle such errors gracefully and revert to defaults.
