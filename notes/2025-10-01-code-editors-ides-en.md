Popular general-purpose IDEs and code editors, similar to VS Code (extensible, lightweight, multi-language support) and Zed (fast, collaborative features), cater to a wide range of programming needs. Here's a curated list of some of the most popular ones based on recent discussions and rankings, focusing on those that are versatile, free (where applicable), and community-driven. They vary from lightweight editors to full IDEs with built-in debugging and project management.

### Top Picks
1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
   Microsoft's free, open-source editor with thousands of extensions. Excellent for web development, Python, JavaScript, and more. Known for its performance, Git integration, and customizability.  [1] [2]

2. **Zed**  
   A modern, fast code editor (available for macOS and Linux, with Windows support coming) built for collaboration and simplicity. Good for beginners and teams, with native Rust support and built-in AI features.  [3] [2]

3. **Sublime Text**  
   Lightweight, extensible editor popular for its speed and "Goto Anything" feature. Ideal for quick edits across languages, with a distraction-free mode. Commercial license but often used for free.  [1] [4]

4. **IntelliJ IDEA**  
   JetBrains' powerful IDE for Java and JVM languages, with strong support for Python, JavaScript, and more via plugins. Community edition is free; Ultimate edition adds enterprise features like database tools. [1]

5. **Vim**  
   Terminal-based editor with steep learning curve but immense power through plugins (e.g., via plugins like LunarVim). Highly customizable, no GUI needed, popular among advanced users for efficiency.  [5] [3]

6. **Emacs**  
   Highly extensible, lisp-based editor with modes for coding, writing, and more. Works well with plugins for IDE-like features; attracts users who script their workflow.  [1]

7. **Cursor**  
   AI-enhanced fork of VS Code, focused on code completion and chat-based editing. Free tier available, integrates OpenAI's models for smarter suggestions.  [2]

8. **Eclipse Theia**  
   Open-source IDE framework, fully VS Code compatible with extensions. Used for cloud-based editing and vendor-neutral setups; can run in browsers or desktops.  [6] [2]

9. **PyCharm**  
   JetBrains IDE optimized for Python, with Django/web support. Community edition is free; good for data science and web dev, extensible to other languages.  [1]

10. **VSCodium**  
    MIT-licensed fork of VS Code without telemetry. Essentially VS Code but more privacy-focused, with full extension compatibility.  [5]

These tools are often chosen for their ecosystems: VS Code and Zed emphasize speed and extensions, while full IDEs like IntelliJ provide deeper debugging. Popularity varies by use case—e.g., Vim for minimalists, IntelliJ for Java-heavy projects. Refer to comparisons on sites like Stack Overflow or JetBrains docs for specifics on platforms and features. [1][2][3] Try them based on your language preferences and workflow needs! If you're looking for recommendations in a specific category (e.g., AI-powered or free-only), let me know.
