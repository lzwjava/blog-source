### What is a Service Level Objective (SLO)?

A **Service Level Objective (SLO)** is a measurable target that defines the desired level of reliability, performance, or availability for a service or system. It's a key concept in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), where SLOs act as internal goals to ensure user satisfaction without over-engineering resources.

#### Key Components:
- **Service Level Indicator (SLI)**: The actual metric being measured (e.g., request latency, error rate, or uptime percentage).
- **Target Value**: A specific threshold or range (e.g., "99.9% of requests served in under 200ms").
- **Time Window**: The period over which the SLO is evaluated (e.g., rolling 28-day average).

#### SLO vs. SLA:
- **SLO**: Internal, aspirational targets for the engineering team (e.g., aim for 99.95% uptime).
- **SLA**: External, contractual commitments to customers, often derived from SLOs with penalties for breaches (e.g., 99.9% uptime with credits if violated).

#### In the Context of LLMs (e.g., from SLOs-Serve):
In large language model serving, SLOs are often stage-specific:
- **Time-to-First-Token (TTFT)**: Tight SLO for prefill (input processing) in interactive apps like chatbots.
- **Tokens-Per-Output-Time (TPOT)**: Decode SLO for generation speed, varying by workload (e.g., 50ms/token for coding vs. 100ms for summarization).

SLOs help balance throughput and latency in shared environments, preventing violations during bursts.
