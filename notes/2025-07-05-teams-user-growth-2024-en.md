As of early 2024 and continuing into June 2025, Microsoft Teams has a significant and growing user base. Here's an analysis of the reported figures:

**Key User Statistics (as of early 2024 / reported for 2024):**

* **Monthly Active Users (MAU): Over 320 million**
    * Several sources confirm this figure for early 2024. This marks a steady increase from 270 million in 2023.
* **Daily Active Users (DAU): Roughly 320 million (some sources indicate closer to 200 million or 300 million by mid-2024)**
    * While some reports state 320 million DAU, others suggest the daily active user count reached 200 million by mid-2024, reflecting a 15% increase from 175 million in 2023. It's important to note that Microsoft has sometimes shifted its reporting from DAU to MAU, which can lead to slight discrepancies in reported daily figures from different sources. However, the consistent reporting of 320 million monthly users suggests a very high daily engagement rate.

**Analysis of User Growth and Trends:**

1.  **Continued Growth Post-Pandemic:** While the COVID-19 pandemic fueled a massive surge in Teams adoption (e.g., from 20 million users in November 2019 to 75 million by April 2020), the platform has continued to grow steadily even after the initial remote work boom. This indicates that Teams has become an indispensable tool for many organizations, extending beyond crisis-driven adoption.

2.  **Enterprise Dominance:** Microsoft Teams holds a strong position in the enterprise market.
    * Over 1 million organizations actively utilize the platform.
    * Remarkably, **91% of Fortune 100 companies** have adopted Microsoft Teams.
    * Large enterprises show significant adoption, with **117 firms having more than 100,000 users** and **2,700 companies having more than 10,000 users**. This highlights its scalability and ability to handle complex organizational needs.

3.  **Integration with Microsoft 365:** A key driver of Teams' adoption is its seamless integration with other Microsoft 365 applications. In 2024, **85% of Teams users also actively use other Microsoft 365 services**, solidifying its role as a central hub for productivity.

4.  **Industry Adoption:** Teams is widely adopted across various industries, with **Information Technology (29.6%)** leading the way, followed by **Computer Software (11.8%)**, **Healthcare (9.6%)**, and **Education Management (8.3%)**.

5.  **Demographics:** The platform is most popular among professionals in their mid-career stages, with **61.21% of users aged 35 to 54**. Specifically, the 35-44 age group accounts for 31.23% of users, followed by 45-54 at 29.98%.

6.  **Engagement Metrics:**
    * In 2024, the average Microsoft Teams user spent approximately **90 minutes per day** on the platform.
    * Users sent an average of **22 billion messages per month** in 2024, up from 20 billion in 2023.
    * The platform records over **330 billion meeting minutes daily**, demonstrating massive global engagement.

**Outlook for June 2025:**

Given the consistent growth trends, strong enterprise adoption, and continuous feature development (including AI-powered tools like Copilot), it is highly probable that Microsoft Teams maintains or slightly increases its user base by June 2025. The reported figures for early 2024 (320 million monthly active users) are likely to be sustained or show marginal positive growth. Microsoft's ongoing investment in new features and integrations ensures its continued relevance in the evolving landscape of hybrid work and collaboration.

In summary, Microsoft Teams has firmly established itself as a dominant collaboration platform, with **over 320 million monthly active users as of early 2024**, a figure that is expected to remain robust or slightly increase by June 2025 due to strong enterprise adoption, seamless integration with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, and ongoing feature enhancements.
