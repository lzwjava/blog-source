Adam Smith is renowned for his contributions to economics, particularly through his seminal work, "The Wealth of Nations." Here are some of the main ideas associated with Adam Smith:

1. **Division of Labor**: Smith argued that dividing work into specialized tasks increases productivity and efficiency. This concept is fundamental to modern manufacturing and economic organization.

2. **The Invisible Hand**: This metaphor describes how individual self-interest can lead to collective good. Smith believed that when individuals pursue their own economic interests, they unintentionally contribute to the well-being of society as a whole.

3. **Free Market Economy**: Smith advocated for a free market system where prices and production are determined by competition and consumer choice, rather than government intervention.

4. **Laissez-Faire**: This philosophy suggests minimal government interference in economic affairs, allowing the market to regulate itself.

5. **Theory of Moral Sentiments**: In his earlier work, Smith explored the psychological and moral underpinnings of economic behavior, emphasizing empathy and mutual sympathy as foundational to human interactions.

These ideas have significantly influenced classical and modern economic thought, shaping policies and theories worldwide.
