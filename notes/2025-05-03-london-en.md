London, the capital of the United Kingdom, is a global city steeped in history, culture, and innovation. Spanning over 2,000 years, it has evolved from a small Roman settlement on the River Thames to one of the world’s most influential and vibrant metropolises. Covering approximately 1,572 square kilometers, it is home to a diverse population of around 9 million people (as of recent estimates), making it one of Europe’s largest cities. London’s blend of ancient landmarks, modern skyscrapers, cultural diversity, and economic power makes it a unique and dynamic destination.

### Historical Overview
London’s origins trace back to 43 CE when the Romans established *Londinium*, a trading port on the Thames. After the Roman withdrawal in the 5th century, the city grew through the Anglo-Saxon period and became a key center by the Middle Ages. The Norman Conquest of 1066 saw the construction of the Tower of London, still a prominent landmark. Over centuries, London weathered plagues, the Great Fire of 1666, and rapid expansion during the Industrial Revolution. The 19th and 20th centuries cemented its status as the heart of the British Empire, while World War II’s Blitz showcased its resilience. Today, London balances its rich history with cutting-edge modernity.
