### Understanding the Dishes
You're asking about 炒粉 (chow fun, typically stir-fried rice noodles) and 炒面 (chow mein, stir-fried wheat noodles), eaten in China with egg and meat. These are popular street foods or home dishes, often wok-tossed with ingredients like beef, pork, chicken, eggs, vegetables, and seasonings. Preparation varies by region (e.g., Cantonese chow fun is flatter noodles; northern styles might use hand-pulled noodles for 炒面).

### Are They Healthy?
Healthiness depends on preparation, portion sizes, frequency, and your overall diet. Here's a balanced breakdown:

- **Pros (Nutrient Benefits)**:
  - Good source of carbs for energy, plus protein from meat and eggs, which supports muscle repair.
  - Eggs provide vitamins like B12 and choline, and meat adds iron (e.g., red meat) or lean protein (e.g., chicken).
  - If stir-fried with minimal oil and lots of veggies (like bok choy or bean sprouts), they can be balanced, providing fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants.

- **Cons (Potential Drawbacks)**:
  - High in refined carbs from noodles, which can spike blood sugar if you're diabetic or eating large portions.
  - Often cooked with oil, salt, and soy sauce, making them calorie-dense (e.g., a serving might be 500-800 calories). Street versions may include MSG or preservatives.
  - Meat can be fatty (like pork belly), increasing saturated fat intake if not lean cuts.
  - In excess, they might contribute to weight gain, heart health issues, or digestive discomfort due to high sodium.

Evidence from nutrition sources: Diets like this in China are linked to longevity in moderation (e.g., Mediterranean-style eating), but processed noodles correlate with obesity in some studies. Generally, they're not ideal as a daily staple but fine occasionally. For health, opt for whole-grain noodles, lean meats, and less oil/salt.

### Do They Produce Too Much "Tanshui"?
I interpret "tanshui" as "痰水" (tán shuǐ in pinyin), meaning phlegm or excessive body fluids/mucus (a common concern in Chinese health talk). In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), certain foods are believed to cause "dampness" or phlegm buildup, leading to symptoms like congestion or sluggishness.

- **TCM Perspective**: Wet stir-frying with oil and noodles (seen as "damp" foods) might be thought to generate more phlegm, especially if you're "cooler" constitution or have allergies. Eggs and meat (especially fatty ones) are neutral or warming, but fried noodles could exacerbate this for some.
- **Modern Science View**: There's no strong evidence that these dishes directly produce excess phlegm. Mucus can increase from allergies, colds, or irritants, but food's role is debated. Fatty or salty foods might indirectly irritate the digestive system, but it's unlikely to "produce too much" by itself. If you're sensitive (e.g., gluten in wheat chow mein), it could worsen nasal congestion.

If you notice phlegm after eating, it might relate more to cooking method or individual physiology than the food itself.

### Tips for Healthier Eating
- **Moderation**: Limit to 1-2 times a week; pair with veggies.
- **Preparation**: Ask for less oil or use boiling instead of deep-frying.
- **Substitutes**: Try lean meats or tofu; add greens for balance.
- **Disclaimer**: I'm not a doctor. For personalized advice, especially if you have health conditions, consult a healthcare professional or use apps like MyFitnessPal to track nutrients. In China, these dishes are part of a balanced diet but vary by locale! If this isn't what you meant by "tanshui," clarify.
