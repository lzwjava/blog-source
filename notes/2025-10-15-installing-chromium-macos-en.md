Yes, macOS can absolutely install Chromium as an alternative to Google Chrome. Chromium is the open-source foundation that Chrome is built on, so it's very similar in functionality but lacks some proprietary Google features like automatic updates and certain codecs.

### How to Install It
There are a few straightforward methods:

1. **Via Homebrew (easiest for most users)**:
   - Install Homebrew if you haven't already: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`.
   - Then run: `brew install --cask chromium`.
   - This works on both Intel and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs.

2. **Direct Download**:
   - Go to the official Chromium site and download the latest build for Mac.
   - Unzip and drag the app to your Applications folder.

3. **For Developers or Custom Builds**:
   - Use tools like Woolyss for pre-built releases, or build from source if needed (requires Xcode).

Once installed, you can set Chromium as your default browser in System Settings > Desktop & Dock > Default web browser.
