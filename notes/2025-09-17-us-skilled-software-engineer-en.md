Thanks for sharing such a detailed background — it’s impressive how much you’ve accomplished and documented. Given your experience, here are the **realistic pathways for you to move to, work in, or study in the U.S.**  

---

## 1. Employment-Based Pathways
With **11 years of professional software engineering experience** and a strong open-source portfolio, you could qualify for several U.S. work visa categories:

### **H-1B Visa (Specialty Occupations)**
- The most common pathway for skilled software engineers.
- Requirements: a bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience. Since you don’t have a complete bachelor’s, this could be tricky.
  - *BUT*: The U.S. sometimes accepts equivalent experience — usually **3 years of professional experience = 1 year of university study**. With 11 years, this may count as "degree equivalence."
- You’d need a U.S. employer to sponsor you and enter the H-1B lottery (highly competitive).

### **O-1 Visa (Individuals with Extraordinary Ability)**
- For people with **extraordinary ability and achievements** in sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics.
- Your **GitHub open-source projects, blog, and corporate record** could strengthen an O-1 application — especially if you can get media mentions, proof of wide usage of your software, or industry recognition.
- This might be more suitable than H-1B since you don’t have a standard bachelor’s degree.

### **L-1 Visa (Intra-Company Transfer)**
- If you work at a multinational company (like HSBC), you may be able to transfer to their U.S. offices after holding a position in China for at least 1 year.
- This could be smoother than applying as an outside candidate.

## 2. Study Pathways
If you prefer education as a bridge:
- **F-1 Student Visa**: You could apply for a U.S. degree program (bachelor’s top-up, master’s in computer science, or a professional program). Your IELTS 6 may meet admission requirements for some schools, especially community colleges or state universities.
- From F-1, you could transition to **OPT (Optional Practical Training)** and then to H-1B or O-1.

Given your **self-taught and nontraditional path**, universities might find your portfolio extremely compelling. You could even target schools open to "unconventional prodigy" applicants.

## 3. Permanent Residency (Green Card) Options
- **EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver)**: If you can argue that your AI/engineering contributions serve the U.S. national interest, you may skip employer sponsorship. Your open-source work + AI knowledge + publications could make you a candidate.
- **EB-1A (Extraordinary Ability Green Card)**: Harder than EB-2, but possibly attainable with stronger evidence of international recognition — citations, awards, press.

## 4. Practical Steps You Can Take Now
1. **Strengthen Achievements for O-1 or EB-2 NIW**
   - Publish more open-source projects with traction (stars, forks, users).
   - Write and publish articles on reputable platforms (Medium, tech journals, or co-author papers).
   - Speak at conferences (tech meetups in China or virtually).
   - Collect recommendation letters from respected professionals.

2. **Consider L-1 via HSBC**
   - Explore internal opportunities to transfer to a U.S. office.

3. **Boost English Proficiency**
   - IELTS 6 is good, but U.S. universities often prefer IELTS 6.5–7+. Consider retaking for a higher score.

4. **Build Legal Support**
   - Consult an experienced U.S. immigration lawyer specializing in O-1/EB-2 NIW for software developers.

## 5. Which Path Fits You Best?
- If you want the **fastest work option**: pursue **L-1 transfer** with your multinational employer.  
- If you want the **prestige path**: strengthen your profile for **O-1** or **EB-2 NIW** (longer, but direct to green card).  
- If you want a **student-to-work bridge**: apply for a specialized U.S. degree (CS, AI, or entrepreneurship) and then shift to OPT/H-1B.  

---

👉 Since you have already been to the U.S. two times (which shows good visa history) and your track record is strong, I’d say you realistically have **three viable routes: L-1 via HSBC, O-1 with portfolio strengthening, or F-1 to OPT→H-1B.**
