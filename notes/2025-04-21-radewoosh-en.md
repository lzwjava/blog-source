Mateusz Radecki (a.k.a. **Radewoosh**) is another absolute legend in competitive programming, and while his style and trajectory are different from Gennady’s, he’s also **elite**—and for good reason. Here's why Radewoosh is so good:

---

### 🧠 1. **Sharp Problem-Solving Mind**
- Mateusz has extremely strong **algorithmic thinking** and can dissect problems quickly to find the underlying patterns or transformations needed.
- His solutions are often **clever and clean**, showing deep insight into both problem constraints and implementation details.

---

### ⏳ 2. **Long-Term Consistent Practice**
- Like most top coders, he didn’t become great overnight. He’s been active in the competitive programming scene for **over a decade**.
- He’s done thousands of problems across different platforms (Codeforces, AtCoder, etc.), constantly sharpening his skills.

---

### 💡 3. **Creative and Risk-Taking**
- Radewoosh is known for **innovative approaches**. He’s not afraid to try out-of-the-box ideas even under contest pressure.
- Sometimes his strategies are unusual but extremely effective, and that kind of creativity gives him an edge.

---

### ⚡ 4. **Incredible Speed and Efficiency**
- He often solves problems faster than almost anyone else in contests.
- On Codeforces, for example, it’s common to see him finish a 5-problem round with time to spare, ranking in the top 10 regularly.

---

### 🔧 5. **Tool-Making and Efficiency Hacks**
- Radewoosh uses **custom templates and tools** to minimize overhead during contests.
- He even wrote **his own testing frameworks** to speed up debugging and checking edge cases. That’s how optimized his workflow is.

---

### 🧰 6. **Strong Mathematical Background**
- A lot of hard problems rely on number theory, combinatorics, or geometry. Radewoosh handles these with ease.
- His mathematical intuition is solid, helping him simplify complex problems into solvable chunks.

---

### 💬 7. **Community Involvement**
- He contributes problems, helps in Codeforces rounds, and is respected as both a **competitor** and a **problem setter**.
- Being involved on both sides gives him a broader understanding of how problems are built and what tricks are used.

---

### 🤘 8. **Cool-Headed and Persistent**
- He doesn’t tilt easily, even after getting stuck or misreading a problem.
- His resilience and focus allow him to bounce back quickly in long contests or when things go wrong.

So while Gennady is more of a "silent assassin" type—flawless and calm—Radewoosh brings this kind of **fiery creativity and boldness** that’s super fun to watch. Both are top-tier, just with different vibes.
