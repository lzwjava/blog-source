    * **Features:**
        * Customizable tracking for various parameters.
        * Data visualization (charts, graphs) to identify trends and correlations.
        * Ability to log specific exercises and routines.
        * Potentially integrate with reminders and notifications to maintain consistency.
        * A section to document your findings, insights, and adjustments to your methodology.
    * **Why it fits:** Directly aligns with your self-taught research and allows you to further your experimentation in a structured way. You can leverage your full-stack and mobile skills for this.

**2. Enhancing Your Learning & Knowledge Management:**

* **Advanced Personal Knowledge Base & Learning Hub:**
    * **Concept:** Create a system to organize and connect the vast amount of information you've accumulated from books, articles, and your research.
