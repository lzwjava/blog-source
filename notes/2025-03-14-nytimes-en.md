## Trade War Heats Up, China Officials Stir Nationalist Sentiment but Leave Room for Maneuver

Chinese state media has been circulating an old video of Mao Zedong's famous battle cry, reflecting the escalating trade war with the U.S. The latest round includes U.S. threats of 100% tariffs, port fees, Chinese sanctions on U.S. shipping subsidiaries, and a possible U.S. ban on Chinese cooking oil imports. China's propaganda machine has rallied citizens with messages of resilience and patriotism while avoiding overly aggressive language, indicating a willingness to reconcile with the U.S. The trade tensions come amid China's economic struggles, including deflation, a weak property market, and high youth unemployment. However, China's advancements in AI, new export markets, and a surging stock market provide support for more aggressive government actions. Chinese officials have framed Beijing’s new rules on rare earths as a bold move, describing them as a licensing system rather than an export ban. Despite the hawkish tone, China's real priorities are negotiating with Washington on tariffs, export controls, and U.S. support for Taiwan. Experts suggest that while the propaganda aims to rally domestic support, it also risks narrowing the room for compromise.

## U.S.-China Tech Supply Chain Control Battle, Corporate Pressure

The U.S. and China are intensifying their contest for control over tech supply chains, with the Dutch government taking control of the Chinese-owned chip maker Nexperia under pressure from U.S. officials. Nexperia, owned by Wingtech, operates a global supply chain for older types of chips used in cars and electronics. The U.S. had previously placed trade restrictions on Wingtech and expanded its blacklist to include Nexperia, citing concerns over Chinese ownership and control.

The Dutch government's move was aimed at preventing potential supply disruptions, but documents revealed that U.S. officials had been pressuring the Dutch government about Nexperia's ownership for months. The U.S. Department of Commerce had placed trade restrictions on Wingtech in December 2024 and warned that Nexperia could face similar restrictions unless it replaced its Chinese CEO.

Nexperia is one of many companies caught in the broader battle for control of the global chip industry. Both the U.S. and China are asserting authority over semiconductor and mineral supply chains, which are critical for various technologies. This has led to concerns that China could dominate the market for older types of chips, which are used in a wide array of products.

In response to the Dutch government's takeover, China's Ministry of Commerce imposed restrictions on Nexperia's Chinese units, limiting their ability to export certain products. China has also announced sweeping controls on critical minerals used in chips and other technologies, mirroring similar U.S. controls. Additionally, China imposed sanctions on American subsidiaries of the South Korean shipping company Hanwha, accusing them of supporting U.S. shipbuilding efforts.

Experts predict that as the U.S. and China continue to exert influence over supply chains, other countries will seek to unwind Chinese ownership of key technology assets on national security grounds. This escalating contest for influence is expected to continue, with governments looking for ways to regain control of critical technology manufacturing.

## China's Strongest Card Against Trump: A Masterstroke or a Mistake?

China tightened export controls on rare earth metals to both strengthen its global supply dominance and to pressure President Trump into addressing perceived sabotage of U.S.-China détente by his subordinates. This move successfully redirected Trump's focus toward trade with China but also unsettled European governments and businesses, leading to a new round of trade retaliations and stock market volatility.

Trump responded by threatening to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and cutting off U.S. purchases of Chinese cooking oil. China retaliated by adding American subsidiaries of a South Korean shipping company to its sanctions list. The U.S. Treasury Secretary suggested exerting more control over private American businesses in key strategic sectors to counter Chinese economic measures.

The escalating tensions threaten to undo the progress made in the past five months toward rolling back punitive measures between the two countries. The question remains whether Beijing's strategy of using rare earths as a geopolitical weapon was too aggressive, potentially leading to a full-blown trade war and global economic slowdown.

China's move was a response to the U.S. Commerce Department's decision to expand its blacklist of companies, including potentially Chinese ones, from acquiring American technology. This decision surprised Beijing, which believed a truce had been reached after four rounds of negotiations and a phone call between Xi Jinping and Trump.

Analysts suggest that China's strategy was also aimed at demonstrating strength to a domestic audience before a crucial Communist Party meeting. Chinese state media hailed rare earths as the ultimate weapon in trade negotiations with the U.S., with one commentator calling the restrictions a "fatal blow."

The U.S. and China continued to escalate tensions, with both sides imposing higher port entry fees on each other's shipping firms. Trump threatened to restrict more trade with China, including boycotting Chinese cooking oil. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce sought to reassure the world that the new controls would not be widely used and did not represent a blanket ban, while vowing to fight back against any tariffs.

China's economy, already struggling with a prolonged property crisis and deflationary spiral, cannot afford more trade tensions. Experts suggest that China could have pushed back without threatening economic coercion against its geopolitical rivals. The new rare earth export controls, modeled after U.S. controls, were likely developed well in advance and may have been used as a pretext to deploy new measures.

## China's Rare Earth Control: "An Eye for an Eye"

Over the past three years, the U.S. has imposed global rules to restrict the export of advanced computer chips and related tools to China, aiming to prevent China from gaining an edge in artificial intelligence. In response, China announced a set of restrictions on the export of critical minerals, which are essential for various products including computer chips, cars, and missiles. These new rules, set to take effect later this year, require foreign governments and businesses to obtain licenses from Beijing for trading these products, even outside China.

China's dominance in the production of rare earth minerals and its control over strategic industries give it a significant ability to weaponize supply chains, potentially more so than the U.S. This move has reignited tensions between the two largest economies, with Trump threatening to increase tariffs on Chinese imports by 100% if Beijing does not back down.

The U.S. had previously used similar tactics, such as the foreign direct product rule, to target Chinese tech giant Huawei. This approach has been a basis for a series of global tech rules during the Biden administration. However, China's new restrictions are seen as broader and more impactful, affecting a wider range of industries and products.

The U.S. government and analysts view China's licensing system as a global power grab and are prepared to impose tariffs if China proceeds. Chinese officials have criticized the U.S. for extraterritorial enforcement of economic measures and insist on consistency in their actions. The U.S. and China are now in a delicate stage of mutual interdependence, with each leveraging supply chains that the other has struggled to boost domestically.

China's actions are seen as a response to U.S. efforts to restart its own rare earth industry and to demonstrate leverage before a potential meeting between Trump and Xi. The implications of China's new licensing system could be extraordinarily broad, affecting almost all semiconductors made globally. Companies and governments worldwide are concerned about the extensive corporate information China is requesting in the licensing process, which could accelerate efforts to build non-Chinese supply chains for rare earths.

## U.S. Government Seeks to Control More Companies to Counter China

The Trump administration aims to counter China's economic measures by increasing control over American companies in key strategic sectors. This marks a shift from traditional free-market policies to a more interventionist approach, similar to China's economic strategies. The U.S. seeks to reduce its reliance on China for sensitive technologies, particularly rare-earth minerals and battery technology, which China uses as leverage in trade negotiations. The administration has already taken stakes in several companies, including U.S. Steel, Intel, Trilogy Metals, and MP Materials, and has demanded revenue cuts from Nvidia and AMD's chip sales in China. The U.S. is also developing a "strategic mineral reserve" and plans to use price floors and forward buying to prevent China from dominating other sectors. Tensions escalated after China proposed a new licensing system for products containing rare-earth minerals, which would require global trade approval from Beijing. The U.S. responded with threats of additional tariffs and potential cancellation of a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Despite the escalating tensions, there are ongoing efforts for diplomatic engagement, including potential meetings between Trump and Xi.

## U.S.-China Trade War: Global Conflagration

The article discusses the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, which are having global repercussions. Key points include:

- The U.S. has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, with other countries following suit.
- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) released a report that does not fully capture the economic turmoil caused by these trade disputes.
- New U.S. tariffs on imported wood, furniture, and kitchen cabinets, along with higher port entry fees between the U.S. and China, have taken effect.
- China has tightened restrictions on the export of rare earth metals, essential for modern technology, and new restrictions on equipment for electric car batteries are forthcoming.
- The volatile U.S.-China relationship is causing uncertainty and forcing other countries to take sides.
- The European Union has imposed punishing tariffs on steel, affecting countries like Britain, which exports a significant portion of its steel to the EU.
- The protectionist measures are spreading, with countries like Canada, Brazil, and Mexico taking steps to protect their steel industries.
- Despite the trade tensions, the global economy remains highly integrated, with growth slowing in both the U.S. and China.
- The dynamic between the two largest economies is characterized by China's stable objectives versus the U.S.'s fluctuating policies, leading to significant uncertainty.

## Global Women's Summit Held in China, But Women's Rights Activities Suppressed

China's leader, Xi Jinping, pledged unwavering support for women’s rights at the 2025 Global Leaders’ Meeting on Women in Beijing, marking the 30th anniversary of the 1995 United Nations conference on women’s rights. Xi highlighted China's achievements in supporting women in sports, technology, and entrepreneurship, quoting Mao Zedong's phrase that women hold up "half the sky." However, activists argue that the fight for women’s rights in China has become more challenging in recent years due to a crackdown on civil society and independent feminist groups. The government has arrested activists, shut down feminist social media accounts, and warned against "extreme feminism," labeling it a foreign ideology aimed at weakening China. Xi has also encouraged women to embrace marriage and childbearing to address the country's falling birth rate. The government has released books and reports promoting a controlled version of women’s advancement, urging Chinese women’s groups not to adopt Western ideas of equality. Despite these efforts, Chinese women have made significant strides in education and societal attitudes, with divorce becoming more accepted and legal victories in anti-domestic violence laws. However, enforcement of these laws remains inconsistent. The government's official stance on feminism is clear: it disapproves of certain forms of feminism, viewing them as disruptive to the country.

## Mysterious CEO and Billions in Sales: Are Banned Nvidia Chips Flowing into China?

The article discusses the investigation into Megaspeed, a Singapore-based data center company, and its significant purchases of Nvidia's AI chips. Megaspeed, led by Huang Le (Alice Huang), has been under scrutiny by U.S. officials for potentially helping Chinese companies bypass American export restrictions. The company's close ties to Chinese tech firms and its rapid acquisition of advanced Nvidia technology have raised concerns about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls and the potential for American technology to be used by adversaries like China.

Nvidia, the dominant provider of AI chips, has seen its revenue soar, making it the world's most valuable publicly traded company. However, this success has coincided with U.S. government concerns that its chips could aid China in developing new weapons, surveilling dissidents, and advancing in AI development. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have imposed restrictions on AI chip sales to China, but some Chinese companies have found ways to circumvent these limits, including setting up data centers in Southeast Asia.

Megaspeed's operations, including its purchases from Inspur, a Chinese tech firm sanctioned by the U.S., have been particularly concerning. Inspur's U.S. subsidiary, Aivres, has been able to buy Nvidia chips freely due to its American registration, despite Inspur's sanctions. U.S. officials suspect that some of these chips may have been diverted to China, although they lack conclusive evidence.

The investigation has involved visits to Megaspeed's facilities and scrutiny from Singaporean and Malaysian authorities. Megaspeed's operations have been described as opaque, with minimal staff and unclear ownership structures. The company has denied any wrongdoing, and Nvidia has stated that it has found no evidence of diversion. However, the case highlights the challenges faced by U.S. officials in preventing the misuse of advanced technology and the complex networks used by some companies to evade export controls.

## U.S.-China Port Fee Dispute, Trade Tensions Escalate

The U.S. has started imposing fees on Chinese ships docking at American ports, aiming to counter China's dominance in commercial shipbuilding and revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry. China has threatened retaliation by imposing similar fees on American ships docking in China. The move comes amid escalating trade tensions, including recent U.S. threats to impose more tariffs on China following China's stricter restrictions on rare earth minerals.

Supporters of the U.S. measures argue that China's subsidies have given it an unfair advantage in shipbuilding, and the fees are intended to deter the purchase of Chinese ships. Critics, however, warn that the fees will make supply chains less efficient and increase the cost of imported goods. The fees are part of a broader trade investigation started under the Biden administration and will affect both Chinese-owned ships and non-Chinese ships built in China.

The new rules are expected to significantly impact major Chinese shipping companies like COSCO, which could face substantial financial burdens. The U.S. penalties are part of a broader effort to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry, which has been in decline for decades. However, skeptics doubt that these measures will significantly boost U.S. shipbuilding or curb China's industry, which has been expanding its lead over competitors like Japan and South Korea.

The U.S. actions also target foreign-built ships carrying liquefied natural gas, a key U.S. export, but have softened some restrictions following pressure from the oil and gas industry. The U.S. Trade Representative has removed a provision that would have suspended export licenses for LNG if not carried on American-made ships. The overall impact of these measures on global trade and the U.S. shipbuilding industry remains to be seen.

## Brazil's Soybeans Seize Opportunity as US-China Trade War Threatens Forests

The article discusses the geopolitical implications of the U.S.-China trade war, particularly focusing on the soybean industry and its impact on Brazil's environment. China's significant demand for soybeans, primarily for cooking oil and livestock feed, has led to extensive deforestation in Brazil, the largest supplier. The trade war has pushed China to stop buying American soybeans, incentivizing Brazilian farmers to expand soybean cultivation, which threatens the Cerrado, the world's largest tropical savanna.

Brazil's powerful farm lobby is pushing to dismantle the Soy Moratorium, a key measure designed to limit deforestation in the Amazon. This move is awkward for Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is hosting international climate negotiations in November. The Soy Moratorium has been effective in slowing deforestation in the Amazon but is under pressure due to economic incentives.

The article highlights the environmental impact, noting that soybean plantations often replace previously logged and cleared lands, leading to significant deforestation in the Cerrado. The Soy Moratorium, which restricts the purchase of soybeans grown on lands deforested after 2008, is under threat. The Brazilian government's enforcement has slowed deforestation, but the pressure to expand soybean production for export to China is increasing.

The article also discusses the economic implications for American soybean farmers, who risk losing their main customer, China, due to the trade dispute. The tariffs have increased the costs of fertilizer and equipment in the U.S., further complicating the situation. The future of the Soy Moratorium and the environmental impact of expanded soybean cultivation remain uncertain.

## It's Time for the West to Learn to Bear "Less" and "Worse"

The article discusses the profound threat to the Western belief in progress, which has been a defining feature since the Enlightenment. This belief, that the future will always be better than the present, is now challenged by pervasive loss in various aspects of life, including environmental degradation, economic decline, demographic shifts, weakened public infrastructures, and geopolitical regressions. The article highlights that the modern ethos, which assumes dynamism and improvement, struggles to accommodate feelings of loss. This denial of loss is seen as a foundational lie of Western modernity.

The article suggests that the rise of right-wing populism is a response to this sense of loss and decline. Populist politics promise restoration but offer only illusions of recovery. The crucial question becomes how to deal with loss. The article proposes several strategies: a politics of resilience to strengthen societies against negative events, revaluing loss as potential gain by redefining progress, and redistributing gains and losses more equitably. However, it acknowledges that these strategies cannot abolish loss entirely.

The final strategy proposed is acknowledgment and integration, where loss is neither denied nor absolutized but woven into individual and collective narratives. This approach is seen as essential for the renewal of liberal democracy, which must learn to articulate a more ambivalent narrative that acknowledges loss, confronts vulnerability, redefines progress, and pursues resilience. The article concludes that learning to live with loss could mark a step toward maturity and a deeper form of progress.

## Youth's Cry: The Voice of Protest Ignites "Asian Spring"

A new wave of resistance is sweeping across South and Southeast Asia, driven by young people who are using social media to organize and express their grievances. This movement, reminiscent of the Arab Spring, is fueled by widespread youth unemployment, economic crises, and a growing wealth disparity. Traditional progressive movements have fragmented or been decimated, leaving a void that young protesters are filling with their own decentralized, digital activism.

In countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Nepal, protests have erupted due to economic hardships and political corruption. These protests have often turned violent in response to state brutality, leading to significant political changes, including the resignation of leaders and power vacuums. Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok have become crucial tools for organizing and amplifying these movements.

The article highlights that while the Arab Spring ultimately led to chaos and violence, the current Asian uprisings have a different dynamic. Young people are using digital organizing as a core political strategy, learning from past failures to build more effective, decentralized movements. The article warns that without credible leftist or progressive alternatives, the region could face continued unrest, including military coups and sectarian violence. However, it also notes that this generation is finding its voice and that those in power ignore it at their peril.

## Is China's Farewell to Green "Involution" a Blessing or a Curse?

China's rapid rise as a leader in green technology has significant implications for global climate efforts and geopolitics. China's green industrial revolution has been a major driver of renewable energy growth, with 93% of global power additions in 2024 coming from renewable sources, and 74% of wind and solar projects worldwide being built by China. This dominance has made the United States and Europe appear as secondary players in the global energy transition.

However, China's aggressive price competition, known as "involution," has led to overcapacity and financial struggles for domestic companies. President Xi Jinping has declared an end to this practice, aiming for a new industrial strategy focused on principles other than price competition. This shift could have unclear implications for both climate efforts and geopolitical dynamics.

Meanwhile, the U.S. is experiencing a mood shift from competition to envy and awe regarding China's progress. This is reflected in various publications and discussions, indicating a tacit admission of geopolitical weakness. The U.S. has also faced setbacks in the high-end chip industry, with China now confident in its domestic chip manufacturing capabilities.

The geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China is evolving, with the future of the planet hanging in the balance. The U.S. is pivoting from a Cold War-style confrontation to a focus on regional dynamics and domestic security, while China's dominance in green technology and manufacturing continues to grow.

## "Between Retaliation and Reconciliation: Trump's Contradictory Attitude Towards China"

President Trump's approach to China has been marked by a contradictory mix of aggressive and conciliatory stances. Initially, he threatened severe tariffs and other measures in response to China's new controls on rare earth minerals, labeling them as "sinister and hostile." However, within 48 hours, he shifted to a more conciliatory tone, reassuring that the U.S. wants to help China and that everything will be fine. This internal tug-of-war between retaliation and reconciliation has caused market volatility and business uncertainty.

Trump's administration has taken steps to decouple the U.S. from China, including threatening high tariffs and suspending technology sales, but they also seek a trade agreement and a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The administration's conflicting messages have left markets and businesses scrambling, with no clear long-term strategy evident.

China's new restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for various high-tech products, have added to the tension. These minerals are a significant sticking point in U.S.-China negotiations. China's actions are seen as a response to the U.S. expanding its global technology restrictions, which China views as undermining progress between the two nations.

The administration's mixed signals are aimed at different audiences: the initial threats to show resolve and punish China, and the softer tone to calm markets and reassure allies. The administration hopes to keep the possibility of a summit and a broader trade agreement on the table, especially as American farmers feel the impact of the trade war.

Despite the conflicting messages, the administration is working to stabilize the finances of farmers and maintain leverage in negotiations. However, the future of this leverage is uncertain, especially with the Supreme Court set to hear arguments over the administration's use of emergency authorities to impose tariffs.

## U.S. Severely Dependent on Chinese Pharmaceutical Raw Materials

America heavily relies on China for raw materials in medicines, with nearly 700 U.S. medicines using at least one chemical solely sourced from China. This dependence raises concerns about potential vulnerabilities, especially during trade disputes or pandemics. Key examples include antibiotics like amoxicillin and generic drugs for heart problems, seizures, cancer, and HIV. The production of these chemicals in the U.S. is limited due to environmental and cost constraints, making Chinese factories more cost-effective. President Trump's proposed tariffs on Chinese products could impact drugmakers relying on Chinese raw materials. Despite recent investments by major drugmakers in U.S. factories, these plants focus on later stages of drug production, not raw materials. Experts note that there is no financial incentive for raw material production to return to the U.S. The supply chain for medicines is complex, with different countries handling various stages of production. Even drugs with broad geographic production can depend on Chinese raw materials. U.S. Pharmacopeia's analysis highlights the need for better data and targeted interventions to ensure patient safety and supply chain resilience.

## Trump's New Tariff Threat Against China Causes Global Stock Market Turmoil

Trump's threat to impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese goods starting November 1 and to restrict exports of "all key software" caused global market fluctuations. Asian markets fell initially, while U.S. and European markets rebounded as U.S. officials attempted to ease tensions. The S&P 500 index rose 1.6%, its largest single-day gain since May, while the Nasdaq index, heavily influenced by tech companies like Nvidia, gained 2.2%. European markets also saw slight gains. Trump's threats were in response to China's announcement to restrict exports of rare-earth minerals crucial for high-tech products. Despite the volatility, some analysts believe the threats are more about gaining negotiating leverage ahead of upcoming bilateral talks. China's exports to the EU, Southeast Asia, and Africa have offset the decline in exports to the U.S. The Dutch government's takeover of a Chinese-owned chipmaker, Nexperia, due to governance issues, has strained relations between China and Europe. The U.S. government shutdown is also impacting the real economy, and investors are awaiting quarterly earnings reports from major companies to gauge the U.S. economic health. JPMorgan Chase announced plans to facilitate $1.5 trillion in financing and investments over the next decade, focusing on industries critical to U.S. economic security.

## China's Efforts to Attract Foreign Young Tech Talent Unpopular with Public

The Chinese government introduced a new visa to attract young science and technology talent, aiming to become a leading scientific power. However, this move has sparked significant public backlash. Many Chinese citizens are concerned that the visa will lead to foreigners taking jobs from locals, especially at a time when young people are struggling to find employment. Prominent influencers and social media users have exacerbated these sentiments, often expressing nationalism or xenophobia. The backlash has been so intense that the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, had to publish an editorial defending the visa and criticizing the public's reaction.

The public outcry suggests that China may face challenges in attracting top global scientists, even as the United States reduces research funding. Anti-foreign sentiment has been growing in China, fueled by government warnings about foreign threats and calls to report potential spies. Historically, China has had very low levels of inbound immigration, and there are still significant cultural and legal barriers for foreigners seeking long-term residency. Previous attempts to loosen residency requirements were met with similar backlash.

The new visa's details, including whether it grants work rights, remain unclear. Officials have only stated that applicants need a bachelor's degree in science, technology, engineering, or math from a top university. The difficult job market for young people in China, exacerbated by slowing economic growth, has made this issue particularly contentious. Despite China producing the most science and technology graduates globally, these graduates make up a smaller proportion of the workforce compared to many Western countries. Experts suggest that greater transparency about the visa process could help alleviate public concerns, but the government's intent to attract more foreign expertise is clear.

## How the Las Vegas Casino Mogul Helped the NBA Return to China

In 2021, Patrick Dumont, a casino mogul, proposed to the NBA commissioner that American professional basketball should return to China. The NBA's relationship with China had been strained since 2019, when a team executive's tweet supporting Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests led to significant financial losses and sponsorship withdrawals. Dumont, whose company Las Vegas Sands operates lucrative casinos in Macau, saw an opportunity to help the NBA re-enter China through Macau, a semi-autonomous city.

Dumont's family had billions at stake, as Las Vegas Sands was focusing on Asia after selling its Nevada properties. The COVID-19 pandemic had devastated profits, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping was tightening control over Macau, insisting on diversification beyond gambling. Sands needed to invest heavily in non-gambling entertainment to secure its license.

Dumont and his family, including his mother-in-law Miriam Adelson, engaged in extensive diplomacy, meeting with Chinese and Macau officials and hosting events celebrating "one country, two systems." They also bought a majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks, though Dumont denied any connection to his efforts to bring the NBA to Macau.

The efforts culminated in two preseason games between the Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns at the Venetian Arena in Macau, part of a five-year agreement for the NBA to return to China. The deal was seen as a win for both the NBA, which had lost over $300 million, and Chinese leaders seeking to enhance China's global image through sports and celebrities.

The NBA had maintained its presence in China, keeping offices open and hiring experts for Chinese social media. The league also donated to China during the pandemic and installed the son of a former CCTV executive to lead NBA China. Despite these efforts, the NBA was cautious about another controversy, emphasizing the importance of speaking through the game rather than engaging in political statements.

The 2019 preseason trip to Shanghai and Shenzhen was initially expected to be a profitable venture, but it was overshadowed by pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. A tweet by Daryl Morey, then the general manager of the Houston Rockets, supporting Hong Kong's protests led to widespread backlash, with Chinese officials and state broadcaster CCTV ceasing to air NBA games. The NBA's attempts to appease both sides by releasing different statements in English and Chinese further complicated the situation.

Macau, known for its gambling industry, faced increasing pressure from Beijing to diversify and rebrand as a family-friendly destination. Sands needed to invest in non-gambling entertainment to secure its license, and hosting NBA games was seen as a way to achieve this. The Venetian Arena, which had primarily hosted concerts, was modernized for the NBA games.

The deal was finalized in December 2024, with the NBA announcing preseason games in Macau. NBA commissioner Adam Silver emphasized the need for flexibility in the renewed relationship with China, acknowledging that ideological purity on either side would hinder progress. The NBA's return to China was seen as a significant step in rebuilding the relationship, with both sides recognizing the benefits of continued dialogue and cooperation.

## U.S. and Arab World Join Hands to Promote Gaza Agreement

The article details the diplomatic efforts leading to a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Key points include:

- **Negotiations and Pressures**: The negotiations were held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, with significant involvement from the U.S., Qatar, and other Arab countries. The U.S. applied pressure on Israel to compromise, while Qatar and other mediators played crucial roles in facilitating the talks.

- **Key Players**: Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, were instrumental in the negotiations. The Qatari prime minister also played a significant role by urging the U.S. to push Israel for concessions.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs**: The talks faced significant obstacles, including maximalist positions from both Israel and Hamas. Israel wanted to maintain control over certain areas in Gaza, while Hamas demanded a complete withdrawal. The breakthrough came when both sides agreed to a compromise, with Israel retaining more territory than Hamas wanted but pulling out of many built-up areas.

- **Final Agreement**: The final agreement included the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. The deal was announced after intense negotiations and pressure from various parties, including direct calls from President Trump.

- **Future Implications**: The success of the talks highlighted the importance of sustained pressure and clear mandates from leadership. The mediators focused on immediate issues like ceasefire and prisoner exchange rather than broader, more complex issues like full Israeli withdrawal and Hamas disarmament.
