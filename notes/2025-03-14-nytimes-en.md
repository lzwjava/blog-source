## Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs on China in Response to Rare Earth Restrictions

President Trump announced a 100% tariff on all Chinese goods starting November 1, in response to China's recent restrictions on rare-earth mineral exports. This move escalates tensions between the world's two largest economies. Trump also threatened to cancel a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and impose export controls on critical software. Markets reacted negatively, with the S&P 500 index dropping over 2% on Friday.

China's restrictions on rare-earth minerals, essential for various technologies, have been a focal point of U.S.-China tensions. Trump had previously imposed high tariffs on Chinese exports, which were later reduced after causing significant trade disruptions. China's latest measures include requiring licenses for exports containing Chinese-produced rare earths and new controls on equipment for electric car batteries.

The global implications of these restrictions are significant, affecting major companies like Nvidia and Apple. Tech stocks were particularly hard hit, with Nvidia down nearly 5% and AMD down nearly 8%. China also announced an antimonopoly investigation into Qualcomm and new fees for U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports.

Analysts suggest that China's actions could backfire, potentially leading to further U.S. measures to reduce dependence on the Chinese economy. The fragile détente between the two countries is at risk, with the planned summit between Trump and Xi in jeopardy. The U.S. is considering various countermeasures, including increased tariffs and export controls, to respond to China's actions.

## China Tightens Rare Earth Control Ahead of Xi-Trump Meeting

China has intensified its control over rare earth metals, announcing new export restrictions effective from December 1. These measures are part of Beijing's strategy to assert broader control over global semiconductor and high-tech manufacturing. Additionally, China will restrict exports of equipment needed for electric car battery manufacturing starting November 8, aiming to protect its competitive edge in the automotive industry.

The new rules could disrupt supply chains for major companies like Nvidia and Apple, as rare earths are crucial for producing computer chips used in various technologies, including smartphones and AI systems. China's Ministry of Commerce justified the measures to prevent rare earths from being used in military technologies, citing its monopoly on refining samarium, a rare earth used in U.S. military applications.

China's dominance in rare earth mining and processing is significant, and the new rules prohibit the transfer of technology and equipment that could help other countries establish their own rare earth production capabilities. This move has raised concerns among U.S. and European companies, which have been working to set up rare earth magnet factories but face a three-year ramp-up period to reach full production capacity.

The rules also give China's Ministry of Commerce broad authority to restrict exports of devices containing rare earths, such as electric motors and computer chips. This has led to concerns about China's potential control over the global AI and modern electronics supply chain.

The U.S. and European Union have expressed concerns over these restrictions, with the EU emphasizing the need for stable and predictable access to critical raw materials. China's actions are seen as a response to U.S. tariffs and export controls, and the move is part of a broader trade dispute between the two countries.

China has been gathering information on global rare earth usage and has required detailed tracings of shipments in Western supply chains since last October. The country refines 99% of the world's dysprosium, a rare earth used in heat-resistant capacitors for chips. The U.S. has been aware of its vulnerability in rare earths since 2010 but has made slow progress in developing alternatives.

The new rules could impact companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, SK Hynix, and Samsung, which are crucial for advanced AI systems. The rules' broad scope mirrors U.S. export controls on chip production using American technology, and China's move is seen as a response to U.S. "long-arm jurisdiction."

The new regulations restrict international shipments of products containing even a small percentage of Chinese rare earths, making it difficult for companies to comply. The importance of rare earths in advanced semiconductors and AI-related products highlights the strategic significance of China's control over these materials.

## China Advances Power Grid Upgrade: West-to-East Power Transmission, Constructing Ultra-High Voltage Transmission Network

China is rapidly upgrading its power grid with ultrahigh-voltage (UHV) lines to meet its growing demand for electricity, driven by the adoption of electric vehicles and high-speed rail. The longest UHV line stretches over 3,200 kilometers from northwest China to the populous southeast, transporting electricity generated by vast solar and wind farms. China has 41 such lines, each capable of carrying more electricity than any utility transmission line in the United States. This efficiency is due to advanced technology and centralized planning, which allows for minimal transmission losses.

China's aggressive push for clean energy has led to a significant increase in electricity demand. Half of the country's new cars are electric, and high-speed rail lines are entirely powered by electricity. In April, wind and solar energy provided over a quarter of China's power. However, much of this clean energy is produced in remote western regions, far from the densely populated east. To address this, China is upgrading its power grid to transport electricity more efficiently.

The country's central planners have been caught off guard by the rapid adoption of solar and wind energy, leading to the construction of the world's first nationwide grid of UHV power transmission lines. This contrasts sharply with the approach of some other countries, such as the United States under President Trump, which focused on fossil fuels and rolled back clean energy programs.

China's UHV lines use direct current technology, which allows for long-distance transmission with minimal losses. This has significant implications for global climate change efforts, as it helps China reduce its reliance on coal, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. China's coal consumption and emissions are among the highest in the world.

The development of China's UHV lines was accelerated by the global financial crisis in 2009 and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. These events led to increased investment in UHV projects and a shift away from nuclear power. The construction of these lines has helped China reduce toxic air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to an increase in life expectancy.

However, the rapid build-out of UHV lines has also created new vulnerabilities, particularly in mountainous regions where lines are closely bunched. This has raised concerns about potential disruptions due to natural disasters. Despite these challenges, China's top-down industrial planning and government control have allowed for faster construction compared to other countries.

The UHV lines have been met with some resistance from local residents, who have expressed concerns about static electricity and potential health risks. However, the lines are seen as important national projects, and construction has generally proceeded without significant opposition.

## The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: China's Clean Energy Network Testbed

China is constructing a vast network of clean energy infrastructure on the Tibetan Plateau, leveraging its high altitude, intense sunlight, and cold temperatures to produce low-cost renewable energy. This includes solar panels, wind turbines, and hydropower dams, which together provide nearly all the power needed for the region, including data centers for artificial intelligence development.

Despite being a major coal consumer, China has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and expand renewable energy sixfold. This contrasts with the U.S. under the Trump administration, which promotes fossil fuel exports. China's investments in solar, wind, and electric vehicle technologies aim to make it a global leader in renewable energy.

The Talatan Solar Park in Qinghai Province is the world's largest solar farm, covering 162 square miles and generating enough power for a major city like Chicago. The region's solar and wind power costs are 40% less than coal-fired power. China is also building high-altitude solar farms near Lhasa and plans to expand its data center capacity significantly by 2030.

The region's clean energy efforts are supported by hydropower projects, which balance solar and wind power to maintain steady electricity supply. Data centers in Qinghai benefit from lower cooling costs due to the cold climate, and excess solar power is used to pump water for hydropower generation at night.

China's clean energy initiatives are part of a broader strategy to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels and lead the global transition to renewable energy. The country's investments in clean energy technologies and infrastructure are transforming it into a major player in the global energy market.

## Israel Approves Gaza Ceasefire Agreement

Israel's government approved a cease-fire agreement brokered by President Trump, ending the two-year war in Gaza and paving the way for the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas. The agreement was announced after midnight in Israel and hours after both Trump and Hamas's chief negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, declared the war over. Trump plans to travel to the Middle East for the signing of the agreement and the subsequent exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners.

The initial agreement addresses only a few of the 20 points in Trump's proposed plan, leaving many difficult issues, such as the governance of postwar Gaza and Hamas's disarmament, for future negotiations. Despite the uncertainty, Israeli officials have stated that there is no intention to renew the war.

The United Nations is preparing to rush food, medicine, and other aid to Gaza, where severe hunger has taken hold. The war, which began in October 2023 with a Hamas attack on southern Israel, has resulted in significant casualties and destruction. Over 67,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israeli soldiers have been killed, and the territory's infrastructure has been largely destroyed.

Hamas faces significant risks in agreeing to the deal, as it gives up much of its leverage with Israel. While the agreement achieves the release of Palestinian prisoners, it does not guarantee an end to the war and only provides for a partial Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Palestinians in Gaza welcomed the agreement but remain uncertain about its implications for their devastated communities.

## U.S. Fires Diplomat for Hiding Relationship with Daughter of Chinese Official

The U.S. State Department fired a diplomat for concealing a romantic relationship with a Chinese woman who is the daughter of a Chinese Communist Party official. The diplomat, a foreign service officer, was required to disclose such contacts but did not. The State Department did not name the diplomat, but a spokesman confirmed the dismissal. President Trump approved the firing, which is the first under an executive order he signed in February aimed at reforming the Foreign Service. The incident has raised concerns about China's influence in the U.S., including issues like trade secret theft and hacking. The diplomat was recorded discussing the relationship with an undercover woman working for a conservative media figure. The Chinese government declined to comment, describing the matter as a domestic U.S. issue.

## Crackdown on Malicious Incitement of Negative Emotions

China's internet regulators are targeting content that spreads negative emotions and pessimistic views, punishing bloggers and influencers who post about topics like reduced work pressure, financial benefits of not marrying or having children, and China's lower quality of life compared to Western countries. This crackdown, part of a two-month campaign, aims to eliminate content that incites pessimism, panic, and defeatist ideas. The campaign is driven by concerns about economic uncertainty, rivalry with the United States, and growing disenchantment among young people, who are increasingly adopting a "lying flat" lifestyle or giving up on goals altogether. The government is worried that such pessimism could turn into criticism of the ruling Communist Party. Local governments and social media platforms are actively enforcing these regulations, suspending or banning accounts that spread negative information. The campaign also targets posts that use isolated news events to highlight broader social problems, which the authorities condemn as "malicious misinterpretation." Despite these efforts, many people in China continue to express genuine frustrations about economic issues and social inequality.

## Chinese-American Businessman Accused of "Proxy Donating" for Chinese Citizens to Support Trump Campaign

A Chinese American businessman, Xinyue Lou, is on trial in a Brooklyn federal court for allegedly orchestrating a scheme to funnel money from a Chinese national to support Donald Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. Lou, also known as Daniel, recruited "straw donors" to make contributions on behalf of an unnamed Chinese national who wanted to attend a Trump fundraiser and take a photo with the then-president. Prosecutors allege that Lou's actions were criminal, as he sought to circumvent campaign contribution limits by concealing the true source of the donations.

Lou's case is part of a broader Justice Department investigation into illegal contributions made by Chinese nationals during the 2020 election. The trial comes as Trump's Justice Department is handling the case, which was initially charged under President Biden. Federal prosecutors have sought to prevent Lou's lawyers from arguing that he was a victim of selective prosecution due to his support for Trump. Lou's lawyers, however, have tried to exclude certain evidence, including witness statements, that suggest Lou was coordinating efforts to steer Chinese funds to Trump's campaign.

Lou has contributed nearly $100,000 to Trump's re-election efforts and other Republican causes since 2016. Prosecutors plan to present emails and messages between Lou and an unnamed co-conspirator, as well as communications with the recruited donors, to show the extent of the scheme. Lou has expressed disappointment that the Chinese nationals on his guest list were not allowed to take a photo with Trump due to their foreign status. The trial is expected to last one week.

## Youth's Cry: The Voice of Protest Ignites the "Asian Spring"

A new visual language of resistance is emerging across South and Southeast Asia, driven by young people who feel marginalized and pushed to the brink. This movement, fueled by social media, has seen significant uprisings in countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Nepal. The protests are a response to widespread issues such as youth unemployment, economic crises, and corruption.

The lack of organized leftist or progressive movements has left a void that young people are filling through digital solidarity. Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok are playing a crucial role in coordinating these protests. However, the absence of clear leadership and ideology means that the movements often lack a cohesive vision beyond immediate grievances.

The protests have turned violent in response to state brutality, leading to greater mobilization and radicalization. In Nepal, for example, peaceful protests turned violent after police opened fire on demonstrators. Similarly, in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, state violence was a tipping point for escalating unrest.

The article warns that without credible leftist or progressive alternatives, the current wave of protests could lead to chaos, including military coups and sectarian violence. However, it also notes that Asia's Generation Z is treating digital organizing as a core part of their political strategy, building decentralized and effective movements from scratch.

The author concludes that this new generation is finding its voice and that those in power ignore it at their peril.

## Is China's Farewell to Green "Involution" a Blessing or a Curse?

China's rapid advancement in green technology, particularly solar power, has been a significant driver of global renewable energy growth. However, recent shifts in China's industrial strategy, including a move away from ruthless price competition, could slow down this progress. This change, known as ending "involution," aims to focus on higher-quality, more sustainable practices. The implications for climate action and geopolitics are significant. China's dominance in green tech has made the U.S. and Europe seem less influential in climate politics. The U.S. is now grappling with its own economic and technological challenges, including a potential shift towards a more state-driven economic model. The rivalry between the U.S. and China in green technology and other sectors is evolving, with both countries vying for global leadership in a new eco-ideological Cold War. The future of the planet's energy transition hangs in the balance as these geopolitical dynamics unfold.

## Fearful China

China's intense market competition, particularly in sectors like electric vehicles, solar panels, and lithium batteries, has led to price wars, losses, and bad debt. This situation is pushing China toward deflation, reminiscent of Japan's economic struggles in the 1990s. Chinese leaders attribute this to "involution," a term describing reckless domestic competition, and are attempting to control it through administrative measures. However, these efforts are seen as temporary fixes rather than addressing the root cause of excessive reliance on investment over consumer spending.

The term "involution" gained traction during the pandemic, reflecting young people's economic pressures. Initially dismissed by older commentators, it became a significant concern in 2024 when Chinese manufacturers faced massive losses and exported goods at prices that provoked tariffs from the U.S. and Europe. The Chinese government has since prioritized combating involution, framing it as a domestic issue rather than a response to Western pressure.

China's approach to managing oversupply differs from the U.S., relying on government control rather than market mechanisms. Recent interventions, such as warnings to carmakers and bankers against excessive price cutting and plans to create a polysilicon cartel, are seen as short-lived. Longstanding policies encouraging excess supply remain unchanged, and local officials are still measured by economic growth and social stability.

To truly address the issue, China needs to boost domestic spending, which would absorb excess supply. However, China has resisted this approach, preferring to maintain state control over the economy. The risk is that China could follow Japan into a prolonged period of economic stagnation.

## Bull Market Returns: AI Drives China's Stock Market Rally

China's stock markets are experiencing a bullish run driven by artificial intelligence (AI), similar to trends in the United States and other regions. This shift is notable because previous market movements were largely influenced by government policy changes. Key companies in China's AI sector, such as Alibaba and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, have seen significant stock price increases, with Alibaba up over 120% and SMIC up around 180% this year. Other tech giants like Baidu, Tencent, and Xiaomi have also seen substantial gains.

The MSCI China Index, which tracks the country's largest companies, has risen over 40% this year, outperforming similar U.S. indexes. Tech companies now dominate the Chinese index, with Tencent, Alibaba, and Xiaomi accounting for about 30% of its value. This trend is supported by strong government backing, vast data resources, and significant investments in AI infrastructure by both private and public sectors.

The competition between China and the U.S. in AI has further boosted market optimism. Recent regulatory moves, such as China's push for domestic chip usage in data centers, have been seen as signals of China's intent to build a self-sufficient AI ecosystem. This has attracted interest from tech companies looking to go public in Shanghai or Hong Kong, with recent approvals and plans for listings by companies like Moore Threads and Unitree Robotics.

## What Happened to the Unexpected Withdrawal of the British Spy Case Involving China?

Two men, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, were accused of spying for China and were scheduled to stand trial in London. However, the case was unexpectedly dropped by prosecutors last month. The case hinged on the interpretation of the word "enemy" in the Official Secrets Act of 1911, which criminalizes information gathering useful to an enemy. A legal dispute involving a Bulgarian group accused of spying for Russia led to a Court of Appeal ruling that an enemy nation could be one that poses a current threat to the UK's national security, excluding friendly powers.

The prosecution faced a challenge in proving that China was viewed as a threat to Britain’s national security during the period in question (December 2021 to February 2023), as the government at the time did not classify China as an adversary. The government had referred to China as a "systemic competitor" in 2021 and an "epoch-defining and systemic challenge" in 2023. The prosecution struggled to secure government statements to meet the updated legal test, leading to the case's collapse.

Political figures, including Alicia Kearns, have accused the government of undermining the prosecution to appease Beijing. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, however, attributed the collapse to procedural issues. Critics argue that the government could have provided witness statements to help the prosecution, suggesting a motive to protect trade ties with China.

The issue that led to the case's collapse is unlikely to recur, as the Official Secrets Act has been replaced by the National Security Act, which applies to any foreign power, not just enemy states. This new law allows for espionage prosecutions without the need for the UK to be at war or facing an imminent threat.

The episode highlights the broader dilemma for the UK in dealing with China: balancing economic interests with national security. The Labour Party, which won the 2024 general election, has stated its intention to cooperate, compete, and challenge China as necessary. Despite efforts to improve relations, concerns about China's actions, such as the crackdown in Hong Kong and cyberattacks, have led to increased alarm within the UK's security services.

## Gig Workers in the Gig Economy: Delivery Riders in a 70-Story Building in Shenzhen

In Shenzhen, China, the tall SEG Plaza building with around 70 floors and thousands of tenants faces a significant challenge during lunch hours: long elevator waits. This issue is addressed by a unique gig economy solution involving delivery runners like 16-year-old Li Linxing, who take over the final leg of the delivery from the main delivery drivers. These runners, often retirees or teenagers, wait outside the building to receive orders from delivery drivers, who pay them a small fee to deliver the food to the correct floor. This system, though lucrative for the runners, is essential for the drivers to maximize their efficiency and meet the high demand for deliveries.

The runners, who typically earn around 100 yuan (about $14) a day, face a competitive environment. Some runners have developed efficient techniques, such as waiting until they have multiple orders before heading upstairs. The system is part of Shenzhen's entrepreneurial spirit, where individuals meet specific needs within the gig economy. The arrangement is particularly beneficial during the pandemic, as it allows for faster and more reliable deliveries.

One notable figure in this system is Shao Ziyou, who started the practice and now subcontracts the actual running to a dozen people. Despite the competitive nature of the work, the atmosphere remains generally civil, with enough orders to go around. However, the involvement of children in this gig economy raised safety concerns, leading to a local government ban on child labor in deliveries. The legal age for regular employment in China is 16, allowing Li Linxing to continue working until he finds a more stable job, such as a factory position.

## Why American Companies "Kowtow" to Trump

The article discusses why American corporations have been yielding to pressure from former President Donald Trump. Despite initial resistance, many companies have ultimately capitulated to Trump's demands, as seen in instances like Disney's decision to remove a talk-show host and various law firms cutting deals with the White House. The fear of further retaliation and the potential for personal targeting are cited as primary reasons for this capitulation.

The article highlights that collective action is crucial for companies to resist government coercion effectively. However, the culture of American business has shifted over the past few decades, making collective action more difficult. The rise of shareholder capitalism has led to increased competition and a focus on short-term gains, which has eroded the sense of collective responsibility and civic-mindedness that once characterized the business elite.

Historically, the business world was more cohesive, with leaders from various industries collaborating through organizations like the Committee for Economic Development and the Business Council. This collective approach allowed them to influence economic policies and maintain social order. However, the deregulation of industries and the shift towards shareholder capitalism have fragmented this unity, making it harder for companies to stand together against external pressures.

The article concludes by noting that while corporations are more powerful than ever, they are also more vulnerable to external pressures, especially from a president determined to bend them to his will. The competitive nature of modern business and the focus on individual gains have made it difficult for companies to resist such pressures collectively.

## China's Ministry of State Security: Rise to a Powerful Cyber Espionage Agency

In 2023, U.S. officials discovered that Chinese state-controlled hackers had infiltrated critical U.S. infrastructure with malicious code, prompting a secret meeting between CIA Director William J. Burns and China's Minister of State Security. Despite the meeting, China's cyber intrusions have escalated. The Ministry of State Security (MSS) has emerged as a key player in China's sophisticated cyber operations, including a massive intrusion by a group called Salt Typhoon, which targeted nearly every American and dozens of other countries.

The MSS has evolved from a focus on tracking dissidents to a formidable cyberespionage agency under Xi Jinping's leadership. Xi reshaped the MSS, purging corrupt officials and elevating it as the primary cyberespionage agency. The MSS now operates with tighter central control and has developed a robust talent pipeline for offensive hacking.

China's cyber advances reflect decades of investment to rival the U.S. National Security Agency and Britain's GCHQ. The MSS operates largely in the shadows, with officials like Wu Shizhong playing crucial roles in developing cyber capabilities. Wu, who headed the technical reconnaissance arm of the MSS, emphasized the importance of technical prowess and exploiting vulnerabilities.

China's commercial tech sector has boomed, and state security officials have leveraged domestic companies to spot and exploit flaws in computer systems. The MSS benefits from a policy requiring newly found software vulnerabilities to be reported to a state-controlled database, giving security officials early access. This arrangement is seen as prestigious and beneficial for companies' reputations.

The MSS's capabilities pose a significant threat to U.S. communications, power, and infrastructure in a future conflict. Experts warn that China's strategic cyber operations are intended to intimidate and deter rivals, providing a significant advantage in a crisis.

## The Passing of John K. Gong: A U.S. Lawyer Who Deeply Plowed the Chinese Legal Field

Jerome A. Cohen, a pioneering figure in the study of China's legal system, died at 95. He was one of the first foreign lawyers to practice in China and was known for his advocacy against human rights abuses. Cohen's career spanned academia and legal practice, and he was instrumental in shaping the field of Chinese law studies in the United States. He taught at Harvard Law School and later at New York University, where he founded the U.S.-Asia Law Institute. Cohen's work included advising foreign companies and educating Chinese officials on commercial law. He remained vocal about China's repressive policies under President Xi Jinping until his death. His contributions were widely recognized, and he was remembered for his generosity and dedication to legal and human rights causes.

## The Cure for "America First"? China Uses the UN Stage to Shape the Image of a Responsible Major Country

During a week of appearances at the United Nations, China aimed to portray itself as a responsible global power willing to take on international duties, contrasting with the U.S. under President Trump, who was seen as retreating from global responsibilities. China's leaders used the U.N. General Assembly to make pledges on trade and climate change, emphasizing China's role as a stable and cooperative global partner. Premier Li Qiang criticized unilateral and protectionist measures, contrasting them with China's commitment to opening its doors to the world. Xi Jinping announced China's first detailed target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, criticizing countries that hinder the transition to a green economy, a clear reference to the U.S. Trump had previously mocked climate change as a "con job."

China's strategy is to position itself as an antidote to "America First," promoting "true multilateralism" by embracing international organizations and treaties shunned by Trump. Experts note that China is seizing opportunities where the U.S. has left leadership vacuums, such as in climate issues. However, the effectiveness of China's actions remains debated, with some experts arguing that China's pledges fall short of what is needed to address global warming effectively. China's definition of itself as a developing country, despite its economic size, adds complexity to its international stance. While China has pledged to forgo certain trade benefits at the WTO, it continues to assert its status as a developing nation, a stance criticized by the U.S. for allowing China to exploit global trading rules.
