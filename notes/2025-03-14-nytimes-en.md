## China's "Fujian" Aircraft Carrier Officially Commissioned, Further Challenging the United States

China's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has officially entered service, marking a significant step towards Beijing's goal of rivaling American naval power in the region. The Fujian, featuring an electromagnetic catapult system, was commissioned on Wednesday, with China's top leader, Xi Jinping, presiding over the ceremony on Hainan Island. Xi praised the pilots and highlighted the carrier's advanced technology, which was recently criticized by former U.S. President Trump.

The Fujian is China's third aircraft carrier and the most ambitious project to date. While China's carriers still lag behind the U.S. in number and sophistication, the Fujian is the first to approach U.S. carriers in size and capability. Satellite images suggest China is already building a fourth carrier, with plans to potentially shift to nuclear-powered carriers in the future.

The Fujian's deployment comes amid ongoing tensions between China and Taiwan, with some analysts suggesting it could be used to intimidate Taiwan or other countries with territorial disputes, especially in the South China Sea. However, experts note that carriers may not play a prominent role in initial military actions against Taiwan due to the island's proximity to China's coast and air bases.

China's military has signaled its determination to quickly master the art of operating large carriers and deploying aircraft from their decks. Despite these advancements, China still faces technological and personnel challenges in becoming a fully mature carrier power.

## Frequent Malicious Harm Incidents: Why Are Chinese Women Victims of Domestic Violence So Helpless?

In China, domestic violence victims often face systemic failures and cultural barriers that leave them unprotected. Despite a comprehensive anti-domestic violence law enacted in 2016, enforcement is inconsistent, and authorities often view domestic violence as a private family matter. This approach is exacerbated by a cultural emphasis on maintaining family stability, which discourages police and courts from intervening in violent situations.

Two recent cases highlight these issues. Zhang Liping, a 43-year-old woman, died from injuries inflicted by her ex-husband. Despite multiple reports to the police and the local women’s federation, no intervention was made. Similarly, another woman, identified as Ms. Xie, was severely injured by her husband after seeking a restraining order. The court initially rejected her application, citing jurisdictional issues, and she was later hospitalized with critical injuries.

The lack of proper training for police and administrative hurdles in the courts further complicate the situation. Additionally, the government's push to promote marriage and childbearing to boost the falling birth rate often conflicts with efforts to support domestic violence victims. Nonprofit groups that once provided aid and support to victims have been shut down, leaving many women without crucial resources.

The system's inadequacies and cultural pressures result in many women feeling helpless. The police often act as mediators rather than enforcers, and the broader societal view of family as a source of stability discourages intervention. This leaves victims with limited options and often forces them to seek help from local committees and federations that may not be equipped to handle their cases effectively.

## China's Rare Earth Monopoly and Its Impact on European Defense

European governments are accelerating military rearmament in response to an aggressive Russia and an isolationist America. However, this effort is hindered by China's dominance in the rare earth metals and permanent magnets market, which are crucial for military hardware. China has used this leverage in trade disputes, tightening or loosening export controls on rare earths.

The European Union is urgently seeking to secure its supply of these critical minerals, with the European Commission urging independence in this area. Despite negotiations with China, there is no guarantee of a quick or lasting solution. European leaders are aware that their military buildup heavily relies on an increasingly unstable relationship with China.

China's restrictions on rare earth exports have already caused shortages and price spikes, affecting key military technologies like F-35 fighter jets, drones, and missiles. The EU has passed legislation to develop a domestic rare earth industry, but replacing China's mining and refining capacity will take years.

The EU is also facing challenges in diversifying its supply, with only about half of the 2,000 export license applications from EU entities properly addressed by China. The U.S. is moving faster to invest in rare earth production, while European companies are uncertain if EU efforts to encourage a local supply chain will be timely and effective.

Diplomacy remains the main hope for securing rare earth supplies in the short term, as Europe struggles to turn its concerns into concrete actions. China's dominance in rare earths poses a significant threat to Europe's military rearmament plans, potentially disrupting geopolitical balances and future security.

## Musk's "Billion-Dollar Pay" Reflects U.S. Wealth Inequality

Tesla shareholders approved a compensation plan that could make Elon Musk the world's first trillionaire, just days after New Yorkers elected a candidate advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy. This juxtaposition highlights the stark divide in American society regarding wealth distribution. Tesla's shareholders, based in Austin, Texas, endorsed a "winner-takes-all" capitalist model, while New York voters, influenced by economic frustrations, supported a progressive candidate advocating for social welfare systems similar to those in Western Europe.

The compensation plan for Musk is structured to reward him with nearly $1 trillion in shares if Tesla achieves ambitious financial and operational goals over the next decade. This includes selling one million humanoid robots and 10 million subscriptions to self-driving software. Critics argue that the plan concentrates too much wealth and power in one person, while supporters see it as a way to motivate Musk to achieve groundbreaking innovations.

Musk's pay plan faced opposition from public pension fund managers in New York and California, who argued it would concentrate too much wealth and corporate power. Even Pope Francis weighed in, noting the growing disparity between working people and the wealthy. Despite the opposition, the plan was expected to pass, as similar, albeit smaller, executive stock packages have been approved in recent years.

Tesla's board of directors defended the plan, stating it was designed to supercharge the company's growth and innovation. However, some investors, including Norway's sovereign wealth fund, expressed concerns about the plan's size and potential risks. The plan allows Musk to vote his own shares, which could increase his control over the company to nearly 29% if he meets the plan's terms.

## Global Auto Industry Crisis Triggered by a Dutch-Chinese Chipmaker

A dispute over a Chinese-owned chipmaker in the Netherlands has led to a global shortage of semiconductors, causing automakers and their suppliers to scale back production. The Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, a chipmaker, over concerns about production moving to China. Beijing responded by halting chip exports from its factories, leading to supply chain disruptions. Efforts by the EU and Washington to resolve the issue have so far failed, raising concerns about potential production halts if a solution isn't found soon.

The dispute began when Nexperia, headquartered in the Netherlands, was acquired by a Chinese company, Wingtech, in 2019. The Dutch government's seizure of Nexperia was influenced by U.S. pressure regarding the company's ownership. The chip shortage affects not only the automotive industry but also other sectors like home appliances and military equipment.

The production process for semiconductors involves two steps: front-end production in Germany and back-end production in China. Replacing the chips is challenging due to the need for local production and certification. Industry experts warn that companies should have backup plans for such disruptions.

Major automakers like Mercedes, Stellantis, and Nissan have set up task forces to maintain production and secure alternative chip supplies. Bosch, Europe's largest auto parts supplier, has also faced significant challenges and may need to reduce employee hours. Nissan has announced production cuts at two Japanese plants due to the chip shortage.

The situation highlights the vulnerabilities in global supply chains and the potential impact of geopolitical tensions on manufacturing.

## China's Electric Vehicles at the UN Climate Change Conference

The article discusses the significance of China's electric vehicles (EVs) at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Belém, Brazil. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was transported in a Chinese-made BYD electric SUV, signaling Brazil's shift towards Chinese technology for its economic and environmental transformation. This move highlights China's advancements in climate technologies and the absence of the United States from the conference.

China's EVs are seen as crucial in reducing reliance on fossil fuels and eliminating carbon dioxide emissions. Chinese automakers have gained market share by offering advanced, affordable EVs, making them attractive in developing countries. China also controls the supply chains for critical minerals needed for EV batteries, which are abundant in Brazil and Latin America.

Chinese EVs have rapidly gained market share in Asia and Europe, and in Brazil, over 80% of electric vehicles sold are Chinese. Chinese automakers have significant plans for Latin America, with BYD and GWM setting up large factories in Brazil. The presence of electric vehicles in Brazilian cities, including Belém, is already transforming urban environments by reducing traffic pollution.

The article underscores the global impact of Chinese EV technology and China's strategic position in the EV market, contrasting with the absence of U.S. leadership in climate initiatives.

## The Tragedy of Dick Cheney

Dick Cheney, former Vice President, left a lasting legacy of expanding executive authority beyond constitutional limits and the rule of law. His actions, including the war on terror, mass surveillance, and tax cuts for the wealthy, set a precedent for future administrations, notably Donald Trump. Trump has further expanded these powers under dubious claims of emergency, essentially continuing Cheney's model without the actual war.

Cheney and Trump differ in their methods: Cheney was meticulous and long-term oriented, while Trump operates on instinct. Despite their differences, Trump's actions are a continuation of Cheney's legacy, which has undermined Americans' trust in their institutions and leaders.

Cheney's career spanned decades, including roles under Nixon, Ford, and Bush. His "1% doctrine" became a guiding principle for U.S. foreign policy, leading to significant loss of life and resources. His administration's disregard for truth and transparency, as seen in the Iraq War, had severe consequences for those who tried to reveal the truth.

Cheney's legacy includes the erosion of democratic norms and the creation of a political environment where Trump could thrive. Despite his late-in-life criticism of Trump, Cheney's actions paved the way for Trump's disregard for constitutional constraints.

## Trump's China Trade Policy Is Terrible

Trump's China trade policy has been ineffective and chaotic. He has used tariffs as leverage, but his approach has been disorganized and counterproductive. Trump's strategy has failed to achieve significant gains in reducing China's manufacturing exports to the U.S. due to his haphazard implementation of tariffs. China's economic situation, including a housing bubble burst and high debt levels, has led to reduced domestic consumption and increased exports. China's strategy to double down on industrial manufacturing, despite concerns from trading partners, poses risks for both countries. Trump's tariffs should be part of a comprehensive, quiet strategy, but his actions have been loud and ineffective. China's control over rare earth elements gives it significant leverage, which Trump underestimated. The U.S. needs a long-term, quiet dialogue with China to avoid a costly trade war.

## China's Shenzhou-20 spacecraft delays return due to suspected space debris collision

China has delayed the return of three astronauts from its space station due to a suspected debris strike on the Shenzhou-20 spacecraft. The China Manned Space Agency is conducting an analysis and risk assessment to ensure the safety of the astronauts. The mission, launched in April, has been in orbit for six months. The investigation will assess whether the debris caused any damage to critical systems, which could affect the spacecraft's re-entry.

Space debris has become a growing problem, exacerbated by the increasing number of satellites and rocket pieces in orbit. Antisatellite tests, such as one conducted by China in 2007, have also contributed to the issue. While larger objects are tracked and avoided, smaller debris, including micrometeroids, pose significant risks. Even small objects can cause substantial damage due to their high velocity.

The probability of collisions in space has increased with the deployment of large satellite constellations like SpaceX’s Starlink and Chinese equivalents. China is researching methods for the active removal of space debris. In extreme situations, China could launch an emergency spacecraft to rescue astronauts.

China's space program has made significant strides, moving from a late starter to a close second behind the U.S. The Shenzhou-20 crew has conducted spacewalks, handled cargo, and performed scientific experiments during their mission. They were joined by a relief crew aboard the Shenzhou-21, which is also docked at the Tiangong space station.

## Trump vs. Mamdani: An Impending Showdown

Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected mayor of New York City, is set for a confrontation with President Trump, who has publicly criticized Mamdani as an extremist and communist. Privately, Trump acknowledges Mamdani's political talent. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has vowed to defend New York City against federal interference and has challenged Trump directly. Trump, who has a vested interest in New York's financial success due to his real estate holdings, has threatened to withhold federal funds but faces legal constraints. Mamdani plans to hire additional lawyers to combat potential federal overreach. Trump's allies suggest he might use Mamdani as a political tool to demonize Democrats, while Mamdani remains defiant, promising to stand up for New York City's residents.

## Shein Accused of Selling Child Pornography Dolls, France Temporarily Bans Its Website

The French government has temporarily blocked access to the online retailer Shein after discovering child pornography-themed sex dolls on its platform, sparking nationwide outrage. The move, ordered by Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu, comes as Shein opened its first physical store in Paris, drawing both protesters and shoppers. Over 200 police officers were deployed to maintain order amidst the chaotic scene. Employees and union members at the BHV Marais department store expressed concerns about Shein's labor practices and environmental standards. The controversy has further fueled existing tensions over Shein's presence in France, where it is seen as a low-cost competitor using cheap labor and violating environmental standards. Shein has taken steps to remove the controversial products and expand its blacklist of search terms. Despite the backlash, Shein remains popular among consumers seeking affordable alternatives to expensive French brands.

## Mamdani's Stunning Political Comeback: Seven Key Points from New York Election Night

Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state lawmaker, won the New York City mayoral election with over 1 million votes, the highest since 1969. He built a new coalition of younger voters and working-class immigrant communities in Queens, while also making gains in working-class Black and Latino communities. Mamdani's victory was marked by high voter turnout, with over 2 million New Yorkers casting their ballots, nearly double the number from four years ago. He defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who had significant financial backing from super PACs, including billionaires like Bill Ackman and Michael Bloomberg. Despite Cuomo's efforts to sway Republican voters, Mamdani's campaign successfully framed the attacks as an example of the wealthy obstructing progress. Mamdani's win signifies a generational and ideological shift in New York City politics.

## China's Ministry of State Security's AI Vision: Enhancing Social Surveillance with Artificial Intelligence

China's security apparatus is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance social surveillance. At a Beijing conference, tech executives and government researchers showcased AI applications, including speech recognition software for ethnic-minority regions, robots for street patrols, and big data analytics to understand individuals' habits and mental states. The goal is to create a state capable of knowing, predicting, and controlling its citizens.

The U.S. has expressed concern over China's use of advanced computing for surveillance and repression, leading to restrictions on chip and semiconductor exports. Despite these challenges, Chinese companies like Huawei and Hikvision are developing homegrown alternatives. The scale and sophistication of China's surveillance system, which includes cameras, internet controls, and national ID requirements, are unparalleled.

China's "AI+ Action Plan" aims to integrate AI into every aspect of life, from education to healthcare. This initiative was evident at the security conference, where speakers highlighted the benefits of AI in surveillance. Chinese companies have a key advantage: access to vast amounts of data, which is crucial for training and refining AI systems. This data access has led to the development of more commercial products for companies that work with the police.

Human rights groups have criticized companies like iFlytek for aiding the government in surveillance and repression, particularly of minorities. Despite these concerns, companies present their technologies as beneficial, such as tracking missing children or combating identity fraud. However, they also emphasize the ability to target specific groups, including migrant workers and government complainants.

The pervasive nature of surveillance is more impactful than its technical prowess. People's belief in being watched can deter actions that the government might disapprove of. The effectiveness of surveillance technology is less important than its widespread presence.

## How Did the Democrats Win Two States? Trump's Economic Agenda Losing Its Edge

The article discusses the political implications of recent elections in Virginia and New Jersey, where Democratic victories highlighted the growing dissatisfaction with the economy under President Trump. Despite not being on the ballot, Trump was a central figure in the campaigns, with Democrats blaming him and his allies for economic woes. The results showed a significant shift in voter sentiment, with Trump's longstanding economic advantage eroding. Democrats won by focusing on high living costs and promising to address them, while Republicans struggled to maintain their economic narrative. The article also notes Trump's lavish spending on personal projects and his administration's economic policies, which have been criticized for not delivering on promises to lower costs. Polls indicate that voters are increasingly dissatisfied with Trump's handling of the economy, and Democrats are capitalizing on this discontent to gain political ground.

## China's Export Juggernaut Continues at High Speed Under Trump's Tariff Pressure

China's exports remain robust despite U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump, with other countries increasing their imports from China to compensate for the decline in American purchases. China has been proactive in diversifying its customer base and maintaining low prices through massive manufacturing investments. This strategy has allowed China to continue its dominance in global manufacturing, with exports on track to reach a new record this year.

The U.S. has seen significant reductions in imports from China across various sectors, including plastic goods, furniture, phones, and computers. However, China has redirected its exports to other regions, such as Africa, South America, Europe, and Asia, where demand for low-cost Chinese products remains high. This shift has led to increased trade imbalances in some countries but has also provided them with affordable technology for economic modernization.

China's ability to offset the loss of the U.S. market is not universal; certain sectors, like toys, have seen significant declines in exports due to the U.S. market's importance. The effectiveness of Trump's tariffs in stemming the flow of Chinese goods remains uncertain, as many countries, including those in Asia, continue to buy from China. The U.S. has also seen increased imports from other Asian countries, such as Thailand, Taiwan, and Singapore.

Trump's recent reduction in tariffs may stabilize China's exports to the U.S., but his administration is considering additional tariffs on industries dominated by China. The ongoing trade tensions and China's strategic adjustments are part of a broader, unpredictable transformation in global trade dynamics.

## New York City Mayoral Election: Mamdani Defeats Former Governor Cuomo

Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state lawmaker, was elected the 111th mayor of New York City. His victory, which spanned from gentrified areas of Brooklyn to working-class immigrant enclaves in Queens, marked one of the most significant political upsets in New York history. Mamdani defeated former Governor Andrew M. Cuomo in a rematch of the June Democratic primary, with Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa finishing a distant third.

Mamdani's campaign focused on affordability, social media mastery, and infectious optimism, which galvanized record turnout among young voters and immigrant groups. He will be the youngest mayor since the 19th century, the first Muslim and South Asian mayor, and the first naturalized immigrant to serve as mayor since the 1970s.

Mamdani's policies include raising taxes on the wealthy, making buses and child care free, freezing rent for rent-stabilized apartments, and overhauling the Police Department. However, he faces challenges such as funding from Governor Kathy Hochul and Albany lawmakers, as well as mistrust from many Jewish New Yorkers and business leaders. President Trump has also targeted Mamdani, threatening to cut federal funds and deploy the National Guard if Mamdani pursues policies Trump dislikes.

The election results followed a tumultuous period for New York City, including the indictment of Mayor Eric Adams on federal corruption charges. The campaign was marked by accusations of antisemitism and Islamophobia, with Cuomo portraying Mamdani as a far-left radical and Mamdani accusing Cuomo of selling out the city to big-money donors.

Other notable results include Alvin Bragg's re-election as the district attorney in Manhattan and voters considering six proposals, including three on housing development.

## Former North Korean Leader Kim Yong-nam Dies: Three-Term Loyalist to the Kim Family

Kim Yong-nam, North Korea's long-time ceremonial head of state, died at 97. His loyalty to the ruling Kim family allowed him to serve three generations of leaders and avoid political purges. He held various high-ranking positions, including serving on the Politburo from 1978 to 2019. Kim Jong-un, the current leader, visited Kim Yong-nam's bier to express condolences. Kim Yong-nam's career spanned the reigns of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un. He was known for his ability to stay in favor with the ruling family and his role in North Korean diplomacy, including leading delegations overseas and receiving foreign diplomats. Despite his high position, he always operated in the shadow of the ruling Kim family. Kim Yong-nam was born in 1928 and joined North Korea’s foreign service in the 1950s after studying in Moscow. He survived multiple crises in North Korean diplomacy and helped Kim Jong-un establish his leadership after his father's death. In 2018, he led a North Korean delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, which helped thaw inter-Korean relations.

## China Has Long Been on the Path of Economic "Decoupling" from the US

China has been systematically pursuing economic self-reliance for over two decades, reducing its dependence on the United States and other Western countries. This strategy has allowed China to establish choke points that can pressure the U.S. economy while making it harder for the U.S. to block China's development. Key policies include replacing imported manufactured goods with domestic production, even if it is costly and inefficient. This has diminished the West's leverage in disputes.

China's leaders have increasingly emphasized self-reliance, particularly in science and technology. The country's control over rare-earth metals and other critical supplies has given it significant leverage. For instance, China's threat to restrict rare-earth exports led to a compromise with the Trump administration, which suspended plans to expand restrictions on Chinese companies.

China's manufacturing self-reliance has extended to various sectors, including pharmaceuticals, electrical equipment, and low-end computer chips. This has left the U.S. with fewer options for retaliation. China's state-controlled banking system has supported this effort by providing low-interest loans to manufacturers of electric cars and solar panels, making China the largest exporter of these goods.

Despite progress, China still lags in producing the fastest semiconductors needed for advanced technologies. However, Chinese companies have shown adeptness in acquiring and smuggling high-end microchips. Policies like "Indigenous Innovation," "Made in China 2025," and the "high-quality productive forces" initiative have further driven domestic production.

China's protectionist trade policies, such as high tariffs on imported cars, have discouraged imports and encouraged domestic consumption of electric and hybrid vehicles. The country's leaders are determined to pursue even greater self-reliance, aiming to break bottlenecks and strengthen weaknesses. This strategy has made China a formidable economic player, challenging the U.S. and other Western countries.

## Will the US Resume Nuclear Explosive Testing? Trump and Officials Disagree

President Trump has repeatedly stated that he has ordered a resumption of explosive nuclear testing, which the U.S. has not conducted for 33 years, to counter alleged secret underground nuclear detonations by Russia, China, and other nuclear-armed states. This claim has been disputed by many nuclear experts and Trump's own nominee to lead the U.S. Strategic Command. Trump's energy secretary, Chris Wright, contradicted Trump by stating that the U.S. has no intention of conducting new explosive tests and will continue regular testing of nuclear components and systems.

The debate comes at a critical time as the U.S. struggles to update its nuclear arsenal, with programs facing delays and cost overruns. The discussion highlights a broader argument over whether full nuclear detonations are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of updated nuclear systems. The mixed messages from Trump and Wright have raised concerns about the U.S. government's handling of nuclear weapons and the potential for provoking other nations to resume testing.

## Starbucks Sells 60% Stake in China Business

Starbucks has agreed to sell up to 60% of its retail operations in China to Boyu Capital, a private equity firm, in a deal valued at $4 billion. The agreement involves a joint venture where Starbucks will retain ownership and licensing of its brand and intellectual property. Starbucks expects the value of its retail business in China to exceed $13 billion, including proceeds from the sale, its remaining 40% stake, and expected licensing fees over the next decade. The joint venture is set to be finalized in early 2026.

China has been a significant market for Starbucks since it opened its first shop in 1999. However, recent years have seen a shift in consumer preferences towards local brands, leading to a decline in Starbucks' market share. This strategic move aims to leverage Boyu Capital's local expertise and market knowledge to bolster Starbucks' position in China.

Starbucks' struggles in China come amid broader challenges, including a 17% drop in stock price over the past year and significant layoffs and store closures in the U.S. The company reported a 5.5% increase in global revenue but an 85% drop in net income. Starbucks' CEO, Brian Niccol, has been focusing on reviving the company's U.S. business but acknowledges the need for strategic partnerships to grow in China.
