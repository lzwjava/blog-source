## What Price Will China's Green Energy Ambition Bring to the World?

China's green-tech ambitions are transforming the global energy landscape, with significant implications for both climate change and geopolitics. China has become the world's largest producer of electric vehicles, wind turbines, and battery capacity, investing $625 billion in clean tech in 2024. This dominance is evident in projects like the Monsoon Wind Power Project in Laos, which is the largest onshore wind farm in Southeast Asia. The project, built by PowerChina, will save over 32 million tons of carbon emissions over 25 years, but all the electricity generated will be sold to Vietnam, highlighting Laos' role as a regional energy exporter.

China's clean-energy exports are having a global impact, with low-cost technologies reaching nearly every corner of the world. These exports are reducing global carbon emissions, with China's 2024 clean-tech exports alone representing a 1% reduction in global emissions outside China. However, this growth is also raising concerns about dependence and debt, particularly in countries like Laos, which is struggling with significant external debt, much of it owed to China.

The U.S. and China are moving in opposite directions regarding clean energy. While the U.S. has scaled back support for wind, solar, and electric vehicles, China is strengthening its hold on the supply chains for renewable energy. This shift is part of a broader geopolitical competition, with China aiming to use clean energy as a tool for economic growth and geopolitical influence.

China's approach to clean energy is driven by both environmental concerns and strategic interests, including energy security and economic growth. However, the country's dominance in clean tech has not yet translated into significant soft power, as China's exports are primarily focused on selling products rather than building local clean-tech economies.

The article highlights the complex dynamics of China's clean-energy ambitions, including the potential for a green Marshall Plan to drive global green development and strengthen China's international leadership. However, Beijing seems reluctant to make such a commitment, and China's continued reliance on coal and oil remains a significant challenge.

## China's First Commitment to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions

China has announced its first detailed target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, aiming to cut carbon dioxide and other pollutants by 7 to 10 percent by 2035. This announcement was made by President Xi Jinping at a United Nations climate summit. Previously, China had only pledged to peak its emissions around 2030, but recent studies suggest that emissions have already plateaued, five years earlier than expected.

Xi also stated that China will increase the proportion of non-fossil fuels in its energy system to over 30 percent within the next decade, focusing on solar, wind, and hydropower. China plans to expand its wind and solar capacity sixfold from 2020 levels, reaching 3,600 gigawatts, and aims to make electric cars mainstream in new sales.

China's new climate targets are significant because it is the world's largest polluter. The country's actions are crucial for slowing global warming. China's efforts contrast sharply with the United States' stance, which has contributed the largest share of emissions since the industrial era but has repudiated climate action under the Trump administration.

Climate advocates note that China's steps alone are not sufficient to meet the Paris Agreement's goals but suggest that China may exceed its targets. China has become a global leader in clean energy, investing heavily in renewable energy projects worldwide. This transformation is reshaping the global economy and geopolitics.

China dominates the production of key minerals for renewable energy technology and leads in the production of solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries. The scale of its production has driven down prices, making solar and wind energy cheaper than fossil fuel-based power in many countries.

China's energy trajectory mirrors its rise as a global power. Initially, it became the world's factory by burning vast amounts of coal. Now, it is rapidly adding renewable energy to its grid, with 2023's solar power capacity addition surpassing the total built by the United States. Independent analysts see a significant tipping point in China's emissions trajectory, with signs that emissions are flattening out.

China has also stopped building or financing coal projects abroad, focusing instead on promoting clean energy technologies. This shift is crucial for global efforts to limit temperature increases to manageable levels, as agreed by global scientific consensus.

## China's Industrial Robot Annual Installation Exceeds the Rest of the World

China is leading the world in the installation and manufacturing of industrial robots, surpassing all other countries combined. Last year, China had over two million robots in its factories and installed nearly 300,000 new ones, compared to 34,000 in the United States. This rapid adoption of robotics has been driven by government policies and investments, which have also boosted China's capabilities in making robots and integrating them with artificial intelligence.

The country's push for factory automation has significantly contributed to its status as the world's leading manufacturing powerhouse. Since 2017, China has installed over 150,000 robots annually, and by the start of this year, it produced nearly a third of all manufactured goods globally. This growth has been supported by extensive government backing, including low-interest loans, direct financial support, and strategic acquisitions.

China's strategy has been highly effective, with the country now manufacturing a third of the world's robots, surpassing Japan. The government's support has also spurred the development of start-ups and a robust ecosystem for specialized robot components. However, China still lags behind in producing certain key components for humanoid robots, which remain largely experimental.

Despite these challenges, China's advantages in skilled labor and AI integration make it a formidable player in the global robotics market. The country's focus on using AI to optimize factory performance sets it apart from other nations, positioning it as a leader in industrial automation.

## Trump Signs Executive Order to Clear Path for TikTok Deal

President Trump signed an executive order to facilitate a deal allowing a coalition of investors to run an American version of TikTok, separate from its Chinese owner, ByteDance. This move aims to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. while addressing concerns about data security and propaganda. The deal, valued at $14 billion, involves American investors and companies, including Oracle and Silver Lake, with an Emirati investment firm, MGX, also expected to join. The order extends the negotiation period until mid-January to finalize the deal. Trump emphasized that the investors are American, but the involvement of MGX raises questions about foreign influence. The Emirati firm's investment in a cryptocurrency startup founded by the Trump family and the sale of AI chips to the Emirates highlight the complex geopolitical dynamics at play. Democratic senators have called for investigations into potential ethical violations by the Trump administration in these deals.

## Live Coverage: "Hua Jia Sha" Crossing, Submerged Taiwan Guangfu Village

Typhoon Ragasa, the most powerful storm of the year, caused severe flooding in Guangfu, a rural town in Taiwan's Hualien County. The storm, which did not make landfall, led to the bursting of a lake dam, resulting in torrents of water that inundated the town. By Wednesday, at least 14 people were confirmed dead, and 17 were missing. The town, known for its agriculture and tourism, suffered significant damage, with over 700 acres of farmland submerged and millions of dollars in expected losses. Residents and business owners struggled to salvage their properties, and many were forced to take refuge on higher levels. The typhoon's heavy rainfall, exacerbated by rising sea and atmospheric temperatures, caused extensive damage and loss of life. Officials are investigating why evacuation orders were not fully followed, and the government is providing aid and support to the affected residents.

## “Your Country Is Going to Hell”: Trump "Insults" the World

Trump delivered a 56-minute speech at the United Nations, criticizing environmentalists, insulting the Muslim mayor of London, and attacking allies and foes globally. He questioned the purpose of the United Nations and claimed that the organization should not exist. Trump also aired various grievances, including a malfunctioning escalator at the U.N., his failure to win a renovation contract, windmills, and other countries' immigration policies. He announced a new effort to enforce the biological weapons convention using AI verification and called for a cessation of nuclear weapons development. Trump warned that the U.S. military would continue to act as judge, jury, and executioner in killing suspected drug smugglers. He spent a significant portion of his speech attacking efforts to address climate change, calling it a "greatest con job" and claiming environmentalists want to eliminate America’s cows. Trump also falsely claimed that Muslim leaders in the West are planning to institute Shariah law and proclaimed Christianity as the "most persecuted religion on the planet." He met with various world leaders, including President Zelensky of Ukraine, and made a surprising pivot on Ukraine, supporting its efforts to regain its original form.

## Super Typhoon "Hagibis" Sweeps Through Hong Kong, Taiwan and Other Areas, Causing Multiple Deaths

Typhoon Ragasa, a powerful storm, caused significant damage and loss of life as it swept through the Philippines, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The typhoon reached sustained wind speeds of 165 miles per hour, making it the strongest storm of the year. In Guangdong Province, China, over one million people were evacuated, and the Chinese government allocated $21 million for disaster relief. The storm made landfall on Hailing Island, causing widespread destruction and flooding.

In Hong Kong, the typhoon toppled hundreds of trees and flooded coastal areas, injuring 90 people. The storm also caused severe damage in Taiwan, where it collapsed a bridge and left 14 people dead and 17 missing. Videos showed people trapped in their homes and cars being swept away by floodwaters.

The typhoon's impact was exacerbated by climate change, which has led to higher sea and atmospheric temperatures, resulting in heavier rainfall during typhoons. Hong Kong had prepared for the worst, closing Disneyland, canceling horse races, and suspending classes. Over 600 flights were canceled at Hong Kong International Airport, and Shenzhen's airport suspended flights temporarily.

The storm is expected to continue westward, potentially reaching Vietnam and Laos later in the week, though it is likely to weaken. Areas previously affected by the typhoon, such as the Philippines, are still dealing with the aftermath, with 40,000 people remaining in evacuation centers and significant infrastructure damage reported.

## Youth's Cry: The Voice of Protest Ignites "Asian Spring"

A new wave of resistance is sweeping across South and Southeast Asia, driven by young people who are using social media to organize and express their grievances. This movement, reminiscent of the Arab Spring, is fueled by widespread youth unemployment, economic crises, and corruption. Countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Nepal have seen significant unrest, with protesters targeting symbols of power such as parliament buildings and presidential palaces.

The lack of organized leftist or progressive movements has left a void, which young people are filling through digital solidarity. Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok are playing a crucial role in mobilizing these protests. However, the absence of clear leadership and ideology means that the protests often lack a cohesive vision for post-revolution change.

The protests have turned violent in response to state brutality, leading to further radicalization. In Nepal, for example, peaceful protests turned violent after police opened fire on demonstrators. Similarly, in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, state violence has been a major catalyst for escalating unrest. The internet censorship intended to suppress these movements has backfired, pushing more young people onto the streets.

The article warns that without credible leftist or progressive alternatives, the current unrest could lead to chaos, military coups, and sectarian violence. However, it also notes that Asia's Generation Z is treating digital organizing as a core part of their political strategy, building decentralized and effective movements from scratch. This new approach could signal a different outcome compared to the Arab Spring.

## Is China's Farewell to Green "Involution" a Blessing or a Curse?

China's rapid advancement in green technology, particularly solar power, has been a significant driver of global renewable energy growth. The country has installed more solar capacity than the United States and other nations combined, and has invested heavily in green manufacturing abroad. However, recent developments suggest a potential slowdown in China's green initiatives due to issues like "involution," where intense price competition has led to low profitability for domestic companies. President Xi Jinping has called for an end to this internal competition and a shift towards a new industrial strategy.

This shift has geopolitical and economic implications. The U.S. and other Western nations, which have traditionally led in climate action, now face a rival force in China that is driving the global energy transition. This has led to a sense of envy and awe among some Americans, who see China's progress as both impressive and daunting. The U.S. has also faced challenges in maintaining its technological edge, particularly in the realm of high-end chips, where China has shown it can produce competitive products domestically.

The article highlights the potential for a new phase in the rivalry between the U.S. and China, with significant implications for global climate efforts and geopolitical dynamics. The future of the planet's energy transition hangs in the balance as these two powers navigate their respective strategies.

## Fearful Chinese Buzzword

China's intense market competition, particularly in sectors like electric vehicles, solar panels, and lithium batteries, has led to significant overproduction and price wars. This has resulted in economic issues such as deflation, losses, and bad debt. The Chinese government has identified this problem as "involution," a term originally used by anthropologist Clifford Geertz to describe a culture that fails to adapt and grow. The term gained popularity during the pandemic, reflecting the economic pressures felt by young people.

The government's response, including administrative measures to stabilize prices and reduce subsidies, is seen as a temporary fix rather than a fundamental solution. China's economy heavily relies on investment rather than consumer spending, leading to overproduction and trade wars. The government's efforts to address involution are framed as a way to avoid Western pressure, rather than as a response to excess capacity.

Historically, China has used similar campaigns to reduce overproduction, such as in the steel industry, but these efforts often resulted in increased production and higher tariffs from other countries. To truly address the issue, China needs to boost domestic spending, which would absorb the excess supply. However, the government is reluctant to reduce its control over the economy and increase consumer spending.

The risk is that China could follow Japan into a period of economic stagnation. The government's current approach may not be sufficient to drive growth, and there is a need for more substantial reforms to address the underlying issues.

## Trump's "Withdrawal" Creates Power Vacuum at UN, Authoritarian States Vie to Fill It

特朗普政府通过削减对联合国的资金支持和撤出多个联合国机构，制造了联合国的权力真空。中国、俄罗斯、伊朗、委内瑞拉等国家利用这一机会，试图填补这一真空，推动对人权调查的削减和其他有利于自身的政策。联合国面临严重的财政危机，许多机构和项目面临资金削减，甚至关闭。中国和卡塔尔等国家提出提供办公场地和资金支持，试图扩大其在联合国的影响力。美国的退出导致联合国人权和粮食援助项目面临严重资金短缺，影响到数百万人的生活。欧洲国家和中国都无法完全填补这一资金缺口。特朗普政府的行动削弱了美国在联合国的影响力，使得中国等国家有机会在国际事务中发挥更大作用。

## Chinese Communist Party's Transnational Pressure: Myanmar Curator Flees Thailand for "Offending China"

A curator from Myanmar, known as Sai, fled Thailand after a museum exhibition he curated in Bangkok was deemed too provocative by Chinese authorities. The exhibition, titled "Constellation of Complicity," criticized authoritarian governments, including those in China, Myanmar, and other countries. Two days after the exhibition opened in July, Sai received warnings from the museum's directors that Thai police were seeking his contact details. Fearing arrest and deportation back to Myanmar, Sai fled to London, leaving his belongings behind.

The exhibition included works from artists in politically sensitive regions like Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang. In response to pressure from Chinese authorities, the museum removed the names and works of four artists from these regions. The exhibition was not shut down, but the names of the artists were blacked out, and symbols of Tibetan and Uyghur independence were removed.

China has been known to pressure cultural institutions overseas to comply with its censorship requests. In this case, the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok faced no resistance from Thai officials. The Thai Foreign Ministry and Bangkok city officials warned the museum that the exhibition could cause diplomatic tensions with China. China's influence in Southeast Asia, as the largest trading partner for most countries in the region, including Thailand, was a significant factor.

The exhibition aimed to illustrate how authoritarian regimes cooperate on weapons, surveillance, trade, and repression. It also addressed a devastating civil war in Myanmar. Despite the censorship, some works from artists in Myanmar, Iran, Russia, and Syria remained unchanged. However, the focus of the censorship was entirely on artists from Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang.

The curator, Sai, plans to bring the exhibition to countries where it can be staged without censorship. He expressed no regrets about his actions, stating that he and his colleagues have always been aware of the risks involved in their work.

## China Seizes Opportunity as U.S. Withdraws from the UN

China has long sought greater influence in international bodies, and the U.S. reduction in funding for the United Nations and other global organizations presents an opportunity for Beijing to gain influence more cost-effectively. The Trump administration's cuts have exacerbated a pre-existing U.N. budget crisis, leading to widespread cuts. Chinese officials have criticized multilateral efforts on labor and minority rights as interference and have proposed scaling back human rights inquiries to save money. China has also positioned itself as a defender of global values while the U.S. retreats. The Chinese Embassy in Washington has stated that China does not intend to challenge or replace the U.S. in international institutions.

China has contributed to the U.N. budget crunch by paying dues late, but the U.S. retreat overshadows this issue. China has been filling gaps left by the U.S. in global aid, such as responding swiftly to the Myanmar earthquake and pledging $500 million to the World Health Organization after the U.S. withdrawal. The Trump administration's selective approach to the U.N. may lead to further U.S. withdrawals from U.N. agencies, potentially ceding influence to a loose alliance of largely undemocratic countries led by China. European diplomats fear that without U.S. presence, some U.N. agencies could be dominated by China and its allies.

## Rare Visit to China by US Congressional Delegation Warns of Dangerous Lack of Military Communication

A bipartisan delegation of U.S. House lawmakers, led by Rep. Adam Smith, visited China for the first time since 2019. The visit aimed to promote military communication between the U.S. and China to prevent potential conflicts. The delegation met with high-ranking Chinese officials, including Premier Li Qiang and Defense Minister Dong Jun. The visit came after a phone call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, where they discussed trade and TikTok. Despite efforts to stabilize relations, tensions remain over issues like China's military presence in the Pacific and near-miss incidents between U.S. and Chinese military assets. Smith emphasized the importance of regular military communication to avoid dangerous misunderstandings. The Chinese defense ministry expressed willingness to build a stable relationship with the U.S. military but also stressed China's commitment to defending its sovereignty. The delegation included members from both the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees. The visit was seen as a significant step in stabilizing U.S.-China relations, though challenges remain.

## America Following China's Footsteps? How Free Speech is Gradually Eroded

The article discusses the erosion of free speech in the United States under the Trump administration, drawing parallels with the experiences of China under Xi Jinping. It highlights how freedoms can be gradually chipped away, leading to a normalization of silence. The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show by ABC after pressure from the Trump administration is cited as a concerning example. The article compares this to China's systematic suppression of free speech, where journalists, social media, and even public grief are tightly controlled. The consequences of such control are illustrated through the story of Dr. Li Wenliang, whose warnings about the coronavirus were initially suppressed. The article warns that similar tactics in the U.S. could lead to a chilling effect on free speech, much like in China. It concludes by noting the alarming similarities between the two countries' approaches to silencing dissent.

## Trump: President Out of Step with Scientific Consensus

President Trump issued a warning to pregnant women about the unproven link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) and autism, advising them to avoid the medication. He disregarded the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' disagreement and has a history of providing flawed medical advice. Trump's stance contrasts with the FDA's guidance, which advises healthcare providers to consider risks and discuss them with patients. Scientific studies on the link between acetaminophen and autism are inconclusive. Experts worry about the impact of Trump's statements on public health messaging and patient trust in medical professionals. Trump's supporters applauded his focus on autism, but some, including former advisers, questioned the effectiveness and accuracy of his announcement.

## White House Says U.S. Will Gain Access to TikTok Algorithm and Retrain Copy

The White House announced a new deal to avert a ban on TikTok in the U.S. Oracle will oversee the security of American users' data and monitor updates to TikTok's recommendation algorithm. A copy of the algorithm will be licensed to an American investor group, which will operate TikTok in the U.S. Oracle and Silver Lake will invest in the new U.S.-run TikTok, ensuring it operates outside ByteDance's control. The U.S. version will retrain the algorithm using American user data, with China having no access to this data. The deal aims to meet national security concerns and comply with a law requiring TikTok to cut ties with ByteDance. American companies will own around 80% of the U.S. version, with ByteDance owning less than 20%. A board with national security credentials will oversee TikTok's U.S. operations, excluding ByteDance's representative from the security committee. The deal is similar to ByteDance's earlier "Project Texas" and has been extended for 120 more days for completion. Oracle promoted two executives to co-CEOs, and Safra Catz became the executive vice chair of Oracle's board.

## Searching for Rare Earth Magnet Alternatives: A Global Race

China's suspension of rare earth magnet exports has intensified global efforts to find alternatives. Four factories in the U.S. are nearing completion or starting production, and a large factory has opened in Eastern Europe. However, China's decades of investment have given it a significant lead, making it difficult for other countries to catch up quickly. China has used its control over rare earth magnet supplies to influence trade negotiations with the U.S. and EU, leading to more cautious approaches from these entities.

The global demand for rare earth magnets is high, with North America and Europe buying nearly 40,000 tons annually, almost all from China. China produces over 200,000 tons annually, integrating these magnets into its vast exports of manufactured goods. Companies outside Asia produce less than 2,000 tons annually, mainly in Germany and Finland, while Japanese companies produce an additional 25,000 tons in Japan and Vietnam.

Efforts to increase production outside China are underway but slow. VAC Group plans to open a factory in South Carolina with a capacity of nearly 2,000 tons a year. MP Materials is finishing a 1,000-ton factory in Texas and plans to expand to 10,000 tons. USA Rare Earth has built a factory in Oklahoma, and Noveon Magnetics has a factory near Austin, Texas. However, building and running these factories is complex and requires experienced technicians.

China's dominance is due to its control over the processing of rare earth minerals and its near-total control over the global supply of three crucial rare earths. Many countries, including the U.S., have long shipped their ore to China for refining. China also employs nearly all the world's technicians working in rare earth refineries and has restricted equipment exports.

Neo Performance Materials, a Canadian company, has opened a factory in Estonia that nearly doubles the available capacity of Europe and the U.S. to make magnets. However, even ramping up production to 2,000 tons may take three years due to the complexities involved. Neo's operations in Estonia are crucial for companies and countries trying to reduce their dependence on China's rare earth magnets.

## Trump Issues New H-1B Rules, $100,000 Visa Fee Sparks Chaos

President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 fee for certain high-skilled foreign worker visas, causing immediate confusion and chaos among Wall Street banks and tech companies. Employees at major firms like Microsoft, Amazon, and JPMorgan received notices advising those with H-1B visas outside the U.S. to return before the new rules took effect. The Trump administration later clarified that the fee only applies to new applicants, not renewals or current visa holders. Despite this, many companies and their legal teams remained cautious, urging employees to return to the U.S. as soon as possible. The policy change represents a significant overhaul of the H-1B visa program, which has been a contentious issue in the immigration debate. While the Trump administration aims to prioritize domestic hiring, business leaders worry about the impact on filling critical positions. The change is expected to face legal challenges, with the American Immigration Lawyers Association preparing a lawsuit. The new fee is also expected to affect workers in various industries, including medical, manufacturing, and academia. Some workers abroad felt uncertain about their next steps, while companies like Microsoft advised their employees to stay in the U.S. to avoid re-entry issues. Policy experts have mixed reactions, with some praising the move for potentially reducing wage suppression and others expressing concerns about the economic impact, particularly on start-ups. The Indian government also expressed concerns about the humanitarian consequences of the new rules.

## Trump Says Murdoch Family May Be Involved in TikTok Deal

President Trump, in a Sunday interview on Fox News, suggested that media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, CEO of Fox Corporation, might be among the investors in a deal to bring TikTok under U.S. ownership. This potential investment by Fox Corporation comes as ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese owner, seeks to separate the app's U.S. business from its Chinese parent company, a move required by a federal law passed last year due to national security concerns.

Trump also mentioned that Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, and Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Technologies, are involved in the deal. Oracle, which already provides computing resources for TikTok, is expected to take a stake in the new business, while Dell is considering investing.

The deal involves unique aspects, including discussions to pay a multibillion-dollar transaction fee to the U.S. government, a highly unusual structure. ByteDance's largest investors, including General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group, plan to stay on as investors in the new company. Private equity firm Silver Lake has also been in talks about investing.

The potential involvement of conservative-leaning Murdoch and Trump supporter Ellison raises questions about the influence new owners might have on TikTok's content and tone. The deal aims to dilute Chinese ownership in the company to less than 20% to satisfy the law.

## Trump Aligns with Authoritarian States, Free Speech in America Deteriorates

President Trump's threats to revoke broadcasting licenses of networks with late-night hosts who make jokes at his expense have pushed the United States closer to authoritarian practices seen in countries like China, India, Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela. These countries have historically used threats, financial pressure, and shutdowns to silence comedians, broadcasters, journalists, and cartoonists. Trump's tactics, including lawsuits against media companies, cuts to public broadcasting, and threats to rescind licenses or deny mergers, align with a global pattern of suppressing free speech.

Experts note that while Trump's actions are not as severe as those in the worst authoritarian regimes, they still place the United States in awkward company. Freedom of expression is deteriorating in America and 43 other countries, according to the 2025 Democracy Report by the V-Dem Institute. This trend has been worsening for at least a decade.

Examples of authoritarian crackdowns on free expression include Iran prosecuting a female comedian for a video with explicit language, Turkey arresting cartoonists for a satirical image, and India's government employees vandalizing a comedy club over a joke about a local politician. These actions reflect a broader trend of using humor as a tool for political critique, which is often met with severe repercussions.

China, under Xi Jinping, has tightened control over media, turning news outlets, films, comedy, and social media into carefully monitored fonts of government-approved messaging. Investigative journalists have nearly vanished, and loyalists have been installed at once-independent publications. Similar patterns are seen in Hungary and Russia.

In the United States, while satire and criticism continue to flow through the media, experts see flashes of authoritarianism in Trump's actions. His threats and lawsuits against universities and newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have raised concerns about the erosion of free speech. Comparisons are drawn to leaders like Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, and Viktor Orbán in Hungary, who have used similar tactics to suppress dissent.

The article concludes by warning that the United States should be cautious about the potential consequences of such actions, as seen in the experiences of countries where free expression has been severely curtailed.
