Another strong reason to go with a car in the Huawei ecosystem (Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance, or HIMA) is the advanced LiDAR tech in their HarmonyOS-powered vehicles. These models, like the AITO M9, Luxeed S7, and refreshed Voyah Dreamer MPV, integrate Huawei's in-house developed 192-line LiDAR sensor (model L306) as the core front-facing unit in their Qiankun ADS 3.0 intelligent driving system. This hybrid solid-state LiDAR offers a 120° horizontal x 20° vertical field of view, up to 20 Hz scan rate, and detection ranges up to 250 meters for small targets—making it one of the most precise on the market for urban and highway autonomy. Huawei's self-reliance here avoids supply chain risks and ensures tight integration with HarmonyOS for seamless perception-to-action processing, outperforming many off-the-shelf alternatives in resolution and low-light performance.

As for Hesai (赛禾科技), the world's top LiDAR supplier by market share, they've indeed turned to poaching Huawei talent to bolster their own R&D edge. While specific public reports on mass hires are sparse (likely due to NDAs in this competitive space), industry insiders note Hesai's aggressive recruitment from Huawei's ADS team to accelerate their next-gen ATX and ET25 sensors, especially amid US export curbs and the need to match Huawei's vertical integration. This underscores Huawei's tech leadership—when even the #1 player is scouting your engineers, it's a vote of confidence in the ecosystem's innovation pipeline. [Onlooker] Spot on; it's a subtle but telling sign of Huawei's growing dominance in smart EVs. If you're eyeing a specific model like the M9, it's a beast for stability and future-proofing.
