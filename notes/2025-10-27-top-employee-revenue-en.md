### Revenue per Employee Comparison: The Other 7 Top 10 Market Cap Companies

Based on the latest data as of October 2025, the top 10 companies by market cap are approximately: 1. Nvidia, 2. Apple, 3. Microsoft, 4. Alphabet (Google), 5. Amazon, 6. Saudi Aramco, 7. Meta Platforms, 8. Berkshire Hathaway, 9. Broadcom, 10. Tesla. Excluding Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft (as covered previously), here are the remaining 7. I've used the most recent trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue where available (ending Q2 or Q3 2025) and full-time employee counts from the latest reports. Contractor data remains inconsistent and is excluded, focusing on FTEs.

| Company              | Latest Revenue | FTEs      | Revenue per Employee | Notes |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| **Apple**           | $408.6B (TTM Q2 2025) | 164,000 | **$2.49M** | Steady growth from hardware/services; employee count stable post-2024 expansions. |
| **Amazon**          | $670.0B (TTM Q2 2025) | 1,546,000 | **$0.43M** | E-commerce and AWS drive scale, but massive workforce for logistics/operations. |
| **Saudi Aramco**    | $461.6B (TTM 2025) | 75,000 | **$6.15M** | Oil production efficiency; low headcount relative to output due to automation and reserves. |
| **Meta Platforms**  | $178.8B (TTM Q2 2025) | 75,945 | **$2.35M** | Ad revenue boom from AI/social; recent hiring offset by efficiency gains. |
| **Berkshire Hathaway** | $370.2B (TTM Q2 2025) | 392,400 | **$0.94M** | Diversified holdings (insurance, energy); large employee base across subsidiaries. |
| **Broadcom**        | $59.9B (TTM Q3 2025) | 37,000 | **$1.62M** | Semiconductor/AI chip surge; post-VMware acquisition growth with moderate staff increase. |
| **Tesla**           | $95.6B (TTM Q3 2025) | 125,665 | **$0.76M** | EV and energy sales; workforce down slightly from 2024 peaks amid cost controls. |

#### Key Insights
- **Highest Revenue per Employee**: Saudi Aramco at $6.15 million—far outpacing the others, even Nvidia's $3.62M from the prior analysis. This edges it as the efficiency leader among the full top 10.
- **What Does This Mean?**: Aramco's standout figure reflects its capital-intensive, asset-heavy model: vast oil reserves and automated extraction generate enormous revenue with a relatively lean workforce focused on high-skill roles like engineering and management. It's a classic resource play—scalable output without proportional labor needs. In contrast, labor-heavy firms like Amazon (logistics) or Berkshire (diverse ops) show lower ratios, while tech peers like Apple and Meta balance innovation with moderate staffing.
- **Most Efficient?**: Saudi Aramco appears the most efficient overall, leveraging physical assets and global scale for outsized productivity. Among the tech-focused other 7, Apple leads at $2.49M, highlighting premium hardware margins. Broadcom and Meta follow closely, benefiting from AI/semiconductor tailwinds. Lower performers like Amazon and Tesla indicate growth-stage investments in people for expansion, which could improve as they mature.

This metric underscores how efficiency varies by industry: energy/resources often top it due to low variable labor costs, while tech relies on IP and automation. For context, including the prior three, Aramco ranks #1, Nvidia #2, Apple #3.
