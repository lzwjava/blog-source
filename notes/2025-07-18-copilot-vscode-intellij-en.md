Here’s a more readable comparison (no bulky tables, promise) of **GitHub Copilot plugin in Visual Studio Code** versus in **IntelliJ IDEA**:

---

### Installation & Integration

* **VS Code**: Copilot is treated like a first-class extension—easy to install, often auto-installed, and ready to go after GitHub login. ([GitHub Docs][1])

* **IntelliJ IDEA (and other JetBrains IDEs)**: Copilot works via a plugin from the JetBrains Marketplace. You install, restart the IDE, then authenticate through GitHub. ([GitHub Docs][1])

---

### Performance & Responsiveness

* **VS Code**: Since Copilot runs natively as an extension, it generally feels snappier. ([Augment Code][2])

* **IntelliJ IDEA**: As a plugin layered on top of a heavier IDE, Copilot may introduce more latency—especially noticeable in large projects or complex requests (e.g., whole-function generation may take 2–5 seconds). ([Augment Code][2])

---

### Workflow & Compatibility

* **VS Code**: Copilot supports inline suggestions, full code generation, and Copilot Chat—all tightly integrated. ([GitHub Docs][3])

* **IntelliJ IDEA**: Copilot offers similar features—inline suggestions and a chat panel—though some users note limitations:

  > “\[It] can’t delete/rewrite code or jump to different locations.” ([Medium][4], [Hacker News][5])

---

### Ecosystem Fit & Feature Depth

* **VS Code**: Lightweight and versatile—great for quick setup, mixed-language projects, and those who need flexibility across multiple editors.

* **IntelliJ IDEA / JetBrains IDEs**: While Copilot brings AI to the table, JetBrains users might prefer **JetBrains AI Assistant** (their native AI tool). It offers deeper IDE integration—advanced refactorings, commit-message generation, tight synergy with JetBrains workflows, and better control over code usage/privacy. ([Engine Labs Blog][6])

---

### Pricing & Licensing

* **GitHub Copilot**: Subscription-based—individual plans start around \$10/month. Some free options for students. ([Techpoint Africa][7])

* **JetBrains AI** (for comparison): Comes bundled with JetBrains tools via All Products Pack, or available separately in Free, Pro, and Ultimate tiers (\~\$10–\$20/month), depending on the plan. ([AutoGPT][8])

---

### Summary — Which Is Better for You?

**VS Code (Copilot plugin)**

* **Pros**: Ultra-light, fast to set up, cross-editor flexibility, excellent for exploratory coding and multi-language workflows.
* **Cons**: Slightly less optimized for heavy-duty refactoring or project-wide awareness.

**IntelliJ IDEA (Copilot plugin)**

* **Pros**: Allows Copilot use within your familiar JetBrains environment.
* **Cons**: Slower, sometimes limited in editing capabilities, plugin-based architecture may feel less seamless.

**Extra thought**: If you're immersed in JetBrains IDEs and use languages like Java or Kotlin extensively, **JetBrains AI** may serve you better, with tighter integration and more advanced features—assuming you're okay with its different pricing model.
