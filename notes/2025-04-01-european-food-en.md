The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) serves as an impartial source of scientific advice to risk managers regarding the food chain. It aims to protect European consumers from food-related risks, from farm to fork, by providing the scientific basis for laws and regulations. While EFSA doesn't issue mandatory guidelines in the same way national authorities do, its main suggestions and work revolve around the following key areas:

**1. Providing Independent Scientific Advice:**

* EFSA's core function is to collect, appraise, and integrate scientific evidence to answer questions about risks associated with the food chain.
* This involves hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment, and risk characterization.
* They provide scientific opinions and advice to the European Commission, the European Parliament, and EU Member States to support risk management decisions.
* EFSA also carries out scientific work on its own initiative to examine emerging issues and new hazards.

**2. Ensuring Food Safety:**

* EFSA's work covers a wide range of topics impacting food and feed safety, including biological hazards (bacteria, viruses, parasites), chemical hazards (toxins, contaminants, pesticides, allergens), animal health and welfare, and plant protection.
* They contribute to the assessment of novel foods, food additives, and health claims.
* EFSA emphasizes the importance of proper food handling from shopping to cooking to reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses.
* They support the development of food safety best practices and provide scientific evaluations that inform authorities on how to mitigate risks.

**3. Contributing to Dietary Recommendations:**

* While national authorities in EU countries typically issue food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) for their populations, EFSA provides the scientific basis for these recommendations through Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for nutrients.
* DRVs include average requirements, population reference intakes, adequate intakes, and tolerable upper intake levels for various nutrients.
* EFSA has also published scientific opinions on the process of developing FBDGs in Europe, emphasizing that these guidelines should be country-specific and consider dietary habits and disease burdens.
* National dietary guidelines generally encourage the consumption of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, lean dairy, fish, and water, while discouraging foods high in saturated fats, sugars, and salt.

**4. Promoting Transparency and Cooperation:**

* EFSA is committed to openness and transparency in all its work, including the data and studies it relies upon for its assessments.
* They cooperate intensively with Member States' risk assessment organizations through various networks and forums to promote the coherence of EU scientific advice.
* EFSA engages with stakeholders and the public to ensure its work is scrutinized and to foster open dialogue.

**In summary, EFSA's main suggestion is to base food safety and dietary recommendations on the best available science. They provide independent scientific assessments and advice to support policymakers in creating regulations and guidelines that protect consumer health and ensure a safe and sustainable food chain in Europe.**

While the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) does not issue specific food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) that are directly applicable to consumers across Europe, it plays a crucial role in shaping national dietary recommendations. EFSA's main contribution in this area is the establishment of **Dietary Reference Values (DRVs)** for essential nutrients. These DRVs serve as the scientific foundation upon which national authorities in EU Member States develop their own country-specific FBDGs.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of EFSA's role and the nature of dietary recommendations in the EU:

**1. Dietary Reference Values (DRVs): The Scientific Basis**

* **Umbrella Term:** DRVs is an overarching term encompassing a set of nutrient reference values. These include:
    * **Average Requirement (AR):** The level of a nutrient intake estimated to meet the physiological needs of half of the healthy individuals in a population group.
    * **Population Reference Intake (PRI):** The level of nutrient intake that is adequate for virtually all (97.5%) healthy individuals in a population group. It is usually calculated from the AR, considering the distribution of requirements within the population.
    * **Adequate Intake (AI):** Used when there is insufficient data to calculate an AR. The AI is the average observed or experimentally determined nutrient intake by a group of healthy people assumed to be adequate.
    * **Reference Intake (RI) ranges for macronutrients:** Acceptable ranges of intake for carbohydrates, fats, and protein, expressed as a percentage of total energy intake, that are considered adequate and may help prevent chronic diseases.
    * **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** The maximum daily intake of a nutrient that is unlikely to cause adverse health effects in almost all individuals in a population group over a lifetime.
* **Nutrient Coverage:** EFSA's Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) has established DRVs for various nutrients, including:
    * **Macronutrients:** Carbohydrates (including dietary fiber), fats (including saturated, polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated fatty acids), protein, and water.
    * **Micronutrients:** Vitamins (A, D, E, K, C, B vitamins) and minerals (calcium, iron, zinc, iodine, potassium, etc.).
* **Population Group Specificity:** DRVs are often set for different life stages (infants, children, adolescents, adults, elderly) and physiological conditions (pregnancy, lactation) to account for varying nutritional needs.
* **Scientific Opinions:** EFSA publishes detailed scientific opinions for each nutrient, outlining the evidence considered and the rationale behind the established DRVs. These opinions are publicly available.

**2. Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs) at the National Level**

* **Translation of DRVs:** National health authorities within EU Member States use EFSA's DRVs as a primary scientific reference point to develop their own FBDGs.
* **Country-Specific Considerations:** FBDGs take into account national dietary habits, food availability, cultural norms, and public health priorities, which can vary significantly across Europe.
* **Practical Advice:** FBDGs translate the numerical nutrient targets (DRVs) into practical, food-based advice for the general population. This often includes:
    * Recommendations on the types and amounts of different food groups to consume (e.g., fruits, vegetables, grains, protein sources, dairy).
    * Guidance on portion sizes.
    * Advice on limiting the intake of certain nutrients or foods (e.g., saturated fats, added sugars, salt).
    * Tips for healthy food preparation and eating habits.
* **Examples of General Trends in National FBDGs (informed by EFSA's DRVs):**
    * **Emphasis on fruits and vegetables:** Encouraging the consumption of a variety of fruits and vegetables daily (often with specific recommendations like "at least 5 portions a day").
    * **Whole grains over refined grains:** Recommending whole grain bread, pasta, and cereals as sources of fiber and other nutrients.
    * **Lean protein sources:** Suggesting the inclusion of fish, poultry, legumes, and lean meats.
    * **Fat-reduced dairy:** Often recommending unsweetened, fat-reduced milk and dairy products.
    * **Healthy fats:** Encouraging the use of vegetable oils rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (e.g., olive oil, rapeseed oil) and limiting saturated and trans fats.
    * **Hydration:** Recommending adequate water intake.
    * **Moderation of less healthy components:** Advising to limit the consumption of foods high in saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
* **Accessibility:** National FBDGs are typically communicated to the public through various channels, including websites, educational materials, and public health campaigns.

**In essence, EFSA provides the "what" (the scientifically recommended intake levels of nutrients), and national authorities translate this into the "how" (practical advice on which foods to eat to meet those levels) within their specific cultural and dietary contexts.**

Therefore, to find the specific dietary recommendations relevant to you, it's best to consult the official food-based dietary guidelines issued by the national health authority in your country or region. These guidelines will be based on the scientific advice provided by EFSA, tailored to the local context.
