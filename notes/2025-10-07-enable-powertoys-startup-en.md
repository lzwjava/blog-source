To enable PowerToys to automatically run at startup in Windows 11, follow these steps within the PowerToys app itself (this is the simplest and most direct method):

1. Open the PowerToys application (search for it in the Start menu if needed).
2. Click the **Settings** icon (gear symbol) in the top-right corner to open PowerToys Settings.
3. In the left sidebar, select **General**.
4. Under the "Appearance & behavior settings" section, toggle on **Run at startup**.

Once enabled, PowerToys will launch automatically every time you sign in to Windows. You can verify it's active by going to **Settings > Apps > Startup** in Windows and checking that PowerToys appears there with the toggle enabled.

If you encounter issues, ensure PowerToys is updated via the Microsoft Store or its installer.
