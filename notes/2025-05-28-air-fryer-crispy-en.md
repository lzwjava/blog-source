Yes, you can absolutely cook potatoes in an air fryer to make them crispy, whether you want them lightly crispy, moderately crispy, or very crispy! The air fryer’s hot air circulation is perfect for achieving that crispy texture without deep frying. Here’s a quick guide to get the desired crispiness using an air fryer like the Midea MF-KZE5004 (5L capacity):

### Tips for Cooking Crispy Potatoes in an Air Fryer

1. **Preparation**:
   - **Choose the right potato**: Russet or Yukon Gold potatoes are great for crispy results due to their starch content.
   - **Cut evenly**: Cut into fries, wedges, or cubes (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick for fries) for even cooking.
   - **Soak (optional)**: Soak cut potatoes in cold water for 20-30 minutes to remove excess starch, which helps with crispiness. Pat dry thoroughly with a towel.
   - **Season**: Toss with 1-2 tsp of oil (e.g., olive or vegetable oil), salt, and optional spices (paprika, garlic powder, etc.).

2. **Cooking for Different Crispiness Levels**:
   - **Lightly Crispy**:
     - **Temperature**: 180°C (360°F).
     - **Time**: 15-20 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through.
     - **Result**: Golden exterior with a softer interior.
   - **Moderately Crispy**:
     - **Temperature**: 190°C (375°F).
     - **Time**: 20-25 minutes, shaking every 5-7 minutes.
     - **Result**: Crisp outside with a fluffy interior, similar to classic fries.
     - **Very Crispy**:
     - **Temperature**: 200°C (400°F).
     - **Time**: 25-30 minutes, shaking frequently (every 5 minutes).
     - **Result**: Extra crunchy exterior, almost like fried chips. For even crispier results, lightly spray with oil halfway through cooking.

3. **Air Fryer Tips**:
   - **Don’t overcrowd**: Place potatoes in a single layer in the basket (cook in batches if needed) to ensure even air circulation.
   - **Shake or toss**: Flip or shake the basket every 5-7 minutes to prevent sticking and promote even browning.
   - **Check doneness**: Test with a fork or taste to ensure the texture is to your liking.

4. **Optional for Extra Crispiness**:
   - Add a pinch of cornstarch or baking powder to the oil-seasoning mix for an extra crunchy coating.
   - Cook at a slightly lower temperature (e.g., 170°C/340°F) for the first half, then increase to 200°C/400°F for the last 5-10 minutes to crisp up.

### Notes:
- Cooking times may vary slightly depending on your air fryer’s wattage and the size of potato pieces. The Midea MF-KZE5004 has a 5L capacity, so it can handle a decent batch (about 500-700g of potatoes) without overcrowding.
- Always preheat the air fryer for 3-5 minutes for best results.
- If you’re unsure about settings, start with 190°C for 20 minutes and adjust time or temperature based on the texture.
