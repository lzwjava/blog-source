### **Neta Auto's "Magic Carpet Cabin": Purpose and Features**

Neta Auto's "Magic Carpet Cabin" is the core highlight of its intelligent cockpit system. It focuses on delivering superior comfort, intelligence, and an immersive experience by integrating multiple technologies to optimize the ride quality. Its key functions and purposes are as follows:

---

### **1. Intelligent Air Suspension (Available on select models)**
- **Adaptive Adjustment**: Uses sensors to monitor road conditions (e.g., bumps, curves) in real-time and automatically adjusts the suspension's damping and height. This significantly improves ride smoothness and reduces bumpiness, creating a "magic carpet"-like floating sensation.
- **Multi-Mode Driving**: Supports Comfort, Sport, and other driving modes to adapt to different road conditions or user preferences.

---

### **2. Intelligent Seat System**
- **Multi-Dimensional Adjustment**: Seats are equipped with ventilation, heating, massage, and memory functions. Some models may feature zero-gravity seats to reduce fatigue on long journeys.
- **Scenario Integration**: Works in unison with the AC and audio system. For example, if driver fatigue is detected, it might automatically adjust the seat posture and play relaxing music.

---

### **3. Immersive Audio-Visual Entertainment**
- **Large Screen & HD Interaction**: Features large central touchscreens (e.g., 17.6-inch or dual screens), powered by high-performance chips (like the Qualcomm Snapdragon), supporting 4K resolution, voice control, and smooth operation of entertainment apps.
- **Surround Sound System**: High-fidelity speaker systems (e.g., 21 speakers in the Neta S) provide a theater-like audio experience.

---

### **4. Intelligent Climate Control**
- **Air Purification**: Includes PM2.5 filtration and a negative ion generator to maintain clean and fresh cabin air.
- **Fragrance System**: Available on some models, offering multiple scent modes to enhance the cabin ambiance.

---

### **5. Personalized Scenario Modes**
- **One-Touch Scenarios**: Features pre-set modes like "Nap Mode," which automatically reclines the seat and dims the lights, or "Camping Mode," which maintains a constant temperature and power supply for vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality.

---

### **6. Synergy with Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)**
- Works with Neta's NETA Pilot ADAS. Using data from radars and cameras to anticipate road conditions, it can proactively adjust the suspension or seat posture to enhance both comfort and safety.

---

### **Summary: Who is it for?**
- **Families**: Prioritize passenger comfort, especially for children and the elderly.
- **Tech Enthusiasts**: Appreciate smart interaction and scenario-based experiences.
- **Long-Distance Drivers**: Benefit from features like seat massage and air suspension to reduce fatigue.

**Note**: Specific features may vary depending on the model and trim (e.g., Neta S, Neta GT). It's always best to check the official specifications or experience them with a test drive.
