title: 'Herbert Dingle: A Physicist at Odds with Relativity and the Scientific Establishment'
translated: false
type: note
---

Herbert Dingle (1890-1978) was a distinguished English physicist and philosopher of science, known for his work in spectroscopy, his presidency of the Royal Astronomical Society, and his later, highly public, opposition to Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity. A staunch advocate for empiricism and a critic of what he saw as excessive mathematical abstraction in physics, Dingle's controversial stance on relativity and his subsequent experiences with the scientific community were documented in his book, *Science at the Crossroads*.

Dingle initially worked in the field of spectroscopy, making notable contributions and publishing influential books on the subject. He held academic positions at Imperial College and later became Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at University College London. Throughout his career, Dingle emphasized the importance of observational data and logical consistency in scientific theories.

### Science at the Crossroads: A Challenge to Relativity and Scientific Orthodoxy

Published in 1972, *Science at the Crossroads* serves as both a summation of Dingle's scientific and philosophical views and a detailed account of his protracted battle with the scientific establishment over the validity of special relativity. The core of Dingle's argument against special relativity, and a central theme of the book, revolved around the theory's prediction of time dilation, particularly as illustrated by the "twin paradox."

Dingle contended that special relativity led to a logical contradiction. The theory states that if two clocks are in relative motion, each clock will appear to the observer in the other frame of reference to be running slower. Dingle argued that this reciprocal time dilation was logically impossible. He posed a fundamental question: if clock A is moving relative to clock B, and clock B is moving relative to clock A, which clock actually runs slower? According to Dingle, special relativity, based solely on relative motion between inertial frames, could not answer this question without inherent contradiction, as it would require both clocks to be simultaneously slower than the other, which he viewed as absurd.

His book details his attempts to engage with the scientific community on this point, presenting his arguments to prominent physicists and submitting papers to scientific journals. Dingle claimed that his logical challenge was not adequately addressed or refuted by the scientific establishment. Instead, he felt his arguments were ignored, evaded, or suppressed, leading him to believe that science had reached a "crossroads" where adherence to established dogma and mathematical formalism had superseded empirical evidence and logical rigor.

Beyond his specific criticism of relativity, *Science at the Crossroads* also reflects Dingle's broader philosophical concerns about the direction of modern physics. He argued against what he saw as an over-reliance on abstract mathematical constructs that lacked direct empirical grounding. Dingle believed that theoretical physics was becoming increasingly detached from the observable world, prioritizing mathematical elegance and internal consistency over experimental verification.

In essence, *Science at the Crossroads* is Dingle's impassioned plea for a return to what he considered the true principles of the scientific method: theories firmly based on experience and free from logical inconsistencies. The book serves as a historical document of a significant scientific controversy and offers a critical perspective on the nature of scientific progress and the dynamics of the scientific community when faced with fundamental challenges to prevailing paradigms. While Dingle's criticisms of special relativity were largely rejected by the mainstream physics community, his book remains a testament to his unwavering commitment to his principles and his concerns about the philosophical underpinnings of modern science.
