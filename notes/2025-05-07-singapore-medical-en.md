The Singapore Medical Council (SMC), a statutory board under the Ministry of Health in Singapore, recognizes specific medical schools in China. Graduates from these schools may be considered for medical registration in Singapore, subject to fulfilling all criteria and conditions set by the SMC.

As of the information available from the Singapore Medical Council's list of registrable basic medical qualifications, here are four recognized medical schools in China:

1.  **Peking University Health Science Centre (PUHSC)**
    * Recognized qualifications: Master of Medicine, Doctor of Medicine
    * Year of addition to the list: 2009
2.  **Fudan University, Shanghai Medical College**
    * Recognized qualification: Doctor of Medicine
    * Year of addition to the list: 2009
3.  **Tsinghua University, Peking Union Medical College (PUMC)**
    * Recognized qualification: Doctor of Medicine
    * Year of addition to the list: 2009
4.  **Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine**
    * Recognized qualification: Doctor of Medicine
    * Year of addition to the list: 2009

It's important to note that the Singapore Medical Council also lists other recognized medical schools in China. These include:

* **Sun Yat-Sen College of Medical Science (Guangdong), Sun Yat-Sen University** (Doctor of Medicine, added 2009)
* **Zhejiang University School of Medicine** (Master of Medicine, Doctor of Medicine, added 2009)
* **School of Medicine, Wuhan University** (Master of Medicine, Doctor of Medicine, added 2009)
* **The West China College of Medicine, Sichuan University** (Master of Medicine, Doctor of Medicine, added 2009)

**Important Considerations:**

* The Singapore Medical Council specifies that for medical schools in China, it generally recognizes the direct 7-year Master of Medicine and 8-year Doctor of Medicine programs for the purpose of medical registration.
* Recognition is often tied to specific programs and campuses that were evaluated at the time of inclusion on the list. Any significant changes to the medical curriculum or new campuses may not be automatically recognized.
* Graduates from recognized overseas medical schools must typically pass the relevant national licensing examinations in the country of graduation to be considered for registration in Singapore.
* The list of recognized overseas medical schools is subject to review and changes by the Singapore Medical Council. It is crucial for prospective students or applicants to refer to the latest list published on the official Singapore Medical Council or Ministry of Health websites.
* Meeting the qualification criteria from a recognized school is just one of the requirements for medical registration in Singapore. Every application is considered based on its own merits.
