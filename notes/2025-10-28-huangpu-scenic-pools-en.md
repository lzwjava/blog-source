### Recommended Hotels in Guangzhou's Huangpu District with Scenic Pools Near Shuixi Road

Based on your preferences for scenic swimming pools (with relaxing water features like streams or bubbling), easy onsite or nearby parking, and proximity to Shuixi Road in Huangpu (similar to the Atour Hotel area in Science City), here are the top matches. These are within 1-10 km of Shuixi Road, focusing on serene, nature-inspired settings. I've prioritized hotels with garden/lake views and water sounds for a calming vibe.

| Hotel Name | Address | Pool Highlights | Parking | Distance to Shuixi Road | Why It Fits |
|------------|---------|-----------------|---------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **DoubleTree by Hilton Guangzhou - Science City** | 18 Shuixi Road, Huangpu District | Outdoor rooftop pool overlooking a private lush garden; serene greenery surrounds it for a peaceful swim with potential fountain-like water ambiance. | Free onsite parking available. | Directly on Shuixi Road (0 km). | Prime location matching your example; scenic garden views and easy access for parking/driving. |
| **Hilton Guangzhou Science City** | 28 Ningcai Road, Huangpu District | Indoor/outdoor hot spring pools with jacuzzis (bubbling water sounds); spa-like setting with relaxing thermal features. | Onsite parking at ¥32/day; large lot for easy access. | ~2 km (5-min drive). | Close to Science City hub; hot springs add soothing water sounds and scenic relaxation. |
| **Narada Guangzhou Huangpu** | 129 Wenjian Road, Huangpu District | Lan Power indoor pool plus outdoor "stream stone pool" with flowing water sounds; lakeside views and 6,000 sqm royal lawn for a tranquil, nature-immersed scene. | Free onsite parking. | ~8-10 km (15-20 min drive) to Shuikou Reservoir area. | Ultimate water sound experience with streams; surrounded by mountains/water for scenic calm, still accessible from Huangpu. |

These options emphasize relaxation and convenience—DoubleTree for spot-on location, Hilton for spa vibes, and Narada for immersive nature sounds. Prices vary by season (check current rates), but all are 4-5 star. If you need bookings or more details, let me know!
