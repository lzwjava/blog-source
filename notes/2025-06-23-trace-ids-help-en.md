Even for a single monolithic Spring application, using trace IDs can be highly beneficial, although not strictly essential in the same way they are for distributed microservice architectures.

Here's why you might want to use trace IDs in a monolithic Spring application:

* **Improved Log Correlation:** In a monolithic application, a single user request can involve multiple methods, classes, or even different threads. A trace ID allows you to uniquely identify all log entries related to a specific request, making it much easier to follow its complete flow through your application. This is particularly helpful for debugging complex issues or understanding the sequence of operations.
* **Easier Debugging and Troubleshooting:** When an issue arises, you can quickly filter and analyze logs based on a trace ID to pinpoint where and when a problem occurred within the application's execution path. This significantly reduces the time spent on troubleshooting.
* **Enhanced Observability:** Trace IDs provide a structured way to gain insight into how individual requests are processed, even within a single application. This can help in understanding performance bottlenecks or unexpected behavior.
* **Spring Boot Integration:** Spring Boot, especially with Micrometer Tracing (and previously Spring Cloud Sleuth), offers built-in support for injecting trace IDs and span IDs into your logs by default. This makes implementation relatively straightforward.

While traditional monolithic applications might rely on thread IDs for log correlation, trace IDs offer a more robust and organized approach, especially as the application grows in complexity or incorporates asynchronous operations. Therefore, it is generally recommended to use them for better maintainability and operational insights.
