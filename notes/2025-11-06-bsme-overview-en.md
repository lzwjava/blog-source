The Business Support, Management & Efficiency (BSME) department at Standard Chartered Bank is a function within the bank's Group Operations division. It focuses on driving operational excellence, process optimization, and cost efficiencies across the organization's global business lines. Key responsibilities include:

- **Process Improvement and Automation**: Identifying bottlenecks in business workflows and implementing digital tools, lean methodologies, and automation to streamline operations.
- **Management Support**: Providing advisory services to senior leaders on resource allocation, performance metrics, and strategic initiatives to enhance decision-making.
- **Efficiency and Cost Management**: Conducting audits, benchmarking exercises, and change management programs to reduce operational costs while maintaining compliance and risk standards.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Partnering with front-office (e.g., retail banking, corporate finance) and back-office teams to support scalability, especially in emerging markets where Standard Chartered has a strong presence.

This department plays a critical role in the bank's broader transformation agenda, aligning with initiatives like SC Ventures (their innovation arm) to foster a more agile and efficient organization. It reports into senior operations leadership and often recruits professionals with backgrounds in consulting, operations, or Six Sigma/Lean expertise.
