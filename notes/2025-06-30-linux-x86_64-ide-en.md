Based on the output of `uname -a`, your computer is running a Linux system with an `x86_64` architecture. Therefore, you should download the **Linux** version of the JetBrains Rust IDE (CLion with Rust plugin or IntelliJ IDEA with Rust plugin) from the provided link, not the **Linux ARM64** version, as ARM64 is for ARM-based processors, not x86_64.

Download the **Linux** version from: https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/download/?section=linux
