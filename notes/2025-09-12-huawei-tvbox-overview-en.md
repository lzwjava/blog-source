Yes, **Huawei does offer some international (foreign) versions of its TV boxes**, but availability depends on the region and model. Here’s what you need to know:

### **1. Huawei TV Box (International Versions)**
- **Huawei Vision Box (or "Huawei Box")** – Some models like the **Huawei Vision Box 3** or **Huawei Box N** were released in **global markets** (e.g., Europe, Middle East, Asia).
- **Language Support**: These usually support **English + local languages** (e.g., Spanish, French, Arabic, etc.).
- **Google Services**: Unlike Chinese versions, **some international models may include Google Play Store** (but not all—check before buying).
- **YouTube Support**: If it has **Google Play**, YouTube should work. If not, you may need to **sideload** it.

### **2. Where to Buy?**
- **Official Huawei Stores** (e.g., [Huawei Global](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/)) – Check if they ship to your country.
- **Amazon (International Sellers)** – Search for **"Huawei TV Box global version"**.
- **AliExpress / Gearbest** – Some sellers offer international versions (but verify compatibility).
- **Local Electronics Stores** (e.g., in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, or Europe).

### **3. Alternatives (If Huawei Isn’t Available)**
If you can’t find a Huawei box, consider:
- **NVIDIA Shield TV** (Best for YouTube, Netflix, gaming)
- **Xiaomi Mi Box S** (Global version, supports Google Play & YouTube)
- **Amazon Fire TV Stick** (Works well with YouTube, but no Google Play)
- **Android TV Boxes (e.g., Mecool, Beelink)** – Many support English & YouTube.

### **4. Important Notes Before Buying**
✅ **Check if it has Google Play** (for YouTube, Netflix, etc.).
✅ **Confirm language support** (some may default to Chinese).
✅ **Avoid Chinese-only models** (e.g., "Huawei Honor Box" – may lack Google services).
✅ **Look for "Global ROM"** in product descriptions.

### **Final Verdict**
Yes, **Huawei has released international TV boxes**, but they’re not as widely available as Xiaomi or NVIDIA. If you really want one, check **Amazon, AliExpress, or Huawei’s official global store**. Otherwise, a **Xiaomi Mi Box S or NVIDIA Shield** might be a better English-friendly alternative.
