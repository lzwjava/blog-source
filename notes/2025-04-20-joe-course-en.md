The course taught by instructor Joe Gryniuk at Lake Washington Technical College in Kirkland, Washington, is about the **Fundamentals of Electricity**. It covers the essential principles and concepts needed to understand how electricity works, particularly focusing on the core properties that drive the entire electrical and electronics industry: **voltage, current, resistance, and power**. These four properties are described as the "big four," fundamental to making any electrical or electronic device function, from cell phones to car computers and satellite TV[^1].

The course begins with basic concepts such as matter, elements, molecules, and atomic structure, which are foundational to understanding electrical behavior. It then progresses to more specific topics like DC circuits (direct current), the difference between direct and alternating current, and how these principles apply in practical electronics[^1].

Additionally, the course includes detailed explanations of electronic components such as diodes, including their construction, operation (forward and reverse bias), and practical characteristics like barrier voltage and depletion regions. This component-level understanding is crucial for grasping how electronic devices control current flow and function in circuits[^2].

The teaching approach emphasizes following a syllabus aligned with industry needs, ensuring students learn relevant skills to succeed in the electrical and electronics field. The program guarantees that graduates meet industry standards, with a promise to re-educate any student if their employer finds their knowledge insufficient[^1].

In summary, this course provides a comprehensive introduction to electricity and electronics, covering theory, practical components, and real-world applications to prepare students for careers in the electrical industry.

**Key topics covered:**

- Basic atomic and molecular structure related to electricity
- The four fundamental electrical properties: voltage, current, resistance, power
- DC circuits and the difference between DC and AC
- Electronic components like diodes, including their operation and testing
- Practical application aligned with industry standards and requirements

This course is ideal for anyone seeking a solid foundation in electrical fundamentals and electronics principles[^1][^2].
