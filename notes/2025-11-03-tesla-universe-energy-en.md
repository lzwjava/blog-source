Nikola Tesla is often attributed with the quote: "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration."

This phrasing captures the idea of understanding three key elements—energy, frequency, and vibration—to unlock deeper insights into the world. However, while it's widely circulated and fits Tesla's known interests in electricity, electromagnetism, and resonance, there's no definitive primary source (like a verified writing or interview) confirming he said it exactly this way. It may stem from interpretations of his lectures or notes.
