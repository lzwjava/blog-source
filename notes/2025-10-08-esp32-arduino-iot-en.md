The ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power microcontroller developed by Espressif Systems, featuring built-in Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth connectivity. It's essentially a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that's widely used for IoT (Internet of Things) projects, sensors, and wireless applications due to its versatility and performance.

In the context of Arduino, the ESP32 isn't "inside" Arduino but is fully compatible with the Arduino ecosystem. You can program ESP32 boards (like the popular NodeMCU or the official Arduino Nano ESP32) using the free Arduino IDE software. This involves installing the ESP32 board package via the IDE's Board Manager, then writing sketches in C/C++ (just like with traditional Arduino boards like the Uno). The ESP32 offers advantages over basic Arduinos, such as faster processing (dual-core up to 240 MHz), more GPIO pins, and wireless features, making it ideal for connected projects without needing extra shields.

If you're new to it, start by downloading the Arduino IDE and searching for "ESP32 board package" in the Tools > Board > Boards Manager menu.
