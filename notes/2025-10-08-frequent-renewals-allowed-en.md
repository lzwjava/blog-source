Yes, for the 1-year single-entry endorsement (1年一次签注), mainland China residents can apply multiple times without any frequency limits or quantity restrictions, as long as they hold a valid Home Return Permit (往来港澳通行证). Once the endorsement expires after 1 year or the single entry is used, you can simply reapply at a police station self-service machine (in places like Guangzhou) or exit-entry office—it's treated like any other renewal or new application, with no waiting period required.

This applies to eligible residents in pilot cities like Guangzhou, where the process is quick and straightforward.
