I am unable to provide a definitive list of the top 100 downloaded Maven Java dependencies for 2025, as comprehensive, up-to-date download statistics are not publicly available from Maven Central or other repositories. Download counts are not consistently exposed across repositories like Maven Central, and metrics like "usages" (how often a library is referenced by other projects in Maven Central) do not fully reflect download popularity, especially for enterprise or non-open-source projects.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72383687/what-are-the-possible-metrics-by-which-i-can-assess-whether-a-java-library-is-su)

However, I can highlight some commonly used Maven dependencies based on their popularity in open-source projects, as indicated by their frequent inclusion in pom.xml files and mentions in developer communities. Below is a curated list of widely adopted Java libraries and frameworks, often cited for their utility and prevalence in 2024–2025, based on available web sources and developer discussions. This is not a ranked top 100 but a representative sample of dependencies that are likely among the most downloaded due to their widespread use.

### Notes on Popularity and Sources
- **Why No Exact Top 100?** Maven Central does not publicly expose download counts, unlike npm for JavaScript libraries. The "usages" metric on mvnrepository.com (e.g., 4000 usages for commons-lang3 in March 2021) reflects how many Maven projects in the repository depend on a library, but this excludes private or enterprise projects, skewing the data.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72383687/what-are-the-possible-metrics-by-which-i-can-assess-whether-a-java-library-is-su)
- **Criteria for Inclusion**: The above libraries are selected based on their frequent mention in tutorials, blogs, and developer discussions (e.g., Baeldung, Stack Overflow, Maven Repository). They cover essential areas like logging, testing, JSON processing, HTTP clients, and ORM, which are critical in most Java projects.[](https://mvnrepository.com/popular)[](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/maven-dependency)[](https://www.baeldung.com/maven-unused-dependencies)
- **Dynamic Nature**: Dependency popularity shifts with trends (e.g., Spring Boot’s rise, Log4j vulnerabilities affecting adoption). For 2025, libraries supporting modern Java (e.g., Java 21) and frameworks like Spring Boot are likely dominant.[](https://mvnrepository.com/popular)[](https://www.baeldung.com/maven-unused-dependencies)

### How to Explore Further
To get a sense of popular dependencies for your specific needs:
1. **Check Maven Central**: Visit mvnrepository.com and browse the "Top Projects" section for libraries with high usage counts.[](https://mvnrepository.com/popular)
2. **Use Maven Dependency Plugin**: Run `mvn dependency:tree` to analyze dependencies in your project, or `mvn dependency:analyze` to identify used/unused dependencies.[](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/usage.html)[](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-apache-maven/9781783983865/ch09s20.html)
3. **Community Insights**: Check developer forums like Reddit or Stack Overflow for trending libraries. For example, a 2016 Reddit post linked to javalibs.com for dependency charts, though it’s outdated.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/518go7/most_popular_java_libraries_and_other_stats_from/)
4. **Security Considerations**: Use the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies, as libraries like Log4j have had issues in the past.[](https://www.squins.com/knowledge/managing-maven-dependencies/)

If you need a specific subset (e.g., top libraries for testing or web development) or want me to generate a chart visualizing dependency categories, let me know! For pricing or subscription details related to Maven or xAI products, I can redirect you to appropriate resources (e.g., https://x.ai/api for xAI’s API service).

### Notes
- **Selection Criteria**: These dependencies were chosen based on their frequent use in tutorials (e.g., Baeldung), Maven Repository’s “usages” metric, and their relevance in modern Java ecosystems (e.g., Spring Boot, JPA, testing). They cover critical areas like web, database, security, and build tools.
- **Versioning**: Specific versions are omitted as they vary by project and Java version (e.g., Java 21 for 2025 projects). Check mvnrepository.com for the latest versions.
- **Limitations**: Without direct download stats, this list relies on indirect indicators like project adoption and community mentions. Enterprise or private repo usage may differ.
- **Further Exploration**: Use `mvn dependency:tree` to analyze your project’s dependencies or browse Maven Central for trending libraries. For security, scan with OWASP Dependency-Check.
