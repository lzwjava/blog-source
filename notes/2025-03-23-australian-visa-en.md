To obtain an Australian travel visa as a Chinese citizen in Guangzhou, here's what you'll need to do:

1. Determine the right visa type - typically the Visitor visa (subclass 600) for tourism or business visits

2. Apply online through the Australian Department of Home Affairs website or through the Australian Visa Application Centre (AVAC) in Guangzhou:
   - Address: 5F, Yuexiu NEO Tower B, 238 Zhongshan Road, Yuexiu District

3. Prepare these documents:
   - Valid passport
   - Completed application form
   - Recent passport-sized photographs
   - Proof of sufficient funds (bank statements)
   - Travel itinerary
   - Accommodation details
   - Letter explaining your purpose of visit
   - Evidence of ties to China (employment letter, property ownership)

4. Pay the visa application fee (around 1,000 RMB)

5. Attend a biometrics appointment if required

6. Wait for processing - typically 15-30 days, though processing times can vary

It's advisable to apply at least 6-8 weeks before your planned travel date. Consider using a registered migration agent if you need assistance with the application process.
