### How to Play Delta Force on iOS

Delta Force is a free-to-play AAA shooter game (specifically the mobile version, Delta Force Mobile) available on iOS. It features intense PvP warfare and extraction modes. Here's a step-by-step guide to get started.

#### Step 1: Check System Requirements
Ensure your device meets the minimum specs to run smoothly:
- **iOS Version**: iOS 12 or later
- **Device**: iPhone 7 or newer, iPad (6th generation) or newer, with at least 2GB RAM and an A10 processor or better
- **Recommended**: iOS 14 or later, iPhone 11 or newer (A13 processor, 4GB RAM) for optimal performance like 120fps graphics

If your device is older, the game may not run well or at all.

#### Step 2: Download the Game
1. Open the **App Store** on your iPhone or iPad.
2. Search for **"Delta Force"** (developed by TiMi Studio Group).
3. Tap **Get** to download (it's free, but includes in-app purchases for cosmetics and boosts—no pay-to-win elements in core gameplay).
4. Wait for the download to complete (file size is around 2-3GB, so use Wi-Fi).

#### Step 3: Launch and Set Up
1. Open the **Delta Force** app from your home screen.
2. Sign in with a Tencent account (or create one—it's quick via email, phone, or social login like Apple ID). This enables cross-platform progress syncing.
3. Grant permissions for storage, network access, and notifications.
4. The game will auto-download any additional updates or assets (this may take a few minutes on first launch).

#### Step 4: Learn the Basics and Start Playing
- **In-Game Tutorial**: On first launch, follow the built-in tutorial. It covers movement, shooting, and basic objectives in a safe training mode.
- **Controls** (touch-based, customizable):
  - Left thumbstick: Move character.
  - Right thumbstick: Look/aim.
  - Fire button: Shoot (auto or manual aim).
  - Jump/crouch/prone: Contextual buttons on screen.
  - Vehicle controls adapt for driving/flying in multi-terrain battles.
- **Game Modes**:
  - **Warfare**: 24v24 team battles across 9 maps (land, sea, air). Modes include Team Deathmatch, King of the Hill, and more. Focus on capturing points or eliminating enemies with 100+ weapons and destructible environments.
  - **Operations**: Squad-based extraction shooter (3-player teams). Loot gear, fight AI enemies/bosses, and extract rewards. No classes—pure skill-based with 10+ elite operators to choose from.
- **Tips for Beginners**:
  - Customize loadouts in the menu (weapons, attachments, vehicles).
  - Play solo or squad up via matchmaking.
  - Enable anti-cheat in settings for fair play.
  - Progress by completing daily missions for unlocks.

The game supports global servers, so expect some matchmaking wait times. If you encounter issues, check the in-game support or community forums.
