When your Google One membership expires, Google will not immediately delete your files. Here's what typically happens:

* **Downgrade to Free Storage:** Your storage will revert to the default free 15 GB that comes with a Google account.
* **Continued Access (for a while):** You will likely still be able to access and download your existing files for a limited period.
* **Over Quota Issues:** If the amount of data you have stored exceeds the free 15 GB limit, you won't be able to:
    * **Upload new files** to Google Drive or Google Photos.
    * **Create new files** in Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, and Jamboard.
    * **Send or receive emails** in Gmail if your Gmail storage is full.
    * **Sync files** between your computer and Google Drive.
* **Potential Deletion:** If you remain over your storage quota for an extended period (Google mentions 2 years in some help articles), Google may eventually delete your content across Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Photos. They will typically send you notifications to your email address before taking such action, so it's crucial to monitor your email.

**Therefore, while Google doesn't immediately delete your files when your membership expires, it's crucial to either:**

1.  **Renew your membership** to maintain the 2 TB storage.
2.  **Reduce your storage usage** to be within the free 15 GB limit by deleting unnecessary files.
3.  **Download your files** and store them elsewhere if you choose not to continue with a paid plan and your storage exceeds 15 GB.

It's best to take action promptly after your membership expires to avoid any potential issues with accessing your files or the risk of them being deleted in the long term.
