Yes, it is generally possible for international students who have obtained a Master's degree from NUS or NTU in Singapore to stay and work in the country after graduation. Here's a breakdown of the process and important considerations:

**1. Work Visa Options:**

After graduation, your student pass will expire. To work legally in Singapore, you will need to apply for a relevant work visa. The primary options for Master's degree graduates typically fall under the following categories:

* **Employment Pass (EP):** This is for foreign professionals, managers, and executives. To be eligible, you generally need a job offer in a managerial, executive, or specialized role and must meet the minimum salary requirements, which are currently **SGD 5,600 per month** (as of January 1, 2025) and increase with age. For the financial services sector, the minimum is **SGD 6,200 per month**. Employers usually sponsor this pass. Having a degree from a reputable university like NUS or NTU can be advantageous for EP applications.
* **S Pass:** This is for mid-level skilled workers. The minimum salary requirement is lower than the EP, currently at least **SGD 3,150 per month** (as of September 1, 2023), and it also considers factors like qualifications, skills, and work experience. There's a quota for S Pass holders that companies can employ.
* **Personalised Employment Pass (PEP):** This is for high-earning professionals and offers more flexibility than an EP. However, the eligibility criteria are stringent, requiring a fixed salary of at least **SGD 270,000 per calendar year** for overseas applicants. It's usually for very experienced professionals.
* **Overseas Networks & Expertise (ONE) Pass:** This pass is for top talent in various fields and does not require a prior job offer. Applicants need to demonstrate a high monthly salary (at least **SGD 30,000**) or outstanding achievements in their field.

**2. The Application Process:**

* **Job Offer:** The crucial first step is to secure a job offer from a company in Singapore. Your university's career services and various job portals can be helpful resources.
* **Employer Sponsorship:** Usually, your prospective employer will need to apply for the work pass on your behalf through the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) online portal.
* **Required Documents:** You will typically need to provide documents such as your passport, degree certificate, transcripts, employment contract, and other supporting documents as requested by MOM.
* **Processing Time:** The processing time for work pass applications can vary.
* **In-Principle Approval (IPA):** If your application is successful initially, your employer will receive an IPA letter from MOM. You will then need to enter Singapore (if you are overseas) or complete further formalities in Singapore to get the actual work pass issued.
* **Work Pass Card:** Once the process is complete, you will receive a work pass card.

**3. Important Considerations:**

* **Job Market:** While Singapore has a robust economy with opportunities in various sectors, the job market can be competitive. Computer Science graduates, in particular, often find good prospects in Singapore's growing technology industry.
* **Eligibility Criteria:** Ensure you meet the specific eligibility criteria for the work pass you are applying for. These criteria can change, so always refer to the latest information on the MOM website.
* **Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS):** For Employment Pass applications, MOM uses COMPASS, a points-based system that assesses applicants based on various individual and firm-related attributes to ensure they complement the local workforce.
* **Tuition Grant Scheme:** If you received a Tuition Grant from the Singapore government for your Master's degree, you might be obligated to work for a Singapore-registered company for a specific period (typically three years) after graduation.
* **Permanent Residency (PR):** After working in Singapore for a certain period (usually a few years) on a work pass, you may be eligible to apply for Permanent Residency. Recent policy changes have also made it potentially easier for eligible international students to apply for PR after passing certain national exams or being enrolled in integrated programs.
* **Work Pass Exemption for Students:** While holding a student pass, there are limited conditions under which you can work part-time during term or full-time during vacation. However, once you graduate, you will need a valid work pass to continue working.

**In summary, obtaining a Master's degree in Computer Science from NUS or NTU significantly enhances your prospects of finding employment in Singapore. By securing a job offer that meets the criteria for an Employment Pass or other relevant work passes, you can transition from being a student to a working professional in Singapore.** It's essential to start your job search early, understand the work visa application process, and ensure you meet all the necessary requirements.
