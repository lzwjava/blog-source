I apologize for the confusion. It seems my previous approach didn’t correctly address your request to disable error indicators (red lines) in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for a Java Spring project using Gradle, specifically for "cannot find symbol" errors. Let me provide a corrected and complete solution to hide those error indicators effectively.

Since you want to disable the red underlines in the editor, and the errors are related to Java (likely detected by the Java language server in VSCode), I’ll focus on solutions that directly control error display without relying on assumptions that may not apply. Here are the steps to achieve this:

---

### **Solution 1: Adjust Java Error Severity in Workspace Settings**
The "cannot find symbol" errors often arise from classpath issues or unresolved references, which the Java Extension Pack in VSCode highlights as red lines. You can configure the Java extension to ignore these specific errors.

1. **Open the Workspace Settings:**
   - In your project folder, navigate to the `.vscode` directory. If it doesn’t exist, create it.
   - Inside `.vscode`, open or create a file named `settings.json`.

2. **Add the Following Configuration:**
   ```json
   {
       "java.errors.incompleteClasspath.severity": "ignore"
   }
   ```
   - This setting tells the Java language server to ignore errors related to an incomplete classpath, which is a common cause of "cannot find symbol" issues in Gradle projects.

3. **Reload VSCode:**
   - Save the `settings.json` file.
   - Reload VSCode by pressing `Ctrl + R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + R` (macOS), or use the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P`) and select "Developer: Reload Window".

4. **Check the Result:**
   - After reloading, the red lines for "cannot find symbol" errors should disappear if they were due to classpath issues.

---

### **Solution 2: Globally Disable Java Diagnostics (Advanced)**
If Solution 1 doesn’t fully remove the red lines, or if the errors stem from broader Java language server diagnostics, you can disable more error checking features.

1. **Edit Workspace Settings:**
   - Open `.vscode/settings.json` as described above.

2. **Add a Broader Configuration:**
   ```json
   {
       "java.errors.incompleteClasspath.severity": "ignore",
       "java.validate.references": false
   }
   ```
   - The `"java.validate.references": false` setting may disable reference validation, potentially reducing additional "cannot find symbol" errors. Note that this setting’s availability depends on your Java extension version, so it’s experimental.

3. **Reload VSCode:**
   - Save and reload as in Solution 1.

---

### **Solution 3: Disable All Editor Diagnostics for Java Files**
If the above solutions don’t suffice, you can disable VSCode’s inline error underlines entirely for Java files, while keeping other Java features intact.

1. **Open Workspace Settings:**
   - Go to `.vscode/settings.json`.

2. **Add the Following:**
   ```json
   {
       "[java]": {
           "editor.showLinting": false,
           "editor.diagnostics": false
       }
   }
   ```
   - This targets only Java files (`[java]`) and disables linting and diagnostics, removing the red lines in the editor.

3. **Reload VSCode:**
   - Save and reload the window.

**Note:** This approach might not be available in older VSCode versions, as `"editor.diagnostics"` isn’t a standard setting. If it doesn’t work, proceed to Solution 4.

---

### **Solution 4: Disable the Java Extension for This Workspace**
For a more drastic but guaranteed way to remove all Java-related error indicators:

1. **Open the Extensions View:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + X` (macOS).

2. **Locate "Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat":**
   - This is the main extension providing Java support and error checking.

3. **Disable for Workspace:**
   - Click the gear icon next to the extension.
   - Select "Disable (Workspace)".

4. **Reload VSCode:**
   - Reload the window to apply the change.

**Trade-off:** This disables all Java features (e.g., code completion, debugging), not just error indicators. Use this only if you don’t need Java-specific support in this project.

---

### **Recommended Approach**
- **Start with Solution 1**: It’s the most precise, targeting classpath-related errors common in Gradle projects.
- **Try Solution 2 or 3 if needed**: These offer broader control over diagnostics.
- **Use Solution 4 as a last resort**: Only if you’re willing to lose all Java features.

---

### **Important Notes**
- **Hiding vs. Fixing**: These solutions hide the red lines but don’t resolve the underlying "cannot find symbol" issues. For a Gradle project, running `gradle build` or `gradle clean build` in the terminal might fix the root cause by ensuring dependencies are correctly resolved.
- **Spring-Specific Context**: Since it’s a Java Spring project, ensure your `build.gradle` file includes all necessary dependencies (e.g., `spring-boot-starter`). Unresolved symbols might persist if the build configuration is incomplete, but these solutions will still hide the indicators as requested.
- **Reverting Changes**: To undo, remove the added lines from `settings.json` or re-enable the extension.

Please try Solution 1 first and let me know if the red lines persist. I’m here to refine the answer further if needed!

It sounds like you’re still seeing red line errors in VSCode, specifically "Nullable cannot resolve to a type," even after applying some configurations. Let’s resolve this step by step in a clear and practical way.

---

### Why This Error Happens
The "Nullable cannot resolve to a type" error means that VSCode’s Java language server can’t find the `Nullable` annotation or class in your project. This could be due to:
- A missing dependency in your project (e.g., the library that provides `Nullable` isn’t included).
- An incorrect or missing import statement in your code.
- A Gradle or VSCode configuration issue that’s preventing the classpath from being set up correctly.

Since you’ve already tried some fixes, we’ll focus on verifying the essentials and then tweaking VSCode to eliminate those red lines.

---

### Step 1: Fix the Code and Dependencies
Let’s make sure your code and project setup are correct.

#### **Check Your Import Statement**
In your Java file, ensure you’re importing `Nullable` from the right package. Here are the two most common options:
- **For Spring projects**:
  ```java
  import org.springframework.lang.Nullable;
  ```
- **For general use** (e.g., JSR-305 annotations):
  ```java
  import javax.annotation.Nullable;
  ```

If you’re not sure which one you need, check your project’s framework or ask your team. If there’s no import statement at all, add the appropriate one.

#### **Add the Dependency in Gradle**
If the import is correct but the error persists, the library might not be in your project. Open your `build.gradle` file and add the necessary dependency:
- **For Spring** (if you’re using Spring Boot or Spring Framework):
  ```groovy
  implementation 'org.springframework:spring-context:5.3.10'  // Adjust version to match your project
  ```
- **For JSR-305** (a common source of `javax.annotation.Nullable`):
  ```groovy
  implementation 'com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:3.0.2'
  ```

After adding the dependency:
1. Open a terminal in VSCode.
2. Run:
   ```
   gradle clean build
   ```
   This ensures Gradle downloads the dependency and updates your project’s classpath.
3. Reload VSCode:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac).
   - Type "Developer: Reload Window" and select it.

---

### Step 2: Reduce Error Indicators in VSCode
If the red lines still appear after fixing the code and dependencies, it might be a VSCode configuration issue. Let’s adjust some settings.

#### **Ignore Classpath Errors**
Sometimes, VSCode flags errors even when the build works fine due to incomplete classpath detection. Add this to your `.vscode/settings.json` file:
1. Open the file (create it in the `.vscode` folder if it doesn’t exist).
2. Add:
   ```json
   {
       "java.errors.incompleteClasspath.severity": "ignore"
   }
   ```
3. Save the file and wait for VSCode to refresh (or reload the window again).

This tells VSCode to stop showing red lines for classpath-related issues like missing types.

#### **Disable Overly Strict Validation**
If the error still shows up, we can reduce how strictly VSCode checks references. Add this to `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
    "java.validate.references": false
}
```
**Note**: This setting is experimental and might not work in all versions of the Java extension. If it doesn’t help, skip to the next step.

---

### Step 3: Hide Red Lines Without Breaking Functionality
If the above steps don’t fully remove the red lines, you can tweak VSCode’s editor to hide them while keeping Java features intact.

#### **Turn Off Inline Diagnostics**
Add this to `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
    "editor.inlayHints.enabled": false,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll": false
    }
}
```
This reduces visual error indicators without disabling the Java language server entirely.

#### **Java-Specific Editor Adjustments**
For Java files only, you can minimize distractions:
```json
{
    "[java]": {
        "editor.codeLens": false,
        "editor.renderWhitespace": "none"
    }
}
```

---

### Step 4: Last Resort – Disable Java Language Server
If nothing else works and you just want the red lines gone (even if it means losing Java features like autocompletion), you can disable the Java extension for this workspace:
1. Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl + Shift + X` or `Cmd + Shift + X`).
2. Find "Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat".
3. Click the gear icon and choose "Disable (Workspace)".
4. Reload VSCode.

**Warning**: This removes all Java support, so only do this if you don’t need those features.

---

### Final Recommendation
- **Try This First**: Add the correct import and dependency (Step 1), then run `gradle clean build` and reload VSCode. This should fix the root cause.
- **If Red Lines Persist**: Use the `.vscode/settings.json` tweaks from Step 2 to ignore classpath errors.
- **Still Stuck?**: Let me know what your `build.gradle` looks like or what framework you’re using, and I’ll tailor the solution further!

Hopefully, this gets rid of those pesky red lines for "Nullable cannot resolve to a type"!
