translated: false
---

TiDB's market share as of 2025 is definitely not negligible, though it's still a niche player in the broader database market. Here's what the data shows:

**User Base and Adoption:**
- TiDB has 201 companies actively using it according to tracked data
- TiDB has over 33,000 GitHub stars and is trusted by renowned organizations globally
- There are 165 in-depth reviews from real users verified by Gartner Peer Insights

**Market Position:**
- TiDB was named as an Honorable Mention in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud DBMSs
- PingCAP received multiple awards, including 'Technology Partner of the Year' and 'Customers' Choice 2024 Gartner Peer Insights'

**Recent Growth Indicators:**
- PingCAP announced an expanded collaboration with Microsoft Azure in July 2025 to accelerate distributed SQL adoption
- The company has been actively expanding partnerships and launching new cloud offerings

**Notable Users:**
The database has some significant enterprise users, including companies like Meituan-Dianping (which serves 290 million monthly users), indicating it's handling real-world scale in production environments.

While TiDB isn't competing with giants like Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL in terms of raw market share, it's carved out a solid position in the distributed SQL database niche. It's particularly popular among companies that need horizontal scaling capabilities and real-time analytics - areas where traditional databases struggle. So while it's not mainstream, it's far from having "very few users" and continues to grow in its specialized market segment.
