Fasting means voluntarily abstaining from food, drink, or both for a specific period. It’s practiced for various reasons, including:

- **Religious/Spiritual**: Common in religions like Islam (Ramadan), Christianity (Lent), Judaism (Yom Kippur), and Hinduism, often to focus on spiritual growth, discipline, or purification.
- **Health**: Intermittent fasting or extended fasts are used for potential benefits like weight loss, improved metabolism, or cellular repair (e.g., autophagy). Examples include 16:8 (16 hours fasting, 8 hours eating) or alternate-day fasting.
- **Cultural/Traditional**: Some cultures fast during specific events or rituals.
- **Medical**: Fasting may be required before certain medical procedures, like surgery or blood tests, to ensure accurate results or safety.

Fasting can vary in intensity (e.g., complete abstinence or partial, like avoiding specific foods) and duration (hours to days). Proper hydration and medical guidance are often recommended, especially for health-related fasting.
