That story refers to the **Great Leap Forward** (1958–1962), and specifically the **backyard furnace campaign** for steel production. It is one of the most famous and devastating examples of the misguided policies during Mao Zedong's era.

Here is a breakdown of the event:

## 📢 The Backyard Furnace Campaign

The campaign was launched with the goal of rapidly transforming China from an agrarian society into a modern, industrialized communist one, matching or surpassing the industrial output of countries like Britain in a very short time.

### 🎯 The Goal: Steel

* Mao Zedong declared that **steel production** was the key indicator of a nation's modernization.
* The government set extremely ambitious and often unrealistic quotas for steel output.

### 🏡 The Method: Backyard Furnaces

* Instead of relying solely on large, industrial steel mills, the campaign mobilized the entire population to produce steel in small, homemade furnaces built in **villages, communes, schools, and even city backyards**. 
* Millions of peasants, who had no knowledge of metallurgy, were pulled from their fields to participate in the campaign.

### 🗑️ The Consequence: Melting Down the Useful

* To feed these countless furnaces, people were encouraged—or forced—to contribute **scrap metal**.
* When scrap ran out, they began melting down useful, everyday objects: **farming tools, cooking implements, door hinges, pots, and pans**. In some cases, even components from existing machinery were destroyed.
* The furnaces required massive amounts of **fuel**, leading to the widespread felling of trees and devastating deforestation in many areas.

### 📉 The Result: Useless "Steel"

* The crucial problem, as you mentioned, was the **lack of scientific method** and quality control. The small furnaces could not generate the high, sustained temperatures needed to produce high-quality steel.
* The material produced was mostly **pig iron** or, more accurately, **brittle, low-grade iron** that was often useless for industrial or construction purposes. It was typically piled up and later discarded.
* While the reported production figures initially soared (the "once high" part of your story), the actual amount of usable steel was negligible, and the official numbers were largely fabricated to meet political quotas.

## 🌾 Impact and Aftermath

* The backyard furnace campaign drew huge numbers of laborers away from farming, leading to a massive decline in agricultural output. This, combined with poor weather and flawed farming techniques dictated by the government, resulted in the **Great Chinese Famine** (also known as the Great Leap Forward Famine).
* The famine, which lasted from 1959 to 1961, is estimated to have caused tens of millions of excess deaths, making it one of the deadliest famines in human history.
* The entire Great Leap Forward, including the steel campaign, was a catastrophic economic and humanitarian failure.
