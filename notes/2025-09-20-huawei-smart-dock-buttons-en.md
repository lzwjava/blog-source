The **"side buttons"** you’re referring to on the **Huawei Smart Screen Expansion Dock (华为智慧屏拓展坞)** are likely the **physical buttons** located on the sides of the dock. Here’s what you need to know:

---

### **1. Function of the Side Buttons**
- **Connection/Release Mechanism:**
  The side buttons are typically **latch buttons** designed to **securely attach or detach the dock from the smart screen**. When you press them, the dock locks into place on the back of the smart screen. Pressing them again releases the dock, allowing you to remove it.

- **How to Use:**
  - **Press the buttons** to attach the dock to the smart screen.
  - **Press and hold** the buttons to release the dock from the smart screen.

### **2. Real Name**
- Huawei officially refers to these as **"latch buttons"** or **"locking buttons"** (卡扣按钮) in their user manuals and product descriptions. They are part of the **mechanical attachment system** for the dock.

---

### **3. Design Purpose**
- **Secure Attachment:**
  The buttons ensure the dock stays firmly connected to the smart screen, preventing accidental disconnection or wobbling during use.

- **User-Friendly:**
  The design is intuitive—press to lock, press again to unlock—making it easy for users to attach or remove the dock without tools.

- **Aesthetic Integration:**
  The buttons are usually flush with the dock’s body, maintaining a sleek and minimalist appearance while being functional.

### **4. Additional Notes**
- If the buttons feel stiff, it’s normal—they are designed to provide a secure fit.
- Always ensure the dock is properly aligned with the smart screen’s ports before pressing the buttons to avoid damage.
