### Tailored Roadmap for Learning Operating Systems and Low-Level Binary Work

Given your impressive background—top NOIP ranking, 1000+ algorithm problems, 11 years in full-stack/mobile/ML with solid C++/Java foundations, and self-taught research habits—this roadmap skips absolute beginner stuff like basic programming or CLI navigation. We'll leverage your systems knowledge (e.g., networking, containers, distributed systems) to focus on deeper OS internals and binary manipulation. Aim for 3-6 months per phase, depending on your 20-30 hours/week commitment, while balancing your TEKsystems role and side projects.

The goal: Build intuition for how software meets hardware, from process scheduling to reverse-engineering executables. This aligns with your entrepreneurial/product mindset—think applying it to optimize your GitHub repos or experiment with custom tools for your life hacks (e.g., a low-level app for gadget integration).

#### Recommended Programming Languages
- **C (Primary)**: The gold standard for OS development and low-level work. It's procedural, gives direct memory access, and underpins most kernels (e.g., Linux). Your Java/Spring experience will help with pointers and structs, but dive into unsafe ops like manual allocation.
- **Assembly (x86-64 or ARM)**: Essential for binary-level understanding. Start with x86 (common on desktops) since your Lenovo setup likely uses it. Use NASM or GAS syntax.
- **Rust (Advanced/Optional)**: For safer systems programming once comfortable with C. It's memory-safe without GC, ideal for modern kernels (e.g., Redox OS). Great for your ML/big data side—pairs well with Torch.

Avoid higher-level langs like Python/JS here; they're too abstracted. Total time to proficiency: 1-2 months for C refresh, 2-3 for Assembly.

#### Phased Learning Roadmap

##### Phase 1: OS Fundamentals (1-2 Months) – Theory + C Deep Dive
Build conceptual foundation. Focus on how OS abstracts hardware, tying into your container/distributed systems knowledge.
- **Key Topics**:
  - Processes/threads, scheduling, synchronization (mutexes, semaphores).
  - Memory management (virtual memory, paging, malloc/free internals).
  - File systems, I/O, interrupts/exceptions.
  - Kernel vs. user space, syscalls.
- **Learning Path**:
  - Read *Operating System Concepts* (9th ed., "Dinosaur Book") – Chapters 1-6, 8-10. Skim what you know from MySQL/Redis.
  - Follow GeeksforGeeks OS Tutorial for quick quizzes.
  - Hands-on: Write C programs simulating processes (e.g., producer-consumer with pthreads) and memory allocators. Use Valgrind for debugging leaks.
- **Milestone Project**: Implement a simple shell in C that handles pipes and signals (extend your existing CLI familiarity).
- **Time Tip**: 10 hours/week reading, 10 coding. Log experiments in your blog for reinforcement.

##### Phase 2: Low-Level Programming & Assembly (2 Months) – Hardware Interface
Shift to binaries: Understand machine code generation and execution.
- **Key Topics**:
  - CPU architecture (registers, ALU, pipeline).
  - Assembly basics: MOV, JMP, CALL; stack/heap ops.
  - Linking, ELF format (binaries on Linux).
  - Optimization: Inline assembly in C.
- **Learning Path**:
  - *Programming from the Ground Up* (free PDF) for x86 Assembly basics.
  - Nand2Tetris Part 1 (Coursera/ book) – Builds a computer from gates to assembler. Fun tie-in to your gadget tinkering.
  - Practice on your Intel UHD setup: Use GDB for stepping through assembly.
- **Milestone Project**: Write a bootloader in Assembly that prints "Hello Kernel" to screen (no OS). Boot it in QEMU emulator.
- **Pro Tip**: Since you're in Guangzhou, join local meetups via WeChat groups for x86 hackers—leverage your English for global Discord communities like r/asm.

##### Phase 3: Binary Working & Reverse Engineering (2-3 Months) – Dissecting Code
Apply to real binaries: Reverse-engineer apps, spot vulnerabilities.
- **Key Topics**:
  - Disassembly, decompilation.
  - Tools: Ghidra (free), Radare2, objdump.
  - Malware basics, exploits (buffer overflows).
  - Dynamic analysis (strace, ltrace).
- **Learning Path**:
  - *Practical Malware Analysis* (book) – Labs on Windows/Linux binaries.
  - LiveOverflow YouTube series on RE (start with "Binary Exploitation").
  - Follow the RE-MA Roadmap on GitHub for structured progression.
- **Milestone Project**: Reverse-engineer a simple Android APK (your mobile exp helps) or a CTF binary from PicoCTF. Patch it to bypass a check, then document on your portfolio.
- **Tie to Your Life**: Analyze a gadget app's binary for custom mods—e.g., tweak an air fryer controller if open-source.

##### Phase 4: Integration & Advanced Projects (Ongoing, 3+ Months)
Combine OS + low-level for real impact.
- **Key Topics**: Kernel modules, custom drivers, virtualization (KVM).
- **Projects**:
  - Fork xv6 (MIT's teaching OS) and add a new syscall for file encryption.
  - Build a tiny OS kernel from scratch (use OSDev wiki).
  - RE a real-world binary: Dissect an open-source tool from your GitHub (e.g., one of your 10 projects) for perf gains.
- **Advanced Twist**: Use Rust for a safe kernel module. Experiment with ARM if eyeing mobile deep dives.
- **Career Angle**: This boosts your HSBC/outsourced roles—e.g., secure microservices or debug low-level banking apps. Share progress on your blog (aim for 60k+ views milestone).

#### General Tips
- **Tools/Setup**: QEMU for emulation, GCC/Clang for C, VS Code with extensions (C/C++ IntelliSense, Assembly). Your self-taught style shines—treat this like your myopia research: Experiment, log failures.
- **Pacing**: With your reading habit (320+ books), alternate theory with 1-hour daily coding. Use AI (like me) for code reviews or grammar tweaks on posts.
- **Communities**: r/osdev, OSDev.org forums, Stack Overflow. For Chinese resources, Zhihu threads on "操作系统内核开发".
- **Measure Progress**: Solve 50+ LeetCode-style low-level problems (e.g., via HackerRank's C/Assembly tracks). Track in a Notion dashboard.

This path turns your algorithm prowess into systems mastery—imagine forking Linux for a custom travel app that hacks hotel WiFi binaries. Dive in; your track record says you'll crush it.
