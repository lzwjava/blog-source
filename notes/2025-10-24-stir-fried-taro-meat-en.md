I assume you’re asking how to cook taro with stir-fry oil and meat (possibly a typo for "meat"). Here’s a simple, clear recipe for stir-fried taro with meat, a common dish in many Asian cuisines. I’ll use pork as the meat, but you can substitute with chicken, beef, or skip it for a vegetarian version. The recipe will be concise yet comprehensive, focusing on key steps and tips.

### Stir-Fried Taro with Meat

#### Ingredients (Serves 2-3)
- 1 medium taro root (about 300-400g), peeled and cut into small cubes or thin slices
- 200g pork (tenderloin or shoulder), thinly sliced
- 2-3 tbsp cooking oil (vegetable or peanut oil)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small onion, sliced (optional)
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp oyster sauce (optional, for extra umami)
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- 1/4 cup water or chicken broth
- 1-2 green onions, chopped (for garnish)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: 1 small chili, sliced (for heat)

#### Equipment
- Wok or large non-stick skillet
- Knife and cutting board
- Peeler (for taro)

#### Instructions
1. **Prepare the Taro**:
   - Wear gloves if sensitive to taro’s skin-irritating sap. Peel the taro and cut into bite-sized cubes or thin slices (about 1/4 inch thick for even cooking).
   - Rinse taro pieces in cold water to remove excess starch. Drain and set aside.

2. **Marinate the Meat** (optional but recommended):
   - Toss pork slices with 1 tsp soy sauce, a pinch of pepper, and 1/2 tsp cornstarch. Let sit for 10 minutes to tenderize.

3. **Heat the Wok**:
   - Heat 2-3 tbsp oil in a wok over medium-high heat until shimmering.
   - Add taro pieces and stir-fry for 5-7 minutes until lightly golden and partially cooked. (Taro takes longer to cook than most vegetables, so pre-cooking ensures it’s tender.) Remove taro and set aside.

4. **Cook the Meat**:
   - In the same wok, add a little more oil if needed. Stir-fry garlic and onion (if using) for 30 seconds until fragrant.
   - Add pork slices and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until just cooked through. Avoid overcooking to keep the meat tender.

5. **Combine and Season**:
   - Return taro to the wok. Add soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), sugar, and water or broth.
   - Stir-fry for another 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until taro is tender and absorbs the flavors. Add chili for spice if desired.
   - Taste and adjust with salt and pepper.

6. **Serve**:
   - Garnish with green onions. Serve hot with steamed rice or as a side dish.

#### Tips
- **Taro Texture**: Taro should be soft and slightly creamy when fully cooked. Test with a fork; it should pierce easily.
- **Safety**: Raw taro can irritate skin or be toxic if undercooked. Ensure it’s fully cooked.
- **Variations**: Add vegetables like bell peppers or mushrooms for extra flavor. For a vegetarian version, skip meat and use tofu or extra veggies.
- **Oil**: Peanut oil adds a nutty flavor, but any neutral oil works.

#### Cooking Time
- Prep: 15 minutes
- Cooking: 15-20 minutes
- Total: ~30 minutes

If you meant something specific by “stir and oil with meet” (e.g., a particular cuisine, cut of meat, or preparation style), please clarify, and I can tailor the recipe further. For example, do you want a Chinese-style stir-fry, a Thai-inspired dish, or something else? Let me know!
