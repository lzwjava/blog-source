Yes, private repositories can use GitHub Actions as well. However, there are some differences when compared to public repositories:

1. **Usage Limits**:

   * **Free Tier**: For private repositories, GitHub provides a limited number of minutes for Actions in the free tier, based on your account type (e.g., individual or organization). You can use GitHub Actions for free with some limitations on usage.
   * **Paid Accounts**: Paid plans, such as GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, or GitHub Enterprise, provide additional minutes for Actions.

2. **Secret Management**:

   * You can use GitHub Actions with **secrets** in private repositories (for things like API keys, tokens, etc.). Secrets are encrypted and can be used securely in your workflows.

3. **External Dependencies**:

   * Some actions or integrations (like external workflows or actions from the GitHub marketplace) may require additional permissions or access, which can be managed for private repositories.

4. **Public vs Private Actions**:

   * You can still create **private actions** within your organization, but you may need to ensure that the necessary permissions are configured, especially when it comes to collaboration or team-based workflows.

In short, private repositories can use GitHub Actions without any restrictions other than the usage limits based on your plan. The key is ensuring that the secrets and workflows are correctly configured.
