Here’s what the latest insight suggests about the AI/agent industry over the **next three years (2025–2028)**. I'll focus on market growth, enterprise adoption, vertical expansion, physical agents like humanoid robots, governance and regulation, and economic impacts—without overwhelming you with a wide or hard-to-read layout.

---

## 1. Market Growth & Adoption

* The **AI agent market** is expanding explosively. It’s expected to grow from around **USD 7.38 billion in 2025** to between **USD 42.7 billion by 2030** ([Index.dev][1], [openPR.com][2]).
* Some forecasts suggest the broader **agentic AI market** (including autonomous decision-making systems) could surge to nearly **USD 199 billion by 2034**, with a strong compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of \~43.8% ([GlobeNewswire][3]).
* Organizations are ramping up AI agent investment: a **PwC survey** from May 2025 found that **88% of senior executives plan to increase AI budgets**, and **79% are already adopting AI agents**, with **66% seeing measurable productivity gains** ([PwC][4]).

**Bottom line:** Expect widespread enterprise adoption across industries, spurred by robust growth projections and strong ROI signals.

## 2. Industry Integration & Vertical Expansion

* **Salesforce** and other enterprise platforms forecast that AI agents will become like “the new apps,” autonomously embedded across workflows and simplifying task automation—from marketing to analytics ([Salesforce][5]).
* By 2025, multi-agent systems are taking hold—multiple agents coordinating across departments (e.g., marketing, sales) to achieve high-impact outcomes ([Salesforce][6]).
* Industries like **finance**, **healthcare**, and **retail** benefit from agents predicting trends, optimizing operations, and enhancing customer experiences ([Cloud Security Alliance][7]).
* In **e-commerce**, autonomous shopping agents (e.g., OpenAI’s “Agent”) perform product searches, fill carts, and even complete purchases on behalf of users—altering how brands manage visibility and SEO ([Financial Times][8]).

**Bottom line:** AI agents will deeply integrate into enterprise workflows and customer-facing functions, disrupting legacy operational models across sectors.

---

## 3. Physical Agents & Robotics

* Physical AI agents—including **humanoid robots**—are moving beyond concept into deployment. For instance, **Agility Robotics** aims to produce **10,000 humanoid robots annually** for warehouse and manufacturing roles ([The Washington Post][9]).
* **Tesla**, under Elon Musk, predicts that **80% of its future value** may come from its Optimus robots rather than electric vehicles—a bold signal of shifting strategy ([Axios][10]).
* Yet, many organizations remain cautious: Deloitte reports most **AI leaders foresee only minimal to moderate physical AI usage** in the next 2–3 years, citing cost, safety, and infrastructure constraints ([Deloitte][11]).

**Bottom line:** While humanoid and physical AI adoption is accelerating, especially in logistics and manufacturing, mass deployment will likely remain gradual due to high costs and safety concerns.

---

## 4. Workforce Transformation & Economic Impact

* The rise of “downloadable employees”—autonomous AI agents acting as digital teammates—is already visible in some UK organizations, with agents handling workstreams and returning \~\$4.5 trillion in global productivity gains ([The Times][12]).
* **Salesforce** recently replaced **4,000 customer support jobs** with AI agents, handling around 1.5 million customer interactions without impacting satisfaction—underscoring how agents are reshaping support functions ([TechRadar][13]).
* AI’s economic footprint is staggering: it may contribute up to **\$19.9 trillion** to the global economy by 2030, driven by productivity boosts, new industries, and automation of cognitive tasks ([Wikipedia][14]).

**Bottom line:** The workforce will shift—roles will evolve rather than vanish, with new roles emerging in AI oversight, ethics, and unstructured data management while agents take over repetitive or analytical work.

---

## 5. Regulation & Governance

* Most G7 nations have laid out **voluntary AI design principles**—covering transparency, red-teaming, user awareness, and post-deployment risk management ([Wikipedia][15]).
* The **EU’s AI Act** officially went into force on **1 August 2024**, with enforcement of general-purpose model provisions starting **2 August 2025**, establishing risk-based regulation for high-risk applications with oversight and compliance requirements ([Wikipedia][15]).
* As AI agents grow more autonomous, frameworks like **“guardian agents”**—AI systems supervising other AI agents—are anticipated by 2028 to ensure accountability and containment of unintended actions ([Atera][16]).

**Bottom line:** Regulation will evolve rapidly in tandem with agent proliferation, creating new standards, compliance needs, and governance structures by 2028.

---

### Summary: What to Expect by 2028

* **Rapid growth & broad adoption** as AI agent market balloons and corporations integrate agents across workflows, customer service, and product management.
* **Deep vertical integration**, with agents handling complex tasks in retail, finance, healthcare, and e-commerce—while multi-agent orchestration becomes standard.
* **Selective physical deployment** of robots and embodied agents, particularly in logistics and manufacturing, though mainstream adoption will remain limited early on.
* **Evolving workforce dynamics**, where human roles focus on supervision, creativity, and ethical governance; economic outputs and productivity soar.
* **Maturing regulatory landscape**, featuring enforceable frameworks, supervisory AI constructs, and global governance models.
