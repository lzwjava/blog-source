Ah! Got it — you're asking **why the Philippines is not a high-income country like Singapore**, or **why salaries in the Philippines are not as high as those in Singapore**. Thanks for the clarification.

Let’s break it down — this is a **deep economic and historical question**, and here are the main reasons:

---

### 🌏 1. **Different Historical Paths**
- **Singapore** was a British colony, just like the Philippines (which was colonized by Spain and later the US). But after independence in 1965, Singapore focused aggressively on industrialization, trade, education, and attracting foreign investment.
- **The Philippines**, after independence in 1946, had a promising start but suffered from **political instability, corruption, and slower economic reforms**, especially during the Marcos dictatorship (1970s–80s).

---

### 📈 2. **Economic Models**
- **Singapore** has a small population (~6 million) and focused on becoming a **global financial, tech, and shipping hub**. Its government invested heavily in infrastructure, education, and public housing.
- **The Philippines** has a much larger population (~115 million) and its economy has been more reliant on **agriculture, remittances, and services**, with less industrialization.

---

### 🧠 3. **Human Capital and Education Quality**
- Singapore invested in **world-class education and skills training**. It also emphasizes meritocracy, tech innovation, and English fluency.
- The Philippines also has strong English skills, but **underinvestment in education**, inequality in access, and brain drain (many talented workers go abroad) have held back productivity growth.

---

### 🏗️ 4. **Governance and Corruption**
- **Singapore** is famous for its **clean and efficient government**, with low corruption and strong rule of law.
- **The Philippines** has long struggled with **bureaucratic inefficiency, corruption, and dynastic politics**, which affects economic growth and investor confidence.

---

### 🚢 5. **Geography and Infrastructure**
- Singapore’s strategic location and compact geography made it ideal for being a **logistics and finance hub**.
- The Philippines is an archipelago, which creates **infrastructure challenges**, logistics complexity, and higher development costs across islands.

---

### 💵 6. **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Global Positioning**
- Singapore has one of the **highest FDI per capita** rates in the world.
- The Philippines gets FDI too, but not at the same level, due to regulatory concerns, red tape, and inconsistent policies.

---

### 📊 World Bank Classification
- As of 2024:
  - **Singapore** = **High-income** (GNI per capita > $13,845)
  - **Philippines** = **Lower-middle income**, though it's getting closer to **upper-middle income**.

---

### 🔚 TL;DR:
The Philippines is not a high-income country like Singapore due to:
- Slower industrialization
- Political and economic instability in the past
- Weaker governance and infrastructure
- Less foreign investment
- Larger population with less concentrated development
