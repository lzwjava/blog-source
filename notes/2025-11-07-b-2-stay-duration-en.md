As a Chinese citizen holding a valid B-2 tourist visa, you can typically stay in the United States for **up to 6 months (180 days)** per entry. However, the exact duration is not fixed by the visa itself—it's determined by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at your port of entry (e.g., airport) when you arrive. They will stamp your passport or issue a Form I-94 electronic record specifying your authorized stay, which is usually 6 months but could be shorter based on your travel plans, itinerary, and interview.

### Key Points:
- **Initial Stay**: Granted for 1–6 months at entry.
- **Extensions**: If needed, you can apply to USCIS (using Form I-539) for an additional up to 6 months, but the total time in B-1/B-2 status per trip is generally limited to 1 year. Approval isn't guaranteed and requires proving you'll leave the U.S. at the end.
- **No Difference for Chinese Citizens**: The stay rules are the same as for other nationalities (except specific cases like Chinese Communist Party members, whose visas may be limited to 1 month). Your B-2 visa might be valid for up to 10 years, but that's for multiple entries—each visit's stay is separate.
- **Important Rules**:
  - You must depart before your I-94 expires to avoid unlawful presence, which can lead to visa cancellation or future bans.
  - Overstaying even by 1 day starts accruing unlawful presence (180+ days can bar re-entry for 3 years).
  - You cannot work or study full-time on a B-2 visa.
- **Check Your I-94**: After arrival, verify your exact expiration date online at the CBP I-94 website.

Always bring proof of onward travel (e.g., return ticket) and sufficient funds. Rules can change, so consult official sources before travel.
