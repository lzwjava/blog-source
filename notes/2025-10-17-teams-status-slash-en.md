### Using Slash Commands to Set Status in Microsoft Teams

Slash commands in Microsoft Teams allow you to quickly update your presence status (like Available, Away, or Offline) directly from the chat interface. These work only within the Teams app (desktop, web, or mobile), not from a command line or terminal. Here's how to use them:

1. **Open Microsoft Teams** and navigate to any chat, channel, or direct message.
2. **Click in the compose box** at the bottom where you'd normally type a message.
3. **Type a forward slash (/) followed by the status command**, such as:
   - `/available` – Sets your status to Available (green dot).
   - `/away` – Sets your status to Away (yellow clock).
   - `/busy` – Sets your status to Busy (red circle).
   - `/brb` – Sets your status to Be Right Back (blue clock).
   - `/dnd` – Sets your status to Do Not Disturb (red circle with a slash).
   - `/offline` – Sets your status to Appear Offline (gray circle with an X).
4. **Press Enter** to execute the command. Your status will update immediately and be visible to others in your organization.

These changes are temporary and may reset based on your activity (e.g., after 5 minutes of inactivity, it might switch to Away automatically). To set a custom duration (e.g., Busy for 1 hour), use the profile menu instead:
- Click your profile picture in the top right.
- Hover over your current status, select a new one, then choose **Duration** and pick a time frame.

Slash commands are handy for quick toggles during conversations, but for more control, the profile menu is better.
