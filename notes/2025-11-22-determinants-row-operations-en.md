title: Determinants and Row Operations Explained
translated: false

---

That's a very common struggle! The concepts behind linear algebra operations can be less intuitive than the computational formulas. Getting from a 50 to a 60 is definitely achievable with a focused effort on the fundamentals.

Let's address your specific question about **determinants** and **row operations** first, as it highlights a key conceptual gap.

## 💡 Determinants and Row Operations

You are **partially wrong** about how row operations affect the determinant of a matrix.

The determinant of a matrix **does not always remain the same** during row operations. The effect depends on the specific operation used:

* **1. Adding a multiple of one row to another row** (e.g., \\(R_i \rightarrow R_i + cR_j\\)):
    * **Effect on \\(\det(A)\\):** **NO CHANGE**. The determinant is invariant under this operation.
    * *This is the operation you were likely thinking of.*

* **2. Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar \\(c\\)** (e.g., \\(R_i \rightarrow cR_i\\)):
    * **Effect on \\(\det(A)\\):** The new determinant is **\\(c\\) times** the old determinant.
    * *If the new matrix is \\(B\\), then \\(\det(B) = c \cdot \det(A)\\).*

* **3. Swapping two rows** (e.g., \\(R_i \leftrightarrow R_j\\)):
    * **Effect on \\(\det(A)\\):** The new determinant is **\\(-1\\) times** the old determinant (it flips the sign).
    * *If the new matrix is \\(B\\), then \\(\det(B) = -\det(A)\\).*

> **Key takeaway:** When you use row operations to achieve Row Echelon Form (REF) or Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF), you need to **keep track** of all row swaps and scalar multiplications to find the determinant of the original matrix.

## 🎯 How to Improve Your Linear Algebra Score (50 \\(\rightarrow\\) 60+)

Based on your current score and conceptual confusion, you don't necessarily need to *start everything over*, but you do need to **refocus on the core conceptual links** between different topics.

### 1. Master the Core Concepts and Definitions

A passing score often requires understanding **why** the formulas work, not just **how** to use them.

* **Linear Combination, Span, and Basis:** Understand what it means for a set of vectors to be a **linear combination** of others.
    * What is the **span** of a set of vectors?
    * What are the two requirements for a set of vectors to be a **basis**? (**Linear Independence** and **Span** the whole space).
* **Fundamental Spaces of a Matrix (\\(A\\)):** Know the relationship between these four spaces:
    * **Column Space \\(\text{Col}(A)\\):** Spanned by the pivot columns of \\(A\\). \\(\text{dim}(\text{Col}(A)) = \text{rank}(A)\\).
    * **Row Space \\(\text{Row}(A)\\):** Spanned by the non-zero rows of the REF of \\(A\\). \\(\text{dim}(\text{Row}(A)) = \text{rank}(A)\\).
    * **Null Space \\(\text{Null}(A)\\) (Kernel):** The set of all vectors \\(\mathbf{x}\\) such that \\(A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}\\). \\(\text{dim}(\text{Null}(A)) = \text{nullity}(A)\\).
    * **Left Null Space \\(\text{Null}(A^T)\\)** (Orthogonal complement of the column space).
* **The Rank-Nullity Theorem:** Understand the relationship: \\(\\)\text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = \text{number of columns}\\(\\)

### 2. Focus on The Invertible Matrix Theorem (IMT)

This is one of the most critical conceptual frameworks in introductory linear algebra. The IMT links dozens of concepts together. If you can understand *why* these statements are equivalent, you'll greatly improve your conceptual clarity.

For an \\(n \times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), the following statements are **equivalent** (all true or all false):

* \\(A\\) is **invertible**.
* The system \\(A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}\\) has a **unique solution** for every \\(\mathbf{b}\\).
* The homogeneous system \\(A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}\\) has only the **trivial solution** (\\(\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}\\)).
* The RREF of \\(A\\) is the **Identity Matrix** (\\(I_n\\)).
* \\(A\\) is a product of **elementary matrices**.
* The **\\(\det(A) \neq 0\\)**.
* The **columns of \\(A\\) are linearly independent**.
* The **rows of \\(A\\) are linearly independent**.
* The **columns of \\(A\\) span \\(\mathbb{R}^n\\)**.
* The **linear transformation \\(T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}\\) is one-to-one and onto** (bijective).
* **\\(\lambda = 0\\) is NOT an eigenvalue** of \\(A\\).
* \\(\text{rank}(A) = n\\).



### 3. Change Your Study Approach

Instead of just doing calculations, ask yourself **"Why?"** after every result:

* **Instead of:** "Calculate the determinant."
    * **Ask:** "What does this determinant (\\(\det(A) = 0\\) or \\(\det(A) \neq 0\\)) tell me about the solution to \\(A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}\\)?"
* **Instead of:** "Find the RREF."
    * **Ask:** "Which columns are **pivot columns** (basis for \\(\text{Col}(A)\\))? Which columns correspond to **free variables** (basis for \\(\text{Null}(A)\\))?"

### Summary Action Plan

1.  **Review the Rules for Determinant Operations:** Fix the mistake about row operations immediately.
2.  **Focus on the IMT:** Use this theorem as a conceptual scaffold for connecting all the topics.
3.  **Practice Conceptual Questions:** Many exam failures come from being unable to apply the concepts to theoretical questions (e.g., "If \\(A\\) is a \\(3 \times 3\\) matrix and \\(\text{Null}(A)\\) is a line, what is \\(\text{rank}(A)\\)?").

By focusing on these core connections, you'll be able to answer the conceptual questions that differentiate a score of 50 from 60 or higher.

Would you like me to walk through another key concept, like the relationship between **eigenvalues/eigenvectors** and **diagonalization**?
