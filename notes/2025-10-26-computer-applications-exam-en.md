### Understanding the Exam
The course 11325: Computer and Application Course Experiment (I) is a practical (on-machine) assessment for the Major 610201: Computer Application Technology (specialist level) at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies (GDUFS). It's a comprehensive hands-on exam worth 10 credits, designed to test your ability to apply concepts from related theory courses through real-world computer-based tasks. You must pass the following five prerequisite theory exams before registering:

- 电子技术基础(三) (Electronics Fundamentals III)
- 高级语言程序设计(一) (Advanced Language Programming I – typically C language)
- 计算机应用技术 (Computer Application Technology)
- 微型计算机及接口技术 (Microcomputer and Interface Technology)
- 数据库及其应用 (Database and Its Application)

The exam is scored as follows (out of 10 credits):
- Electronics Fundamentals III: 2 credits
- Advanced Language Programming I: 2 credits
- Microcomputer and Interface Technology: 2 credits
- Computer Application Technology: 3 credits
- Database and Its Application (experiment portion): 1 credit

It's conducted on computers, combining practical operations (e.g., coding, simulations, database queries) with some written elements. The focus is on three levels: memorization (basic concepts), comprehension (principles), and application (independent implementation). Expect tasks like writing simple programs, designing basic circuits, querying databases, and interfacing hardware/software.

### Key Topics Covered
Based on the assessment outline, the exam draws from experiments in the prerequisites. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Electronics Fundamentals III (2 credits)**:
   - Basic circuit concepts, laws (e.g., Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's laws), and analysis methods.
   - Amplifier circuits, operational amplifiers (op-amps), and their applications.
   - Digital circuits: Logic gates, flip-flops, and simple combinational/sequential logic.
   - **Skills Tested**: Simulate or draw basic circuits; calculate values using tools like Multisim or similar software.

2. **Advanced Language Programming I (2 credits)**:
   - C language basics: Variables, control structures (loops, conditionals), functions, arrays, pointers.
   - File I/O, string handling, and modular programming.
   - **Skills Tested**: Write and debug simple C programs (e.g., output leap years from 1000–2020, or basic data processing). Use an IDE like Turbo C or Dev-C++.

3. **Microcomputer and Interface Technology (2 credits)**:
   - Microprocessor basics (e.g., 8086/8088 architecture), assembly language instructions.
   - I/O interfacing: Ports, interrupts, DMA.
   - **Skills Tested**: Simple assembly code for data transfer or control; simulate hardware interfaces using tools like Proteus.

4. **Computer Application Technology (3 credits)**:
   - Office software: Word processing, spreadsheets (Excel), presentations (PowerPoint).
   - Basic multimedia and internet applications.
   - **Skills Tested**: Create documents with formulas/charts, automate tasks via macros, or build simple web forms.

5. **Database and Its Application (1 credit)**:
   - Relational database concepts (tables, queries, relationships).
   - SQL basics or Access operations: Create databases, run queries, generate reports.
   - **Skills Tested**: Design a simple database (e.g., student records), insert/update data, and query results.

### How to Prepare
Preparation should emphasize hands-on practice, as this is a practical exam. Aim for 2–3 months of focused study if you're starting from the prerequisites.

1. **Review Prerequisites**:
   - Revisit theory notes from the five courses. Focus on "experiment" chapters in textbooks (e.g., C programming exercises, circuit simulations).
   - Use official GDUFS or Guangdong self-exam textbooks:
     - C Programming: 《C语言程序设计》 (C Language Programming)
     - Database: 《数据库及其应用》 (Database and Its Application)
     - Electronics: 《电子技术基础》 (Electronics Fundamentals)

2. **Build Practical Skills**:
   - **Coding**: Install free tools like Code::Blocks for C. Practice 50–100 sample programs (e.g., sorting algorithms, file handling). Sites like LeetCode or GeeksforGeeks have beginner C challenges.
   - **Electronics/Microcomputer**: Use simulation software (Tinkercad, Logisim for digital circuits; Emu8086 for assembly). Practice wiring virtual breadboards and running simple I/O programs.
   - **Database**: Download Microsoft Access or use SQLite. Build sample DBs (e.g., inventory system) and practice queries.
   - **Applications**: Master MS Office suite. Create complex Excel sheets with pivot tables and VBA macros.

3. **Practice Exam-Like Tasks**:
   - Time yourself: Simulate 2–3 hour sessions on a computer.
   - Sample tasks (from outlines and past examples):
     - Write a C program to calculate and print leap years in a range.
     - Design a database table for students, add records, and query averages.
     - Simulate a basic op-amp circuit and compute output voltage.
   - Aim for accuracy and efficiency—exams penalize errors in code compilation or query results.

4. **Study Resources**:
   - **Official Outlines**: Download from GDUFS or Guangdong Finance University sites (they share similar standards).
   - **Mock Exams**: Search for "11325 自考 模拟题" on Chinese platforms like Zhihu or Bilibili for video walkthroughs.
   - **Online Courses**: Free MOOCs on Coursera/edX for C programming and SQL; YouTube tutorials for electronics simulations.
   - **Books**: 《计算机及应用课程实验指导》 (Computer and Application Experiment Guide) for step-by-step labs.

5. **Registration and Logistics**:
   - Register via GDUFS portal (jxjy.gdufs.edu.cn) during windows (e.g., June for second-half 2025).
   - Fee: Around 120–150 RMB. Bring ID and proof of passed prerequisites.
   - Exam Date: Typically late September for second-half; check notifications for conflicts (e.g., with national computer tests).

6. **Tips for Success**:
   - Practice daily: 1 hour coding + 1 hour simulations.
   - Debug systematically: Test code in small parts.
   - If stuck, join self-exam forums (e.g., Guangdong Zikao groups on WeChat/QQ).
   - Score 60+ to pass; focus on application level for higher grades.

With consistent practice, you'll build the confidence for the on-machine format. Good luck!
