title: Modular Code Improves Readability
translated: false

Yes, splitting 100 lines of code into several functions improves readability and understanding. Function names act like labels, describing what each chunk of code does, which makes the logic easier to follow. It also organizes the code into logical categories, reducing complexity and making maintenance or debugging simpler. For example, instead of a long script, functions like `calculateTotal`, `fetchData`, or `renderOutput` clearly indicate their purpose.

This approach aligns with principles like modular programming and the single responsibility principle, where each function handles one specific task. It’s easier to scan, test, and reuse smaller, well-named functions than a monolithic block of code.

If you have a specific code example, I can help break it down to demonstrate!
