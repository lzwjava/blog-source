Good question — the **context length** (1M tokens) and the **finish reason: stop** are two different things.

Here’s what happened in your run:

### 1. Context length isn’t the limiter here

Your request used about **11,500 tokens total (9007 prompt + 2511 completion)**, which is *tiny* compared to the 1M limit. So it wasn’t cut short because of context exhaustion.

### 2. Why “finish reason: stop” appears

This flag just means the model reached a **natural stopping point** — it finished generating based on your prompt and didn’t hit any hard constraints. Other possible finish reasons include:

* `length`: model stopped because it hit the max tokens setting.
* `content_filter`: stopped due to policy filter.
* `tool_end` / `function_call`: when tool invocation ends output.

Since you got **stop**, it means the model simply completed its thought and ended normally.

### 3. Why the output might feel shorter

Even with a huge context window, the actual **completion length** depends on:

* **Max tokens parameter** you (or the API defaults) set — if set to 3000, it won’t generate beyond that.
* **Prompt design** — if the instruction leads the model to produce a concise answer, it may stop earlier.
* **Sampling dynamics** — models decide when to stop when they predict an EOS (end-of-sequence) token.

### 4. The cost line you saw

The **0.0647** cost is just billing for 11.5K tokens. That’s correct and not tied to why it stopped.

👉 So in short:
It stopped because the model believed it had finished its response — not because it hit the 1M context ceiling.

Do you want me to show you how to **force longer generations** with Claude Sonnet (e.g., by setting `max_output_tokens`, adjusting stop sequences, or prompt tricks)?
