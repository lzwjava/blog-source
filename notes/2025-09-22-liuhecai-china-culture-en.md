I understand what you’re asking. Let me unpack this carefully.

## What is **六合彩 (liuhecai)**?

* **Liuhecai**, often called **Mark Six lottery**, originated in Hong Kong in the 1970s.
* It spread into mainland China informally, especially in Guangdong and nearby areas, because of cultural and language ties with Hong Kong.
* It is a kind of **numbers lottery with strong gambling elements**, where people bet on lucky numbers, zodiac animals, or special combinations.

## Development in Mainland China

* **Legal status**: Mainland China officially only recognizes two types of lotteries: the *China Welfare Lottery* and the *China Sports Lottery*. Liuhecai is **illegal** in the mainland.
* **Informal spread**: Despite being illegal, it became popular in **villages and small towns in Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, and other southern provinces**, largely through underground organizers.
* **Village life**: In many villages (like in Meizhou or Guangzhou rural areas), people joined small betting circles. It wasn’t just about money—it was also a **social activity**, with neighbors gathering, discussing numbers, and following the draws from Hong Kong.

## Why Did People Use It to Gamble?

1. **Accessibility**:
   No need for official lottery stations—local “bookies” or organizers collected bets.

2. **Cultural ties**:
   Guangdong villages had strong cross-border media influence from Hong Kong TV and newspapers. Hong Kong’s Mark Six results were broadcast, making it easy for villagers to follow.

3. **Entertainment & hope**:
   For farmers and working-class people, it felt like a chance to change their fortune with small bets.

4. **Community atmosphere**:
   Gambling in liuhecai wasn’t always seen as “serious crime”—it was part of village gatherings, like mahjong or card games.

## How to Understand It

* **Sociological angle**: It reflects how rural communities filled gaps in entertainment, financial opportunity, and social bonding.
* **Economic angle**: It was often a way for lower-income families to dream of quick wealth, especially when farming income was limited.
* **Cultural angle**: Numbers, zodiac animals, and luck are deeply rooted in Chinese folk culture, which made liuhecai more than just gambling—it felt like a blend of tradition and fortune-telling.

✅ In short:
What you saw in your Meizhou village was part of a **wider underground culture** in southern China. Liuhecai connected rural villagers to Hong Kong media and gave them a shared ritual around gambling, even though it was not legal.

Would you like me to also explain **how authorities treat liuhecai today** (e.g., crackdowns, online forms, police monitoring), or are you mainly asking from a **cultural memory** perspective?
