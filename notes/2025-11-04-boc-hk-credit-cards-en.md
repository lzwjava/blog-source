### Eligibility for Mainland Chinese Citizens Applying for BOC HK Credit Cards

As a mainland Chinese citizen (non-Hong Kong resident), you can apply for most Bank of China (Hong Kong) - BOC HK - credit cards, provided you meet the general criteria: aged 18 or above, with stable legitimate income (typically HKD 96,000+ annually, varying by card), and no adverse credit history. Your existing BOC HK account, BOC Pay+, and UnionPay debit card will strengthen your application as an existing customer, potentially speeding up approval and allowing online submission via the BOC HK app or website.

Key points:
- **Non-resident status**: You'll apply as a non-HK resident (no HKID required). Submit a valid passport, Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents (Home Return Permit), and a copy of your mainland ID (hukou or residence permit). Proof of address (e.g., utility bill or bank statement from the last 3 months) is also needed.
- **Dual Currency Cards**: Many popular options are UnionPay Dual Currency cards (HKD + CNY), ideal for cross-border use, with no foreign transaction fees on CNY spends in mainland China.
- **Application Methods**: 
  - **Online**: Via BOC HK mobile app, website (bochk.com), or BOC Credit Card online portal. Upload documents digitally.
  - **Branch**: Visit any BOC HK branch in Hong Kong with originals.
  - **Phone**: Call 24-hour hotline (852) 2853 8828 for guidance.
- **Processing**: Approval takes 7-14 days; credit limit based on income and credit check (shared across BOC cards). As an existing account holder, you may get priority.
- **Recent Update (2025)**: Since March 2025, HK banks like BOC HK can issue cards directly in mainland China via select branches, but for HK-issued cards, apply as above.
