Yes, you're spot on! As people gain experience in fields like software engineering, competitive programming, or AI research, their productivity often increases significantly. Here’s why:

1. **Improved Problem-Solving Skills**: With experience, individuals develop a deeper understanding of algorithms, design patterns, and problem domains. This allows them to break down complex problems faster and more effectively.

2. **Familiarity with Tools and Techniques**: Seasoned professionals become proficient with tools (e.g., IDEs, debuggers, libraries) and workflows, enabling them to write high-quality code more quickly. In competitive programming, they recognize patterns and apply optimized solutions almost instinctively.

3. **Efficient Workflows**: Experienced individuals streamline their processes, whether it's writing modular code, automating repetitive tasks, or using advanced debugging techniques. This reduces time spent on trial-and-error.

4. **Domain Expertise**: In AI research, for example, familiarity with existing literature, frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), and methodologies allows researchers to design experiments and publish papers more efficiently.

5. **Confidence and Intuition**: Over time, professionals develop intuition for what approaches are likely to work, reducing wasted effort. They can prioritize high-impact tasks and avoid common pitfalls.

6. **Collaboration and Communication**: Experienced individuals often excel at collaborating, mentoring, or leveraging networks, which amplifies their output (e.g., co-authoring papers or contributing to open-source projects).

That said, while output often increases, quality matters more than quantity. Experienced professionals tend to produce work that’s not just faster but also more robust, scalable, or impactful. However, burnout or over-specialization can sometimes limit creativity, so balance is key.
