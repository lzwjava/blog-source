The GitHub repository `ericc-ch/copilot-api` is an open-source TypeScript project that offers a reverse-engineered proxy server to access GitHub Copilot's AI functionality as an OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible API. It enables integration with tools like Claude Code, allowing users to leverage Copilot's code generation and completion features through a standardized API format. As of the latest data, it has over 1,200 stars and 203 forks on GitHub.[1][2][3]

### How It Works
This proxy is designed to expose GitHub Copilot's underlying API, which is not publicly available from GitHub, but uses reverse engineering to intercept and reroute requests. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

- **Proxy Mechanism**: The server acts as a middleware between client applications (e.g., tools expecting OpenAI or Anthropic-style APIs) and GitHub's Copilot service. It transforms incoming requests into the format that Copilot expects and relays responses back in a compatible output.[1][2]

- **API Compatibility**: Specifically, it mimics the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models and Anthropic's Claude models, allowing integration with existing developer tools without needing Copilot's native clients. Recent updates (e.g., version v0.5.14) have included fixes for issues like image URL handling and optimizations for tools like Claude Code.[1][4][2]

- **Setup and Usage**:
  - Clone or download the repository.
  - Install dependencies (using npm or similar for TypeScript).
  - Run the server, typically with authentication to your GitHub Copilot account (as it requires a valid Copilot subscription).
  - Configure client apps to point to the proxy's endpoint instead of direct OpenAI/Anthropic APIs.[2][3]

- **Key Features and Improvements**: The project includes error handling for common issues (e.g., HTTP 421 or 500 errors when using with tools like Aider), support for logging (--log-file option), and continuous development through pull requests addressing bugs and enhancements.[5][6][4]

For detailed instructions, refer to the project's README on GitHub. Note that this is unofficial and depends on GitHub's internal API, which could change unexpectedly.[1][2][3]

### Potential Risks
Using reverse-engineered proxies may violate GitHub's terms of service, and its reliability could be affected by updates to Copilot's API.[7]
