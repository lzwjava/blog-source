Spring Boot and Play Framework are both popular tools for building web applications, but they cater to slightly different needs and preferences. Whether Spring Boot is "better" than Play Framework depends on your project requirements, team expertise, and goals. Let’s break it down based on their strengths and tradeoffs:

### Why Spring Boot Might Be Preferred
1. **Ecosystem and Maturity**  
   Spring Boot is part of the broader Spring ecosystem, which has been around since 2002 and is widely adopted in enterprise environments. It offers a massive collection of libraries and tools (e.g., Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring Cloud) that integrate seamlessly, making it ideal for complex, large-scale applications. Play Framework, while solid, has a smaller ecosystem and isn’t as deeply entrenched in enterprise settings.

2. **Convention Over Configuration**  
   Spring Boot simplifies Java development with sensible defaults and auto-configuration. You can get a production-ready app running quickly with minimal setup (e.g., embedded servers like Tomcat or Jetty). Play also follows this philosophy, but Spring Boot’s approach feels more polished for Java developers, especially with its extensive starter dependencies via Maven or Gradle.

3. **Flexibility**  
   Spring Boot supports both traditional MVC apps and modern reactive programming (via Spring WebFlux). This makes it versatile for everything from monoliths to microservices. Play Framework also supports reactive programming (built on Akka), but its focus leans more toward lightweight, stateless apps, which might limit flexibility in some scenarios.

4. **Community and Support**  
   Spring Boot has a larger community, more tutorials, and extensive documentation. If you run into issues, you’re more likely to find answers quickly. Play Framework, maintained by Lightbend, has a smaller but dedicated community, which can mean less readily available help.

5. **Integration with Java Ecosystem**  
   Spring Boot integrates effortlessly with existing Java tools (e.g., Hibernate, JPA, JUnit) and enterprise systems (e.g., LDAP, JMS). If your team is already in the Java world, Spring Boot feels like a natural fit. Play, while Java-compatible, is more Scala-friendly and might require extra effort to align with traditional Java stacks.

### Where Play Framework Shines (and Spring Boot Might Lag)
1. **Lightweight and Reactive by Default**  
   Play was designed with a reactive, non-blocking architecture from the ground up, making it a great choice for high-performance, real-time apps (e.g., streaming or chat services). Spring Boot can achieve this with WebFlux, but its reactive support feels like an add-on rather than a core feature.

2. **Simplicity for Small Projects**  
   Play’s stateless design and built-in tools (e.g., hot reloading, Play console) make it quick to spin up small, agile projects. Spring Boot, while streamlined, can feel heavier due to its enterprise roots, especially if you don’t need all its features.

3. **Scala Support**  
   Play has first-class support for Scala, which appeals to developers who prefer functional programming. Spring Boot is Java-first and, while it supports Kotlin, it’s not as idiomatic for Scala users.

### Practical Considerations
- **Performance**: Play’s lightweight nature might edge out Spring Boot in raw speed for simple apps, but Spring Boot’s performance is more than adequate for most use cases, especially with optimizations.
- **Learning Curve**: Spring Boot can be intimidating for beginners due to its breadth, while Play’s simplicity makes it easier to pick up for smaller teams or startups.
- **Deployment**: Both frameworks support embedded servers, but Spring Boot’s integration with cloud platforms (e.g., Spring Cloud AWS) gives it an edge for enterprise deployments.

### Conclusion
Spring Boot is often "better" if you need a robust, flexible framework with a massive ecosystem, strong Java integration, and enterprise-grade features. It’s the go-to for complex, scalable systems where long-term maintainability matters. Play Framework, on the other hand, excels in lightweight, reactive, or Scala-based projects where simplicity and performance are top priorities.

If you’re working on a Java-heavy, enterprise-level project with a team familiar with Spring, Spring Boot is likely the smarter pick. For a quick, reactive app or a Scala shop, Play might suit you better. What’s your project context? I can tailor this further if you share more details!
