**Dayton Clarence Miller (1866-1941) was a distinguished American physicist, astronomer, and acoustician.** He was also an accomplished amateur flutist and a notable collector of flutes. Miller spent the majority of his career as a professor at the Case School of Applied Science (now part of Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio, where he also served as the head of the physics department.

Miller was involved in various areas of physics, including early work with X-rays and significant contributions to the study of acoustics, particularly the physics of musical sounds and architectural acoustics. He invented the phonodeik, a device used to visually record sound waves.

**The experiment Dayton Miller is most famous for is his extensive series of experiments attempting to detect the luminiferous aether, often referred to as the aether drift experiment.** Building upon the work of Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, Miller conducted numerous repetitions of the Michelson-Morley experiment over several decades, primarily at Mount Wilson Observatory.

The Michelson-Morley experiment aimed to detect the hypothetical aether, which was thought to be the medium through which light waves propagated. The Earth's movement through this aether was expected to create a detectable "aether wind," which would affect the speed of light depending on the direction of measurement. The original Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 famously yielded a null result, meaning no significant aether drift was detected, which was a crucial piece of evidence supporting Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity.

Miller, however, believed his experiments showed a small, positive result indicating the existence of an aether drift. His findings were controversial and not consistently supported by other experiments. Despite his meticulous work and dedication, the scientific consensus ultimately aligned with the null results, further solidifying the foundations of special relativity, which does not require the concept of a luminiferous aether. Nevertheless, Miller's experiments were significant for their scale and precision at the time and contributed to the ongoing scientific discourse about the nature of space and light in the early 20th century.
