### Common Chemical Ingredients in Daily Life, Similar to Hydrogen Peroxide

Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is a versatile chemical often found in household disinfectants, hair bleaches, and oral rinses due to its oxidizing properties. Here are some other common chemical ingredients you'll encounter in everyday products, from cleaning supplies to food and personal care. I've focused on widely used ones with simple, practical applications:

- **Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO₃, Baking Soda)**: A mild alkali used in baking (to help dough rise), cleaning (deodorizing fridges or scrubbing surfaces), and even fire extinguishers. It's non-toxic and eco-friendly.
  
- **Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH, Vinegar)**: The key ingredient in white vinegar, employed for pickling food, descaling appliances, and as a natural weed killer. It's a weak acid that's safe for most household tasks.

- **Sodium Hypochlorite (NaOCl, Bleach)**: Found in laundry and bathroom cleaners, it disinfects surfaces, whitens fabrics, and removes stains by breaking down organic matter—much like hydrogen peroxide but stronger.

- **Ammonia (NH₃)**: A basic compound in glass cleaners and floor polishes; it cuts through grease and leaves streak-free shines. (Avoid mixing with bleach, as it produces toxic gas.)

- **Ethanol (C₂H₅OH, Alcohol)**: In hand sanitizers, mouthwashes, and alcoholic beverages; it acts as a solvent, antiseptic, and flavor enhancer.

- **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl, Muriatic Acid)**: Diluted in toilet bowl cleaners to dissolve mineral deposits and rust; it's a strong acid but handled carefully in low concentrations.

- **Acetone (C₃H₆O)**: The active solvent in nail polish remover; it dissolves resins and is also used in some paints and adhesives.

- **Phosphoric Acid (H₃PO₄)**: Added to sodas for tangy flavor and as a preservative; in cleaners, it tackles rust and lime scale.

These chemicals are staples in homes worldwide, often in diluted forms for safety. Always check labels for concentrations and ventilation needs.
