### Ingredients (for 1 serving)
- 1 fresh lemon (buy a juicy one from your local grocery store or market)
- 1 black tea bag or 1 tsp loose black tea leaves (red tea, like English Breakfast or Assam)
- 1 cup (240 ml) hot water
- Ice cubes (optional, for iced version)
- 1-2 tsp sugar or honey (optional, to taste)
- A "xueke cup" (assuming this is a shaker cup or cocktail shaker for mixing)

### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Buy and prepare the lemon**: Pick a bright, firm lemon. Wash it under running water. Cut it in half and squeeze out the juice from one half (about 2 tbsp). Slice the other half into thin wedges for garnish or extra flavor.

2. **Brew the red tea**: Boil water in a kettle or pot. Place the black tea bag (or loose leaves in a strainer) in a mug or teapot. Pour 1 cup of hot water (around 95°C/200°F) over the tea. Steep for 3-5 minutes for a strong flavor—don't oversteep or it might get bitter. Remove the tea bag or strainer.

3. **Sweeten if desired**: Stir in sugar or honey while the tea is hot so it dissolves easily.

4. **Mix in the xueke cup**: Pour the hot brewed tea into your xueke cup (shaker). Add the fresh lemon juice. If making iced lemon tea, add a handful of ice cubes now. Seal the cup tightly and shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds to blend the flavors and chill it.

5. **Serve**: Pour the shaken lemon tea into a glass over more ice if you like it cold. Garnish with a lemon wedge. Enjoy hot or iced!

This simple method gives you a refreshing, tangy lemon tea. Adjust lemon for more tartness. Total time: 10 minutes.
