title: Setting Up BeyondCompare with Git Difftool
translated: false
---

To set up Beyond Compare as the `git difftool`, follow these steps. These instructions assume you have Beyond Compare installed and Git configured on your system.

### Steps to Configure Beyond Compare as `git difftool`

1. **Check Beyond Compare Installation**
   Ensure Beyond Compare is installed and accessible from the command line. You can verify this by running:
   ```
   bcomp
   ```
   If it’s not recognized, ensure the Beyond Compare executable (e.g., `BCompare.exe` on Windows or `bcomp` on macOS/Linux) is in your system’s PATH.

2. **Configure Git to Use Beyond Compare**
   Run the following Git configuration commands in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   git config --global diff.tool bc
   git config --global difftool.bc.path "path/to/bcomp"
   git config --global difftool.prompt false
   ```

   - Replace `"path/to/bcomp"` with the actual path to the Beyond Compare executable:
     - **Windows**: Typically `"C:\Program Files\Beyond Compare 4\BCompare.exe"`. Use double backslashes (`\\`) or forward slashes (`/`) in the path.
     - **macOS**: Usually `/Applications/Beyond Compare.app/Contents/MacOS/bcomp`.
     - **Linux**: Often `/usr/bin/bcomp` or wherever `bcomp` is installed.
   - The `difftool.prompt false` setting prevents Git from prompting you to launch the difftool for each file.

3. **(Optional) Configure for Merge Tool**
   If you also want to use Beyond Compare as your `mergetool`, add these commands:

   ```bash
   git config --global merge.tool bc
   git config --global mergetool.bc.path "path/to/bcomp"
   git config --global mergetool.prompt false
   ```

4. **Test the Configuration**
   To verify the setup, create or navigate to a Git repository with changes and run:

   ```bash
   git difftool
   ```

   This should launch Beyond Compare to display the differences between your modified files and the last commit. If you’re using it as a mergetool, test with:

   ```bash
   git mergetool
   ```

   (This applies only if you have merge conflicts.)

5. **Specific Notes for Platforms**
   - **Windows**: Ensure you use the correct path to `BCompare.exe`. If the path contains spaces, enclose it in quotes.
   - **macOS/Linux**: The `bcomp` command often needs to wait for Beyond Compare to close before returning control to the terminal. Beyond Compare’s documentation suggests it handles this automatically, but if Git exits prematurely, you may need to adjust scripts or use a wrapper (see Beyond Compare’s support for details).
   - If you encounter issues, verify the path and ensure Beyond Compare is licensed and functional.

6. **Example Configuration for Windows**
   For Beyond Compare 4 on Windows, the commands might look like:

   ```bash
   git config --global diff.tool bc
   git config --global difftool.bc.path "C:\\Program Files\\Beyond Compare 4\\BCompare.exe"
   git config --global difftool.prompt false
   git config --global merge.tool bc
   git config --global mergetool.bc.path "C:\\Program Files\\Beyond Compare 4\\BCompare.exe"
   git config --global mergetool.prompt false
   ```

7. **Verify Configuration**
   Check your Git configuration to ensure the settings are applied:

   ```bash
   git config --global --list
   ```

   Look for entries like `diff.tool=bc` and `difftool.bc.path`.

### Additional Tips
- **Comparing Specific Files**: Use `git difftool <file>` to compare a specific file.
- **Comparing Branches**: Use `git difftool branch1 branch2` to compare differences between two branches.
- **Beyond Compare Settings**: In Beyond Compare, you can customize comparison rules (e.g., ignoring whitespace) via its interface for better diff visualization.
- **Troubleshooting**: If Beyond Compare doesn’t launch, double-check the path in the `difftool.bc.path` setting. Use `which bcomp` (macOS/Linux) or `where BCompare.exe` (Windows) to locate the executable.

This setup should enable you to use Beyond Compare seamlessly with `git difftool` and, optionally, `git mergetool`. If you run into specific issues, let me know your operating system and any error messages for more tailored advice!
