### Enrollment Process
This school does not offer open public enrollment. Admission is **exclusively for children of in-service (在编在岗) faculty and staff at South China Normal University**. This policy has remained consistent based on recent announcements (e.g., for the 2024 academic year).

#### Eligibility and Steps (General Process, Based on 2024 Guidelines; Similar for 2025):
- **Target Group**: Children of SCNU's full-time, on-duty employees.
- **Age Requirement**: Children who turn 6 by August 31 of the enrollment year (e.g., born on or before August 31, 2019, for the 2025-2026 school year).
- **Process**:
  1. **Preliminary Survey (Motto Bottom Check)**: Parents complete an online registration form (typically announced in early April via SCNU's internal channels or department notices). This includes basic child information and proof of parent employment at SCNU.
  2. **Verification**: Submit documents like household registration (hukou), birth certificate, and employment proof. The school conducts reviews to confirm eligibility.
  3. **Admission Confirmation**: Qualified families receive placement notices. No entrance exams; it's based on quota availability tied to university staff numbers.
  4. **Timeline**: Surveys and registrations usually occur in spring (March-April). For 2025, this would have been completed earlier in the year, but check SCNU's staff portal for any updates.

If you're not affiliated with SCNU, consider other affiliated branches (e.g., in Nansha or Zengcheng districts), which may have broader residential-based admissions. For official updates, contact the school directly at their listed numbers or visit SCNU's education department.
