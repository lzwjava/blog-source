These results further cemented his reputation as a versatile-dot-com competitive powerhouse.

#### International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)
As a student at the University of Warsaw, Gąsienica-Samek led the university’s team to historic success in the ICPC, a team-based programming competition for university students. Under the guidance of professors Jan Madey and Krzysztof Diks, he was a key member of the team that achieved:
- **2003 ICPC World Finals (Beverly Hills, USA)**: 1st place, marking the first time a Polish team won the world championship. The team, consisting of Gąsienica-Samek, Tomasz Czajka, and Krzysztof Onak, outperformed 3,850 teams from 1,329 universities across 68 countries, solving problems with such dominance that they secured a significant lead.
- **Central European Programming Contest**: Champion in 2001 and 2003, and runner-up in 2002.
- **Polish Collegiate Programming Contest**: Champion in 2001, runner-up in 2002 and 2003.

His leadership and problem-solving skills were instrumental in these victories, with teammates noting his ability to coordinate effectively and assign tasks based on individual strengths.

### Academic and Professional Career
Gąsienica-Samek pursued a degree in computer science at the University of Warsaw, where he developed the theoretical and practical skills that complemented his competitive experience. After graduating, he joined **Comarch**, Poland’s second-largest software company at the time, where he was offered the role of heading a newly created R&D department. His team developed a tool for generating readable Excel printouts, though it achieved limited commercial success. After three years, he transitioned to Comarch’s public administration solutions department, where his team created a document circulation system praised by the Silesian Voivodeship Office. He left Comarch amicably after five years to pursue entrepreneurial ventures.

### Entrepreneurial Ventures
In 2008, Gąsienica-Samek founded **Atinea Sp. z o.o.**, a software outsourcing company specializing in custom solutions. Initially broad in scope, Atinea grew steadily, focusing on high-quality code architecture and innovative programming languages like **NianioLang**, a procedural language designed to eliminate pointers and enhance code reliability. By 2020, Atinea generated $1.2 million in revenue, with 10% reinvested in R&D, and employed 80 people. Despite challenges, such as losing a major client, the company maintained stable growth.

Gąsienica-Samek also launched two education-focused subsidiaries:
- **InstaLing (2013)**: A platform for learning English vocabulary, used by 6,000 teachers and 200,000 students daily. The basic version is free, with revenue generated from a premium version.
- **InstaKod (2019)**: A platform for teaching computer science and programming, featuring a simplified assembler language (NianioLang) and a textbook approved by Poland’s Ministry of National Education. InstaKod also organizes the **InstaLogik** competition to engage young students in programming.

Currently, Gąsienica-Samek employs 100 people across these ventures, with Atinea and its subsidiaries making significant contributions to both industry and education.

### Contributions to Education and Mentorship
Gąsienica-Samek is deeply committed to nurturing young talent, a passion reflected in his educational initiatives. Through InstaKod and InstaLing, he has impacted thousands of students and teachers, providing accessible tools to learn programming and languages. His involvement with **InstaKółko**, a programming course platform, emphasizes rigorous, hands-on learning, inspired by his own competitive training. His son, **Adam Gąsienica-Samek**, has followed in his footsteps, earning a gold medal and second place at the 2024 IOI, with Andrzej’s mentorship playing a key role in his success.

### Personal Philosophy and Legacy
Reflecting on his career, Gąsienica-Samek has expressed that while founding a startup was the right decision in the early 2000s due to limited opportunities in Poland’s IT sector, he might not make the same choice today given the abundance of tech jobs. His approach to programming emphasizes simplicity, reliability, and architectural clarity over micro-optimizations, as seen in his work on NianioLang. His competitive philosophy—prioritizing creative thinking and teamwork—continues to influence his business and educational endeavors.

### Family and Personal Life
Andrzej is married to **Ewa Gąsienica-Samek**, a mathematician and educator who co-founded InstaKółko and developed the pedagogical framework for InstaKod. Their son, Adam, is a rising star in competitive programming, continuing the family’s legacy. Andrzej’s father played a pivotal role in his early programming education, and there may be a familial connection to **Mieczysław Gąsienica-Samek**, a decorated Polish skier and WWII veteran, though this is unconfirmed.

### Recognition and Impact
Gąsienica-Samek’s achievements have earned him a place in the **Competitive Programming Hall of Fame**. His leadership in the 2003 ICPC victory is celebrated as a milestone for Polish programming, and his contributions to education through InstaLing and InstaKod have democratized access to learning. His work on NianioLang and Atinea reflects a commitment to advancing software engineering practices, while his mentorship ensures his expertise benefits future generations.
