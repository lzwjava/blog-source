### 2. **History**
China boasts one of the world’s oldest continuous civilizations, dating back over 5,000 years.  

- **Ancient China**:  
  - Dynasties like the Xia (c. 2070–1600 BCE, semi-mythical), Shang (c. 1600–1046 BCE), and Zhou (c. 1046–256 BCE) laid the foundation for Chinese culture, philosophy, and governance.  
  - The Qin Dynasty (221–206 BCE) unified China under Emperor Qin Shi Huang, standardizing writing, currency, and measurements, and beginning the Great Wall.  
  - The Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) established Confucianism as a state ideology and expanded trade via the Silk Road.  
  - Subsequent dynasties, including the Tang (618–907 CE, a golden age of arts and trade), Song, Yuan (Mongol rule), Ming, and Qing, shaped China’s cultural and political identity.  

- **Modern History**:  
  - The Qing Dynasty’s decline in the 19th century led to foreign invasions and unequal treaties during the "Century of Humiliation."  
  - The 1911 Xinhai Revolution ended imperial rule, establishing the Republic of China (ROC).  
  - Civil war between the Nationalists (Kuomintang) and Communists led to the founding of the PRC in 1949 under Mao Zedong, with the ROC retreating to Taiwan.  
  - Mao’s policies, like the Great Leap Forward (1958–1962) and Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), caused significant hardship but centralized Communist control.  
  - Deng Xiaoping’s reforms in the late 1970s opened China’s economy, leading to rapid growth and modernization.  

- **Contemporary China**:  
  - Under Xi Jinping (2012–present), China has pursued global influence through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and strengthened domestic control.  
  - Tensions persist over Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea, alongside human rights concerns in Xinjiang and Tibet.
