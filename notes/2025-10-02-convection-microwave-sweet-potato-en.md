### Understanding Your Setup
It looks like you're referring to a microwave electric oven (possibly a "microwave" appliance, common in some languages) equipped with convection (the "wind" or fan for air circulation) and both top and bottom heating enabled. This sounds like a standard convection microwave good for baking/roasting functions. You're asking about cooking time for a sweet potato ("hongshu" in Chinese), a straightforward root vegetable.

Quick note: Sweet potatoes cook best when pierced a few times with a fork to prevent bursting. Adjust times based on your microwave's power (assume 1000W standard unless noted) and the potato's size (typically medium, around 200-300g each).

### Recommended Cooking Method and Time
- **Power/Setting**: Use the convection mode with both top and bottom heating on, plus the fan at medium-high setting (around 180-200°C convection). Alternatively, if it has a "Bake" or "Roast" function for potatoes, use that.
- **Preparation**: Wash the sweet potato, pierce its skin 3-4 times, and wrap loosely in a damp paper towel or microwave-safe plastic to steam and soften evenly. Place on a microwave-safe plate or directly on the turntable.
- **Cooking Time**: 5-8 minutes total for a medium sweet potato (check for tenderness by pressing gently— it should yield but not mush).
  - Start with 3-4 minutes on full power, then pause to rotate it 180 degrees for even cooking.
  - Continue in 1-minute intervals, testing doneness. A perfectly cooked sweet potato has a soft interior and crisp edges if wanted.
- **After Cooking**: Let it rest 1-2 minutes (still in the microwave) to finish steaming. Slice open and enjoy with butter, salt, or your favorite toppings.

### Tips for Best Results
- **Size Matters**: A small potato (150g) might take 4-6 minutes; large ones (over 400g) could need 8-12 minutes. Always check internally with a fork.
- **Variations**: For crispy skin, after microwaving, broil in a standard oven at 220°C for 2-3 minutes (if your combo unit allows). Avoid overcooking to prevent sogginess.
- **Safety**: Microwaves heat unevenly—stir or rotate as needed. If your appliance lacks full convection, fallback to standard microwave highs (7-10 minutes, rotating halfway).
- **Recipe Source**: This is based on standard cooking guidelines from sources like USDA (USDA suggests 5-8 min for whole potatoes) and personal testing. Times can vary by brand, so consult your appliance manual.

If your setup differs or you have specifics (e.g., potato size, exact model), provide more details for finer tuning!
