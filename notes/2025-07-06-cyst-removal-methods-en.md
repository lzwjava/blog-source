When a doctor or nurse ruptures (or more accurately, *drains* or *excises*) a cyst, they follow specific medical procedures to ensure safety, minimize pain, and reduce the risk of complications like infection or recurrence. The exact method depends on the type, size, and location of the cyst, as well as whether it's infected.

Here's a general overview of how they might do it:

**1. Assessment and Preparation:**
* **Diagnosis:** First, they will examine the cyst and might use imaging (like ultrasound) to confirm it's a cyst, determine its size and contents, and rule out other conditions.
* **Sterile Field:** The area around the cyst will be thoroughly cleaned with an antiseptic solution (like iodine or chlorhexidine) to kill bacteria. Sterile drapes will be placed around the site to maintain a clean working area.
* **Anesthesia:** A local anesthetic (like lidocaine) will be injected into the skin around the cyst to numb the area. You might feel a brief sting or burning sensation from the injection, but after that, you shouldn't feel pain during the procedure, only possibly some pressure or tugging.

**2. Methods of Cyst Treatment:**

There are two main approaches:

* **Incision and Drainage (I&D):**
    * This is often used for infected or abscessed cysts that are very painful and swollen.
    * The doctor or nurse will make a small incision (cut) with a sterile scalpel over the cyst.
    * They will then gently drain the contents of the cyst (pus, fluid, or cheesy material) by applying pressure or using instruments.
    * Sometimes, the cavity might be packed with gauze to help it drain further and heal from the inside out. This packing may need to be changed regularly.
    * **Important note:** While I&D provides immediate relief, it doesn't remove the cyst "sac" or "lining." This means the cyst has a higher chance of recurring because the cells that produce the cyst contents are still present.

* **Excision (Surgical Removal):**
    * This is the preferred method for many types of cysts, especially if they are causing recurrent problems, are very large, or if the doctor wants to prevent recurrence.
    * After numbing the area, the doctor will make a slightly larger incision, often elliptical (oval-shaped), around the cyst.
    * Using precise surgical instruments, they will carefully dissect and remove the *entire cyst sac* (the wall of the cyst) along with its contents. Removing the whole sac is crucial to prevent the cyst from growing back.
    * Once the cyst is removed, any minor bleeding will be controlled.
    * The incision will then be closed with stitches, sometimes both internal (dissolvable) and external.
    * A sterile dressing will be applied.

**3. Post-Procedure Care:**
* You'll receive instructions on how to care for the wound, including keeping it clean, changing dressings, and watching for signs of infection.
* Pain medication may be prescribed or recommended if needed.
* Follow-up appointments may be scheduled to check healing or remove stitches.

**Why Professional Treatment is Essential:**

Doctors and nurses have:
* **Sterile Equipment:** They use properly sterilized instruments to prevent infection.
* **Anesthesia:** They can effectively numb the area to ensure a relatively pain-free procedure.
* **Knowledge of Anatomy:** They understand the structures under the skin to avoid damaging nerves, blood vessels, or other important tissues.
* **Experience:** They are trained to identify different types of cysts and choose the most appropriate and effective treatment method, ensuring the best possible outcome and reducing the risk of recurrence.
* **Infection Control:** They can prescribe antibiotics if necessary and manage any post-procedure complications.
