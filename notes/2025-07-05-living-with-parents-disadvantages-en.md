Living with parents in your 20s or 30s can have several disadvantages:

1. **Limited Independence**: You may feel restricted in making personal choices, like decorating, hosting guests, or setting your own schedule, due to parental oversight or house rules.

2. **Stunted Personal Growth**: Relying on parents for housing or financial support can delay developing life skills like budgeting, home maintenance, or navigating adulthood independently.

3. **Social Stigma**: Society may perceive living with parents as a lack of ambition or success, potentially impacting self-esteem or how others view you.

4. **Privacy Issues**: Parents may inadvertently or intentionally intrude on your personal space, relationships, or decisions, limiting your sense of autonomy.

5. **Relationship Strain**: Constant proximity can lead to conflicts over lifestyle differences, expectations, or generational gaps, potentially harming family dynamics.

6. **Delayed Milestones**: Living at home may slow down achieving milestones like homeownership, marriage, or starting a family, as you may prioritize comfort over taking risks.

7. **Career Limitations**: You might feel less motivated to pursue opportunities requiring relocation or financial independence, potentially stalling career growth.

8. **Household Responsibilities**: You may be expected to contribute to chores or family obligations, which can feel burdensome if they conflict with personal goals or schedules.

These factors vary depending on cultural norms, family dynamics, and personal circumstances.
