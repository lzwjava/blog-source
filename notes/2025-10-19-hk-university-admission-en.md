Yes, as a mainland Chinese citizen pursuing an Associate Degree in Computer Application through self-study at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies (GDUFS), you can apply to enroll in a Hong Kong public university for a full undergraduate bachelor's degree via the non-JUPAS route. This is similar in outcome to Joshua Wong's enrollment (a full degree program), but your path differs as a non-local applicant with post-secondary qualifications rather than a local high school leaver. GDUFS is a recognized institution in China, and its self-study programs (often via the National Higher Education Self-Study Examination, or Zikao) lead to valid associate degrees that qualify as post-secondary credentials for HK admissions.

### Eligibility and Key Differences from Gaokao/Local Routes
- **Your Qualification Fits Non-JUPAS Post-Secondary Category**: HK public universities (e.g., HKU, CUHK, HKUST, CityU, PolyU, HKBU, EdUHK) accept associate degrees or equivalent from recognized Chinese institutions for non-JUPAS Year 1 entry (full 4-year bachelor's) or senior-year entry (advanced standing, shortening to 2–3 years). Since you've started in Oct 2022 and passed 9 Zikao courses (covering core computing/math subjects like Data Structures, Advanced Programming, Database, and Computer Organization), you meet the "at least one year of study toward an associate degree" threshold for most unis. Completing the degree strengthens your case but isn't always required for application.
- **Zikao-Specific Notes**: Standalone Zikao results (without university affiliation) are rarely accepted for direct undergrad entry, as they're seen as non-standard high school equivalents. However, your GDUFS-enrolled program validates them as part of a formal associate degree, making it equivalent to other Chinese sub-degrees. Unis evaluate on a case-by-case basis, focusing on your transcript, passed courses, and relevance to the target program (e.g., computer science/engineering).
- **Non-Local Status**: You'll pay international fees (HK$145,000–HK$182,000/year) and count toward the ~40% non-local quota. No Gaokao needed—your self-study progress substitutes.

### Application Process for 2026/27 Intake (Deadlines Approaching)
Apply directly to each university (no central system like JUPAS). Main round: Nov 2025–Feb 2026; early round: Sep–Oct 2025. As of Oct 19, 2025, prepare now.
1. **Choose Unis/Programs**: Target computing-related (e.g., BSc Computer Science at HKU/CUHK, BEng Computing at CityU). Check if advanced standing applies (e.g., credit for your passed courses like Data Structures/Database).
2. **Required Documents**:
   - GDUFS transcript showing passed Zikao courses (9 completed + prep for 7 more; highlight computing ones).
   - Proof of enrollment/progress toward associate degree.
   - English proficiency (IELTS 6.0+ or TOEFL 80+; waived if English-taught Zikao courses).
   - Personal statement, references, extracurriculars (emphasize self-motivation).
   - If incomplete degree, explain in application.
3. **Selection**: Holistic—GPA equivalent (aim for 3.0+/4.0 from courses), interview (online for non-locals), no entrance exam. Acceptance rates: 10–20% for non-JUPAS post-secondary.
4. **Visa**: Student visa upon offer; post-grad IANG for work stay.

### Comparison to Joshua Wong's Path

| Aspect                  | Joshua Wong (Local, 2014)          | Your Self-Study Path (Non-Local)                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Entry Level**        | Year 1 (fresh high school)        | Year 1 or senior year (post-secondary credits)   |
| **Qualification**      | HKDSE via JUPAS                   | GDUFS Associate (Zikao-based) via non-JUPAS      |
| **Fees**               | Local subsidized (~HK$42k/year)   | International (~HK$145k+/year)                   |
| **Duration to Degree** | 4 years                           | 4 years (Year 1) or 2–3 years (advanced)         |
| **Competitiveness**    | High (local quota)                | High (quota + holistic review)                   |

### Tips and Scholarships
- **Strengthen Profile**: Finish more Zikao courses (e.g., Networks, Linear Algebra) before applying—relevance to CS programs helps. Add projects/portfolio from self-study.
- **Scholarships**: Apply for Entrance Scholarships (up to full tuition + stipend) at HKU/CUHK for strong academics; Belt & Road Scholarship for mainlanders (covers fees/living).
- **Challenges**: Political climate hasn't restricted academic admissions; focus on merit. If rejected, consider HK's self-financed programs or top-up bachelor's.
