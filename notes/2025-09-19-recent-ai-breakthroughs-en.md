Here’s a summary of some of the **biggest AI developments** over roughly the past two years (2023-2025). If you want, I can pull together more by domain (e.g. healthcare, robotics, climate).

---

## Key Trends & Statistics

* Global/private investment in AI remains strong. In 2024, generative AI got \~\$34B in private investment, up \~19% from 2023. ([Stanford HAI][1])
* More organisations are using AI: about 78% of organisations reported using AI in 2024 vs 55% a year before. ([Stanford HAI][1])
* Benchmarks in image recognition, speech recognition, and language understanding have largely reached human-level (or very close) in many settings. ([Carnegie Endowment][2])

## Major Technical Breakthroughs

1. **Improved Reasoning / Mathematics in LLMs**

   * Google’s models like *AlphaProof* and *AlphaGeometry 2* made progress on complex math problems, including some from the International Math Olympiad. ([Reuters][3])
   * Models are being designed to not just predict text, but *think*, i.e. plan, verify, handle logic more cleanly. Gemini 2.5 (from Google/DeepMind) is one example. ([blog.google][4])

2. **Multimodal & Generative Models**

   * Increasing capability in cross-modal tasks: text ↔ image ↔ video ↔ audio. For example, Google’s “Veo” video generation tools, models that can generate audio and visual together. ([blog.google][4])
   * Generative models being used more broadly, not just for novelty but practical content creation, design, etc. ([Forbes][5])

3. **Protein Design & Science**

   * Continued advances in protein structure prediction (AlphaFold etc.), and related work being elegant/impactful enough to win Nobel prizes. ([AP News][6])
   * AI helping with molecular interactions, biology, chemistry problems. ([Wikipedia][7])

4. **Quantum Computing Chips & Hardware**

   * Google’s “Willow” quantum chip: a 105-qubit processor with quantum error correction below threshold; claimed to do some tasks that are essentially impossible for classical supercomputers. ([The Verge][8])
   * More effort globally toward self-reliance in AI hardware (e.g. chips, memory architectures). For instance Huawei’s plans for higher-end AI chips and compute platforms. ([Reuters][9])

5. **AI in Science & Research Productivity**

   * Scientists using AI tools have higher publication rates, more citations, become leaders sooner. ([arXiv][10])
   * But there’s concern that AI tends to focus attention on established/data-rich topics, reducing scientific diversity. ([arXiv][10])

6. **Coding & Problem Solving**

   * AI systems are getting better at solving programming and abstract algorithm problems, in some cases outperforming humans in specific competitions. Example: Google/DeepMind’s AI at ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) solved difficult problems that many human teams couldn’t. ([Financial Times][11])

7. **Robotics & Physical Interaction**

   * More emphasis on robotics, agents that interact with the physical world, simulation + teleoperation, improving learning in real/world environments. OpenAI is ramping up efforts here. ([WIRED][12])

## Challenges & Risks Being Addressed

* **Safety, alignment, ethics**: As models grow stronger, concerns are growing about how to ensure alignment, avoid misuse, bias, hallucination, etc.
* **Compute cost & energy usage**: Large models consume massive resources; efficiency, hardware improvements, and environmental footprint are active areas of concern.
* **Benchmark saturation & evaluation**: Benchmarks are sometimes no longer meaningful differentiators because many models already do extremely well. ([Carnegie Endowment][2])
* **Governance & geopolitics**: Nations/companies pushing for dominance in AI tech, chips, compute. Hardware and supply chain security are areas of strategic competition. ([Reuters][9])
