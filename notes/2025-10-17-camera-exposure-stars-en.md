### What is Exposure in a Camera?

Exposure in photography refers to the total amount of light that reaches the camera's sensor (or film in older cameras) over a specific period of time. It determines how bright or dark your photo turns out—if there's too little light, the image is underexposed (too dark); too much light, and it's overexposed (washed out or blown out highlights).

Exposure is controlled by three main factors, often called the "exposure triangle":
- **Shutter speed**: How long the camera's shutter stays open to let light in (e.g., 1/1000th of a second for fast action, or several seconds for low light).
- **Aperture**: The size of the lens opening (measured in f-stops, like f/2.8 for wide open, letting in more light).
- **ISO**: The sensor's sensitivity to light (lower ISO like 100 for bright conditions, higher like 3200 for dim scenes, but higher ISO adds noise/grain).

In simple terms, exposure is like deciding how much "sunlight" pours into a room through a window—you adjust the window size, how long you leave it open, and how sensitive the room's walls are to light.

### How Exposure Relates to NASA Space Photos (and Why You Can't See Stars)

NASA space photos—like those from the Apollo missions, the International Space Station (ISS), or Hubble—often show a pitch-black sky with no stars, even though astronauts *can* see them with the naked eye in space. This isn't a conspiracy or fake; it's pure optics and exposure at work.

Here's why:
- **Bright subjects dominate the scene**: Space photos usually capture sunlit objects like Earth, the Moon's surface, spacecraft, or astronauts in sunlight. These are *extremely* bright compared to stars. Stars are incredibly faint points of light, trillions of times dimmer than the sunlit foreground.
- **Short exposures for bright light**: To avoid overexposing (blowing out) the bright areas into featureless white blobs, cameras use very fast shutter speeds (e.g., 1/250th second or faster) and smaller apertures. This lets in just enough light for the main subject but not enough time for faint starlight to register on the sensor. It's like trying to photograph a lit birthday candle in a dark room—if you expose for the flame, the room stays black.
- **Result: Stars vanish**: With short exposures, the camera's sensor doesn't accumulate enough photons from distant stars. To capture stars, you'd need long exposures (seconds or minutes), but that would turn the sunlit parts into blurry white streaks or total overexposure.

In reality, stars *are* there—you just need different settings. NASA does take star photos with telescopes or long-exposure cameras (e.g., Hubble's deep-field images show millions of galaxies). But for "everyday" space snapshots of astronauts or Earthrise, the exposure prioritizes the visible action.

### Low Exposure and "Dark Places" in a Spaceship

Your point about not seeing dark places in a "fly ship" (I assume you mean spaceship or aircraft) ties right in. In low-light conditions inside a spacecraft:
- **Exposure mismatch**: Interior lights (like LEDs on the ISS) are set for human eyes or cameras tuned to average brightness. Shadows or unlit corners get underexposed because the camera/shutter prioritizes the lit areas to avoid glare from screens or windows.
- **Similar to space views**: Looking out a spaceship window toward a dark region (e.g., Earth's night side) with low exposure means you can't see faint details—like distant mountains or cities—because the camera is set for the brighter cabin or sunlit exterior. It's the same principle: low light accumulation in short exposures hides the dim stuff.

Astronauts often use flashlights or adjust settings to "see" those dark spots, just like you'd use night mode on your phone camera.

### Optical Principles at Play: How Cameras Capture These Pictures

The core optics here boil down to **light intensity, dynamic range, and photon collection**:
- **Light intensity and the inverse square law**: Light from nearby bright sources (sun on a spacesuit) falls off slowly, overwhelming the sensor. Starlight, from billions of light-years away, is so weak that it follows the inverse square law harshly—by the time it reaches us, it's a trickle of photons.
- **Dynamic range limits**: Camera sensors (even advanced NASA ones like Hasselblad or Nikon mods) have a limited "dynamic range"—the span between the darkest shadow and brightest highlight they can capture in one shot. Human eyes adapt dynamically (pupils dilate), but cameras don't; they lock in one exposure. Space scenes have *huge* contrast (bright sun vs. faint stars), so something has to give—usually the stars.
- **How the camera "gets" the picture**: Light passes through the lens (which focuses it like a magnifying glass), hits the shutter (a fast curtain), and exposes the sensor (a grid of light-sensitive pixels). Each pixel counts incoming photons to build color and brightness data. For clear NASA pics:
  - Lenses are wide-angle or telephoto, optimized for vacuum (no air distortion).
  - Post-processing (like HDR blending multiple exposures) can add stars later, but raw shots prioritize clarity of the subject.
  - In telescopes like Hubble, cooled sensors and long exposures (hours) collect faint light without noise.

If you want stars in space photos, switch to astrophotography mode: tripod, long shutter (e.g., 30 seconds), low ISO, wide aperture. NASA's crew even does this for fun on the ISS!
