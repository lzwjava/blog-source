Rust is indeed a popular choice for startups, especially those building infrastructure, data-intensive systems, and other performance-critical applications. The same advantages that attract big tech (memory safety, performance, concurrency) are often even more critical for startups where efficiency and reliability can directly impact their ability to scale and compete.

Here's a closer look at Rust in the startup ecosystem, specifically touching on your examples:

**1. TiKV (PingCAP)**
* **Core of TiDB:** TiKV is a prime example of Rust in a production-grade distributed database. It's the distributed transactional key-value database that serves as the storage layer for TiDB, a distributed SQL database.
* **Reasons for Rust:** PingCAP (the company behind TiDB and TiKV) explicitly chose Rust for TiKV due to:
    * **Memory safety:** Crucial for a robust and stable database that needs to run for extended periods without crashes.
    * **High performance:** Essential for a distributed database handling high throughput and low latency.
    * **Modern tooling (Cargo):** Rust's build system and package manager greatly simplify development and dependency management.
    * **Concurrency:** Rust's ownership and borrowing system helps write safe concurrent code, which is vital for distributed systems.
* **Impact:** TiKV's success has been a significant showcase for Rust's capabilities in building complex, high-performance distributed systems.

**2. GreptimeDB (GreptimeTeam)**
* **Time-Series Database:** GreptimeDB is a modern, open-source time-series database designed for metrics, logs, and events, built with Rust.
* **Edge Computing Focus:** They're even pushing it to edge environments like Android, demonstrating Rust's versatility for low-resource and embedded scenarios.
* **Why Rust for Time-Series:** Time-series data often involves high ingest rates and complex queries, demanding:
    * **High performance:** To handle massive volumes of data efficiently.
    * **Memory efficiency:** To manage large datasets without excessive resource consumption.
    * **Reliability:** For critical monitoring and logging data. Rust excels in these areas.

**Beyond TiKV and GreptimeDB, here are general trends and other examples of startups using Rust:**

* **Databases and Data Infrastructure:** This is a huge area for Rust in startups. Besides the ones you mentioned:
    * **SurrealDB:** A multi-model database (document, graph, key-value, etc.) written entirely in Rust.
    * **Quickwit:** A search engine built in Rust, aiming to be an alternative to Elasticsearch.
    * **RisingWave:** A streaming processing engine, another data infrastructure project in Rust.
    * **Vector (from DataDog):** A high-performance observability data router, written in Rust.
    * **Qdrant DB:** A vector similarity search engine, also using Rust.
    * **LanceDB:** A developer-friendly database for multimodal AI, powered by Rust.
    * **ParadeDB:** Postgres for search and analytics.
    * **Glaredb:** An analytics DBMS for distributed data.

* **Web3 and Blockchain:** Rust is arguably the dominant language in the blockchain space due to its security, performance, and control over low-level details. Many blockchain startups are built on Rust:
    * **Solana:** A high-performance blockchain.
    * **Polkadot:** A multi-chain framework.
    * **Near Protocol:** Another sharded, scalable blockchain.
    * **Various dApp and smart contract development platforms.**

* **Developer Tools & Infrastructure:**
    * **Deno:** A secure JavaScript/TypeScript runtime (alternative to Node.js) built with Rust and Tokio.
    * **SWC:** A super-fast TypeScript/JavaScript compiler, used by many build tools.
    * **Turborepo (Vercel):** A high-performance build system for monorepos, partially written in Rust.
    * **biome:** A toolchain for web projects, aiming to unify formatting, linting, and more.
    * **Shuttle:** A serverless platform built in Rust.

* **Performance-Critical Backend Services:** Startups dealing with high traffic, low latency requirements, or complex computations often turn to Rust.

**Challenges for Startups Adopting Rust:**

While the benefits are clear, startups also face some unique challenges with Rust:

* **Steep Learning Curve:** As mentioned in one of the search results, Rust has a steeper learning curve than many other popular languages (Python, Go, JavaScript). This can slow down initial development and make it harder to find experienced Rust developers quickly.
* **Hiring:** While Rust's popularity is growing, the pool of experienced Rust developers is still smaller compared to languages like Python or JavaScript. This can be a significant hurdle for rapidly scaling teams.
* **Maturity of Ecosystem (compared to older languages):** While rapidly maturing, some libraries and frameworks might not be as feature-rich or battle-tested as those in more established ecosystems, requiring more "roll-your-own" solutions or contributing to open-source projects.

**Overall:**

Rust is a strong contender for startups building foundational technologies where performance, safety, and reliability are paramount. Companies like TiKV and GreptimeDB demonstrate that it's possible to build highly successful and innovative products with Rust, even at the startup stage. The growing community, robust tooling, and increasing adoption by big tech further solidify Rust's position as a valuable language for ambitious startup projects.
