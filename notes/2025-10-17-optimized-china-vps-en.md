### CN2 GIA/CTGNet VPS Overview

This webpage from Bandwagon Host promotes their CN2 GIA/CTGNet VPS, a virtual private server optimized for high-quality, stable internet connections to and from China. It's designed to tackle common issues like network congestion, high packet loss, and unreliable service when targeting Chinese users. Ideal for web content delivery, video conferences, VoIP, online gaming, and business links to mainland China.

The service leverages premium China Telecom networks—CN2 GIA (AS4809) and CTGNet (AS23764)—which offer the lowest congestion and best performance compared to cheaper options like ChinaNet (AS4134) or CN2 GT. These networks are more expensive but provide superior stability, especially during peak hours.

#### Key Locations and Infrastructure
- **Los Angeles (Recommended for Cost-Effectiveness)**: Available in two datacenters (USCA_6 and USCA_9), each with 8 x 10 Gbps CN2 GIA/CTGNet links. Includes direct peering with Google and local LA carriers.
  - **USCA_6**: Top choice for overall capacity and stability. All outbound China traffic routes via CN2 GIA (covers China Unicom and Mobile too). Inbound from China Mobile has slightly higher latency due to no direct peering.
  - **USCA_9**: Better for direct inbound from China Mobile. Outbound goes straight to China Telecom (no local LA peering), which optimizes routes to certain destinations like universities. Non-China traffic routes through China Telecom first.
  - **Migration**: Easy switch between datacenters without data loss.
- **Hong Kong and Japan**: Also supported but significantly more expensive. LA is suggested unless ultra-low latency is essential.

#### Features and Benefits
- **Superior Routing**: Optimized for China Telecom paths; notes on peering limits (e.g., no China Telecom peering with Unicom/Mobile since 2019).
- **DDoS Protection**: Relies on IP nullrouting during attacks—less robust than high-capacity networks like ChinaNet due to limited bandwidth.
- **Use Cases**: Perfect for low-latency needs in China-facing apps, avoiding 30%+ packet loss on standard transits.
- **Network Context**: Explains China's three main carriers (Telecom/CT dominant), with CN2 GIA/CTGNet as the priciest tier for minimal issues.

#### Technical Specs
- **Networks**:
  - CN2 GIA: Premium, costly (~$120/Mbps), limited capacity—best for sensitive traffic.
  - CTGNet: Newer equivalent to CN2 GIA in quality and price.
- **Comparisons**:
  | Network | Cost | Capacity | Congestion/Packet Loss | Best For |
  |---------|------|----------|------------------------|----------|
  | CN2 GIA/CTGNet | High | Limited | Low | Stability (VoIP, gaming) |
  | CN2 GT | Medium | Medium | High (pre-2021) | General use |
  | ChinaNet | Low | High | High during peaks | DDoS tolerance |

No specific VPS hardware specs (e.g., CPU/RAM) are detailed—focus is on networking.

#### Pricing, Payments, and Promotions
The page doesn't list explicit VPS pricing plans, but notes CN2 GIA's high transit costs and that HK/Japan options are pricier than LA. Orders link to a cart, but no details on tiers or totals. No payment methods or promotions mentioned. General terms highlight DDoS limitations and capacity constraints.
