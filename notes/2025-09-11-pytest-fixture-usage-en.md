## What is `@pytest.fixture`?

`@pytest.fixture` is a decorator that marks a function as a **fixture** - a special function that provides test data, setup, or teardown functionality to your tests. Fixtures are one of pytest's most powerful features and a key reason why many developers prefer pytest over Python's built-in `unittest` module.

## How Fixtures Work

Fixtures follow a simple but powerful pattern:

1. **Setup**: The code before the `yield` statement runs before the test
2. **Test Execution**: The test runs when it reaches the `yield` statement
3. **Teardown**: The code after the `yield` statement runs after the test completes

### Basic Fixture Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    # Setup code
    data = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
    yield data  # Test runs here
    # Teardown code (runs after test)
    print("Cleaning up sample data")
```

## Why We Need Fixtures

Fixtures solve several common testing problems:

1. **Test Isolation**: Ensure each test runs with fresh, predictable data
2. **Code Reuse**: Avoid repeating setup/teardown code across multiple tests
3. **Resource Management**: Properly handle resources like database connections, files, or network connections
4. **Test Clarity**: Keep test functions focused on what they're testing, not on setup
5. **Dependency Injection**: Provide exactly what each test needs

## Key Features of Fixtures

### 1. Dependency Injection

Fixtures can depend on other fixtures, creating a dependency graph:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def database_connection():
    # Setup database connection
    conn = create_connection()
    yield conn
    conn.close()

@pytest.fixture
def user_table(database_connection):
    # Uses the database_connection fixture
    create_table(database_connection, "users")
    yield
    drop_table(database_connection, "users")
```

### 2. Scope Control

Fixtures can have different lifetimes:

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")  # Default - runs once per test
def per_test_fixture():
    pass

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")  # Runs once per module
def per_module_fixture():
    pass

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")  # Runs once per test session
def per_session_fixture():
    pass
```

### 3. Autouse Fixtures

Fixtures can run automatically without being requested:

```python
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def always_run_this():
    # This runs before every test in the module
    yield
    # This runs after every test
```

### 4. Parametrized Fixtures

Fixtures can generate multiple sets of data:

```python
@pytest.fixture(params=[1, 2, 3])
def number(request):
    return request.param  # Will run tests with 1, 2, and 3
```

## Practical Example with API Testing

Here's how fixtures help with your financial header testing scenario:

```python
import pytest
import requests

@pytest.fixture
def financial_header():
    # Setup - create header
    headers = create_financial_header()  # Your creation logic
    yield headers  # Test runs here with these headers

    # Teardown - delete header
    delete_financial_header(headers)  # Your cleanup logic

def test_submit_transaction(financial_header):
    # The fixture provides the headers automatically
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.example.com/transactions",
        headers=financial_header,
        json={"amount": 100}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201

def test_validate_header(financial_header):
    # Same fixture used in another test
    response = requests.get(
        "https://api.example.com/validate",
        headers=financial_header
    )
    assert response.json()["valid"] is True
```

## Comparison with unittest

| Feature               | pytest Fixtures                     | unittest setUp/tearDown          |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Dependency injection  | ✅ Yes                              | ❌ No                             |
| Scope control         | ✅ Function, class, module, session | ❌ Only method/class level       |
| Clean syntax          | ✅ Simple decorator                 | ❌ Requires inheritance           |
| Test isolation        | ✅ Each test gets fresh fixtures    | ❌ Shared state can cause issues  |
| Parametrization       | ✅ Built-in support                 | ❌ Manual implementation needed  |

## When to Use Fixtures

Use fixtures when you need to:
- Set up test data or objects
- Manage external resources (DB connections, files, etc.)
- Perform cleanup after tests
- Share common test dependencies
- Create different test environments
- Implement complex setup/teardown logic

Fixtures are particularly valuable in API testing (like your financial header case) because they help manage the lifecycle of test resources cleanly and predictably.
