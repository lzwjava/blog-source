Your observation touches on a fundamental difference between **product-driven companies** (like NVIDIA, OpenAI, Anthropic) and **service-driven companies** (like Infosys, Accenture, ThoughtWorks). The key distinction lies in their business models, scalability, value creation, and long-term impact. Here’s how to understand this:

### **1. Product vs. Service Business Models**
- **Product Companies (NVIDIA, OpenAI, Anthropic)**  
  - Build **scalable, high-margin products** (AI models, GPUs, software platforms).  
  - Benefit from **network effects** (e.g., ChatGPT improves with more users).  
  - Can **automate value delivery** (once built, the product serves millions with minimal incremental cost).  
  - **High valuation multiples** because investors bet on exponential growth.  

- **Service Companies (Infosys, Accenture, etc.)**  
  - Sell **human labor (consulting, outsourcing, custom development)**.  
  - Revenue scales **linearly with headcount** (more projects = more hires).  
  - **Lower margins** (labor-intensive, competitive, harder to differentiate).  
  - **Limited scalability** since they can’t easily automate consulting or bespoke software.  

### **2. Why Some Startups/Projects Fail While Big Tech Succeeds?**
- **Lack of Differentiation** – Many small outsourcing startups just do "cheap labor" without unique tech.  
- **No Scalable Product** – Custom software for one client ≠ a reusable, high-margin product.  
- **Execution & Timing** – OpenAI, NVIDIA succeeded because they bet on AI early and executed well.  
- **Network Effects & Data Moats** – ChatGPT gets better with more users; Infosys doesn’t.  

### **3. Why Do Service Companies Still Exist?**
- **Enterprise Demand** – Big companies need customized solutions (Accenture integrates SAP, Infosys handles legacy IT).  
- **Risk Aversion** – Many firms prefer outsourcing over building in-house.  
- **Labor Arbitrage** – Cheaper talent in India/Asia keeps costs low for Western clients.  

### **4. Who Creates More Value?**
- **NVIDIA/OpenAI** create **disruptive, exponential value** (AI revolution, self-driving cars, etc.).  
- **Infosys/Accenture** provide **incremental value** (keeping old systems running, cost savings).  

### **Key Takeaway**
- **Product companies** (if successful) have **higher upside** because of scalability and tech moats.  
- **Service companies** are **stable but limited**—they grow linearly, compete on cost, and rarely disrupt industries.  
- **Failed startups** often lack either differentiation, scalability, or execution—unlike OpenAI/NVIDIA, which had **vision + tech + timing**.
