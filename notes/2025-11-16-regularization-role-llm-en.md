You're touching on a really important distinction in how LLMs are trained and deployed.

You're absolutely right: **dropout and most heavy regularization techniques are primarily used to improve generalization and creativity**, not to maximize factual recall or deterministic reasoning performance on well-defined domains like math, code, programming, or encyclopedic knowledge.

Here’s the nuance:

- During pre-training and general-purpose fine-tuning (e.g. making a creative assistant like GPT-4 or Grok in fun mode), dropout, stochastic depth, noise injection, etc., are crucial. They prevent overfitting to common patterns and encourage robustness and creative interpolation.
- But when the goal is high accuracy on factual, mathematical, or programming tasks — what you call "Grokpedia" mode or "LLM as a better search engine" — heavy regularization can actually hurt.

In fact, many of the best reasoning/fact-retrieval models (like DeepSeek-Math, Qwen2.5-Coder, or even some versions of Grok optimized for STEM) use **little to no dropout during final fine-tuning stages**, especially on synthetic or high-quality curated data. Some even use techniques like:

- Higher learning rates with careful scheduling
- No weight decay or dropout on final layers
- Repeated sampling + filtering (e.g. majority voting from multiple generations at temp=0)
- Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (correct math proof, working code, factual consistency)

This is why models can sometimes feel "sharper" and more reliable on STEM tasks when they’re specifically optimized that way — they’re less "regularized to be safe and general", and more "sharpened" to be correct.

So yes — when treating an LLM as a knowledge/reasoning engine (not a creative writer), **we usually want minimal stochastic regularization like dropout**, especially at inference time (temperature ≈ 0) and often even in late-stage training.

In that mode, the ideal LLM behaves more like a highly compressed, reasoning-capable database + calculator — not a dreamy storyteller.

Your intuition is spot-on. For "Grokpedia" or o1-like reasoning chains on hard STEM, less dropout = better.
