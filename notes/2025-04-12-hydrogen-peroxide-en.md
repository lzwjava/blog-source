Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is a colorless liquid chemical compound with a slightly pungent odor. It is a common household chemical and has various industrial and medicinal uses.

**Chemical Properties:**

* **Molecular Structure:** It consists of two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms bonded together. The oxygen atoms are linked by a single bond, and each oxygen atom is also bonded to a hydrogen atom.
* **Oxidizing Agent:** Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful oxidizing agent, meaning it readily donates oxygen atoms to other substances. This property is responsible for many of its uses, such as bleaching and disinfection.
* **Decomposition:** It is unstable and readily decomposes into water (H₂O) and oxygen gas (O₂) especially in the presence of catalysts like metals, metal ions, or light. This decomposition releases heat.
* **Acidic Nature:** It is a weak acid.
* **Solubility:** It is miscible with water, alcohol, and ether.

**Common Uses:**

* **Antiseptic:** It is used as a mild antiseptic to clean minor cuts, scrapes, and burns to prevent infection.
* **Mouthwash:** It can be used as a mouth rinse to help remove mucus and relieve minor mouth irritation.
* **Teeth Whitening:** It is an active ingredient in many over-the-counter and professional teeth whitening products.
* **Hair Bleaching/Lightening:** It is used to lighten hair color.
* **Cleaning and Disinfecting:** It is used as a household cleaner and disinfectant for surfaces, laundry, and even food.
* **Stain Removal:** It can effectively remove various stains like blood, wine, and grass.
* **Industrial Uses:** In higher concentrations, it is used as a bleaching agent for textiles and paper pulp, in chemical manufacturing, wastewater treatment, and even as a rocket propellant.

**Safety Precautions:**

* Concentrated hydrogen peroxide can be corrosive and cause burns to the skin and eyes.
* Ingestion of high concentrations can be dangerous.
* It should be stored in a cool, dark place away from heat and incompatible materials to prevent decomposition.
* Always follow the instructions and safety guidelines on the product label.

Concentrated hydrogen peroxide's corrosiveness depends on its concentration, with higher concentrations posing greater risks. Here's a breakdown based on available information:

- **3% Hydrogen Peroxide**: Commonly used for household and medical purposes, this concentration is generally considered safe and non-corrosive to skin and eyes with brief exposure. It may cause mild irritation in sensitive individuals or with prolonged contact, but it typically does not cause burns or significant tissue damage.

- **25% Hydrogen Peroxide**: At this concentration, hydrogen peroxide is significantly more hazardous. It is classified as corrosive and can cause burns to the skin and eyes upon contact. According to safety guidelines, concentrations above 8% are generally considered corrosive, with the potential for chemical burns, severe irritation, and tissue damage increasing with concentration. A 25% solution would likely cause immediate irritation, redness, and potentially blistering or burns to skin and severe damage to eyes, including corneal burns, if not promptly flushed.

- **Higher Concentrations (e.g., 35% or above)**: These are even more dangerous, often used industrially or in specialized applications (e.g., food-grade or laboratory settings). They can cause severe burns, whitening of the skin, and permanent eye damage without immediate intervention. Concentrations above 20% are explicitly labeled as corrosive in safety data sheets (SDS), requiring protective equipment like gloves and goggles.

**Key Factors**:
- **Exposure Time**: Even lower concentrations can cause irritation with prolonged exposure, while brief exposure to higher concentrations (like 25%) can cause immediate damage.
- **First Aid**: For exposure to concentrations like 25%, immediate flushing with water for at least 15 minutes is critical, followed by medical attention, especially for eye contact.
- **Safety Thresholds**: The transition from irritant to corrosive typically occurs around 8-10% for skin and eyes, with 25% firmly in the corrosive range.

**Conclusion**: A 3% solution is unlikely to cause burns under normal use, though it may irritate. A 25% solution is corrosive and can cause burns to skin and eyes, requiring careful handling and protective measures. Always consult safety data sheets and wear appropriate PPE when handling concentrations above 10%.
