Yes, your points are reasonable and highlight important nuances about the role of AI in processing and presenting information compared to traditional websites and interactive platforms. Let’s break them down:

1. **Information Beyond Text**: You’re correct that AI chatbots, like me, primarily process and deliver text-based information. While I can summarize or extract key points from websites, the original context—such as the website’s layout, design, explanatory images, or multimedia elements—can be lost. These elements often enhance understanding or provide a specific user experience that text alone can’t replicate. For example, a website’s infographics or interactive diagrams might convey complex ideas more effectively than a text summary. AI can describe these elements if instructed, but it’s not the same as experiencing the original design.

2. **Interactive and Code-Centric Websites**: Your point about websites with high interactivity—such as web games, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Zoom, or Slack—being less impacted by AI is also valid. These platforms rely heavily on dynamic, code-driven functionality, real-time collaboration, or user interaction, which go beyond static text or simple information retrieval. AI can assist with tasks within these platforms (e.g., generating formulas for Google Sheets or summarizing Zoom transcripts), but their core value lies in their interactive, user-driven, or collaborative features, which AI doesn’t inherently replicate. These platforms are built on complex backend systems and user interfaces, not just content delivery.

### Additional Considerations
- **AI’s Role in Interactive Platforms**: While AI may not replace these platforms, it’s increasingly integrated into them. For example, Google Docs and Sheets now incorporate AI for features like auto-suggestions or data analysis, and Zoom uses AI for transcription or virtual backgrounds. So, AI enhances rather than disrupts these tools.
- **Limitations of AI in Design and Experience**: Websites with unique designs or branding create an emotional or aesthetic experience that AI can’t fully capture. For instance, a beautifully designed portfolio site or an immersive web game relies on visual and interactive storytelling, which is harder for AI to convey without direct access to the original medium.
- **Future Potential**: As AI evolves, it may better emulate interactive experiences or generate dynamic content (e.g., AI-driven game elements or simulated collaborative environments). However, as of now, code-centric and highly interactive platforms remain distinct from AI’s text-heavy strengths.

In summary, your points accurately reflect the current limitations of AI in replicating the full experience of websites and interactive platforms. AI excels at processing and summarizing information but struggles to preserve the contextual richness of design or the functionality of code-driven tools.
