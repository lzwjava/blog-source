title: Fix Python Not Found Errors Easily
translated: false
---

Yes — the `"python not found"` error happens because your login shell might not have the same `PATH` environment as the interactive shell where you normally type `python`. When you call `subprocess.run(..., shell=True)`, the subshell might not see `python` if it’s not on `$PATH` or if your system only has `python3`.

Here are reliable ways to fix it:

---

### 1. Use `sys.executable`

Instead of relying on `python` being found, always call the currently running Python interpreter:

```python
import os
import subprocess
import platform
import sys

def gpa():
    python_exec = sys.executable  # full path to current Python interpreter

    system = platform.system()
    if system == "Linux":
        shell_command = f"bash -l -c '{python_exec} ~/bin/gitmessageai.py --api deepseek --allow-pull-push'"
    elif system == "Darwin":
        shell_command = f"zsh -l -c '{python_exec} ~/bin/gitmessageai.py --api deepseek --allow-pull-push'"
    else:  # Windows
        shell_command = f'cmd.exe /c "{python_exec} %USERPROFILE%\\bin\\gitmessageai.py --api deepseek --allow-pull-push"'

    subprocess.run(shell_command, shell=True)
```

This guarantees that the same Python you used to run your script will also run `gitmessageai.py`.

---

### 2. Try both `python` and `python3`

Some systems only have `python3`. You can detect availability:

```python
import shutil

python_exec = shutil.which("python") or shutil.which("python3")
```

Then substitute that into your command string.

---

### 3. Hardcode a known path

If you know the absolute path (e.g. `/usr/bin/python3` or `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`), you can directly use it in your command.

---

👉 The most robust solution is **Option 1 (`sys.executable`)**, since it uses the interpreter already running your script. That way you never depend on `$PATH`.

Do you want me to refactor your function with `sys.executable` fully integrated so you don’t ever see the `"python not found"` error again?
