Based on your busy schedule in Guangzhou and preference for easy-to-prepare steamed foods like buns (baozi) or dumplings (jiaozi), JD.com is a great platform for frozen or pre-made options that just need hot water steaming—no fancy equipment required (a basic steamer basket or even a pot with a rack works). You can search for these under categories like "速冻食品" (frozen foods) or "饺子/包子" (dumplings/buns). Delivery is fast in Guangzhou, often same-day or next-day.

Here are some similar quick choices you can buy and steam in 10-15 minutes:

### 1. **Frozen Steamed Buns (Baozi) Variations**
   - **What to buy**: Pre-filled baozi like pork & cabbage, beef & onion, or vegetarian (e.g., mushroom or lotus paste). Brands like "三全" (Sanquan) or "湾仔码头" (Wanzai Matou) are popular and widely available on JD.com. Prices around 15-30 RMB per pack of 6-12 pieces.
   - **How to cook**: Boil water in a pot, place buns in a steamer basket over the boiling water (don't submerge), cover, and steam for 8-12 minutes until fluffy. Add to rice or eat with soy sauce/vinegar dip.
   - **Why it fits**: Just like your buns—minimal prep, filling meal.

### 2. **Frozen Dumplings or Wontons (Jiaozi or Huntun)**
   - **What to buy**: Pork, shrimp, or veggie dumplings. Look for "水饺" (boiled/steamed dumplings) or "馄饨皮" (wonton wrappers with filling). Sanquan or "狗不理" (Goubuli) brands are reliable. Packs cost 20-40 RMB for 20-30 pieces.
   - **How to cook**: Same steaming method: 10 minutes over boiling water. For wontons, they cook faster (5-8 min) and can be lighter.
   - **Why it fits**: Super similar to dumplings; add chili oil for flavor.

### 3. **Steamed Rice Rolls or Rice Noodle Sheets (Cheung Fun)**
   - **What to buy**: Frozen pre-rolled rice noodle sheets with fillings like beef or shrimp ("肠粉" on JD.com). Brands like "味好美" (Meihao Mei) or generic frozen dim sum packs. About 15-25 RMB per serving.
   - **How to cook**: Steam directly for 5-10 minutes until soft. Drizzle with soy sauce and sesame oil.
   - **Why it fits**: Guangzhou specialty (Cantonese style), light and quick—feels homemade without effort.

### 4. **Fish or Meat Balls (Yudan or Rouwan)**
   - **What to buy**: Frozen fish balls, beef balls, or crab sticks ("鱼丸" or "牛肉丸"). Popular from "海底捞" (Haidilao) instant packs or basic frozen sections. 10-20 RMB for a bag.
   - **How to cook**: Steam over boiling water for 8-10 minutes. Pair with noodles or veggies if you want.
   - **Why it fits**: Bite-sized like dumplings, protein-rich, and no chopping needed.

### 5. **Other Dim Sum Items (like Har Gow or Siu Mai)**
   - **What to buy**: Frozen shrimp dumplings (har gow) or open pork dumplings (siu mai) in dim sum assortments. Search "点心" (dim sum) on JD.com—brands like "真味珍" (Zhenwei Zhen). Packs around 25-35 RMB for 10-15 pieces.
   - **How to cook**: Steam for 7-10 minutes. These are Cantonese classics, perfect for Guangzhou.
   - **Why it fits**: Variety in one pack, steamed like buns for a restaurant feel at home.

**Tips for Guangzhou/JD.com**:
- Use JD's app for local warehouses (faster delivery to areas like Tianhe or Yuexiu). Search in Chinese for more options, or use filters for "速冻" (frozen) and "蒸" (steamable).
- Stock up on basics like steamer paper or dipping sauces (soy, vinegar, chili) from JD too.
- For variety, rotate proteins to keep it interesting—aim for 1-2 packs a week to save time.
- If you have a microwave, some can be adapted, but steaming keeps the authentic texture.
