### **Conclusion**
The Turing Award celebrates the architects of computing’s most transformative technologies, from algorithms and compilers to AI and networking. Breakthroughs like deep learning, reinforcement learning, relational databases, and Ethernet have reshaped society, enabling everything from smartphones to scientific discoveries.
