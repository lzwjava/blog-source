Cooking dried squid in an air fryer is a quick and easy way to achieve a crispy, flavorful snack. Here’s a simple guide based on available methods:

1. **Soak the Squid**: 
   - Rinse the dried squid under cold water to remove excess salt or debris.
   - Soak in lukewarm water for 10-15 minutes to soften slightly. This reduces toughness and excess saltiness. Pat dry with paper towels afterward.

2. **Prepare the Squid**:
   - If the squid is whole, cut it into bite-sized pieces or strips for even cooking.
   - Optionally, lightly coat with a small amount of oil (e.g., olive or sesame oil) for extra crispiness and flavor. You can also season with chili powder, garlic powder, or a pinch of salt if desired, but be cautious as dried squid is often already salty.

3. **Air Fryer Setup**:
   - Preheat your air fryer to 360°F (180°C) for about 3 minutes.
   - Place the squid pieces in a single layer in the air fryer basket to ensure even cooking. Avoid overcrowding.

4. **Cook**:
   - Air fry at 360°F (180°C) for 5-8 minutes, shaking the basket or flipping the squid halfway through to ensure even crisping.
   - Check for a golden, crispy texture. If not crispy enough, cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, but watch closely to avoid burning.

5. **Serve**:
   - Let the squid cool slightly, as it will crisp up more as it cools.
   - Serve as a snack or with dipping sauces like soy sauce with chili or a spicy mayo.

**Tips**:
- Cooking times may vary depending on the air fryer model and the thickness of the squid. Start with shorter times and adjust as needed.
- If the squid is too chewy, it may need a bit more soaking or cooking time.
- For added flavor, you can marinate the soaked squid in a mix of soy sauce, garlic, and sesame oil for 10-15 minutes before air frying.

This method is derived from general air fryer techniques for dried seafood, as seen in recipes for similar items like fish skin or calamari. Enjoy your crispy dried squid!
