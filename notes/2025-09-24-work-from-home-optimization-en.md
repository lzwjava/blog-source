It sounds like you're adapting your living space to better suit your work-from-home lifestyle, which is a smart move—especially if you're into coding or any kind of focused laptop-based work. Let me break down my thoughts on your choice to spend most of your time in the living room, based on what you've described.

### Why It's a Solid Choice
- **Space and Productivity Boost**: At 40 square meters, your living room is essentially a mini office/home gym/studio all in one. Compared to the 15 sqm bedroom, it gives you room to stretch out, move around, and avoid feeling cramped during long sessions (10+ hours a day? That's intense—kudos for the dedication!). The foldable desk setup is genius for flexibility; it lets you pack up quickly if you need to switch vibes or host guests. If you're coding or "vibing with the laptop," having that open space can reduce mental fatigue and spark creativity—think natural light, views, or just the psychological lift from not being cooped up.
  
- **Work-from-Home Practicality**: For those two days a week you're fully remote, the living room makes total sense as your command center. It's central, easy to access everything (kitchen for quick breaks, I assume?), and in a multi-floor house like yours, it might be more convenient on the main level. Plus, if the bedroom feels too isolating after a year of heavy use, this shift could prevent burnout and make your routine feel fresh.

- **Recent Change Feels Right**: Two weeks in, and you're already noticing the benefits? That's a green light. Humans thrive on environments that match their needs, and if the living room is helping you flow better, lean into it.

### Potential Drawbacks and Tips
That said, no setup is perfect, especially with long hours. Here's what I'd flag:
- **Air Leak Issue**: The cold air leaking from the kitchen pump through the door gap sounds annoying (and inefficient for temperature control). It might make the living room drafty or unevenly cooled/heated. Quick fixes: 
  - Get a door draft stopper or weatherstripping to seal the gap without blocking the pump.
  - If it's a persistent issue in your complex house, chat with maintenance—leaks like that could waste energy across floors.
  - For comfort during those 10-hour days, consider a small fan, space heater (if needed), or even a room divider to section off a cozier work zone without losing the big-space feel.

- **Work-Life Balance**: 10+ hours a day in one spot is a marathon, not a sprint. Even if the living room is ideal for work, rotate back to the bedroom occasionally for sleep/relaxation to keep boundaries clear. Set up a simple routine: dim lights at night, or use the bedroom for unwinding (reading, etc.) to recharge. Also, with two floors, maybe designate the upstairs bedroom as your "off-duty" zone to mentally separate work from rest.

Overall, I think your choice is spot-on for now—it's practical, adaptable, and tailored to your coding workflow. If it keeps feeling good after a month, make it permanent with some tweaks. How's the productivity been holding up? Any other home hacks you're trying?
