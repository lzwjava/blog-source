Binance offers a wide range of trading tools and products designed for buying, selling, earning, and advanced strategies with cryptocurrencies. Here's a breakdown of key offerings, including the ones you mentioned like Dual Investment (often called "Dual Payment" in some contexts) and Simple Earn, based on their main features:

### Trading Tools
- **Spot Trading**: Basic buy/sell of crypto assets at current market prices. Supports over 350 coins, with features like limit orders, market orders, and OCO (One-Cancels-the-Other) for automated strategies.
- **Futures Trading**: Leveraged contracts for speculating on price movements without owning the asset. Includes perpetual and quarterly futures with up to 125x leverage, hedging tools, and advanced order types like stop-limit.
- **Margin Trading**: Borrow funds to amplify trades on spot markets, with isolated/cross margin modes and up to 10x leverage.
- **Options Trading**: Buy/sell call/put options on BTC, ETH, etc., for hedging or speculation. Features vanilla European-style options with customizable strikes and expiries.
- **Convert**: Simple tool to swap one crypto for another without fees, ideal for quick conversions.

### Earn and Investment Products
- **Simple Earn**: A flexible or locked staking program to earn interest on idle assets. 
  - Flexible: Withdraw anytime, yields around 1-5% APY depending on the asset.
  - Locked: Higher yields (up to 10%+ APY) for fixed terms (7-120 days).
  - Supports hundreds of tokens; auto-subscribe for rewards.
- **Dual Investment**: A structured product combining options and fixed yields. You subscribe with a crypto, choose a target price, and get either the asset at maturity or a fixed yield (typically 5-20% APY). It's "dual" because it offers two potential outcomes: higher yield if price hits target, or principal back. Subscriptions last 7-90 days.
- **Other Earn Options**:
  - **Savings**: High-yield accounts for stablecoins like USDT (up to 5% APY).
  - **Launchpool**: Stake BNB or other tokens to farm new project tokens for free.
  - **Liquidity Farming/Pools**: Provide liquidity on DEX for rewards, with impermanent loss protection tools.

These tools are accessible via the Binance app or website, with risk warnings for leveraged products. Always check eligibility by region.
