Yes, that's correct—for FPS (Faster Payment System) transfers in Hong Kong, you can send money to recipients using their registered FPS proxy ID, email address, or mobile phone number. These act as identifiers linked to their bank or e-wallet account, making transfers quick and easy without needing full bank details.

Just ensure both you and the recipient have FPS enabled with a participating bank or stored-value facility (SVF), and the proxy is registered correctly.
