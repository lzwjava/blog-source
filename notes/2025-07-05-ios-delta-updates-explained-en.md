title: iOS Delta Updates Explained
translated: false

You're correct that iOS app updates don't always require downloading the full app package. Since iOS 6, Apple has supported **delta updates** for apps, meaning only the changed files (patches) are downloaded rather than the entire app, significantly reducing download sizes in many cases. This is especially true for apps where only small portions, like code or specific assets, have changed. However, the actual size of an update depends on what’s changed, and sometimes updates can still be large if major assets or codebases are modified.[](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/375631/does-ios-download-only-changes-or-whole-app-when-updating-an-app)[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8052210/ios-application-updating-is-it-possible-to-do-partial-update-of-app)

Let’s break down your scenario:

- **400 apps with weekly updates**: You estimate 80 apps updating weekly, each with a 5 MB patch, totaling 400 MB. This is a reasonable estimate for many apps, as delta updates often range from a few MB to tens of MB for minor updates. For example, apps like Facebook or PayPal, which can be large (300+ MB total size), often have updates much smaller than their full size due to delta packaging. However, some apps, especially games or those with heavy assets (e.g., new graphics, levels), may have larger updates, potentially 50-100 MB or more, even with delta updates.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/9ztpnb/when_ios_app_updates_show_the_size_in_mb_is_it/)[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34290490/ios-app-update-size-is-much-bigger-than-app-size)

- **Is 400 MB acceptable?**: This depends on your data plan, storage, and network speed. For most modern data plans (e.g., 5G or Wi-Fi with 10-100 Mbps), 400 MB weekly is manageable, taking just a few minutes to download. For context, 400 MB is less than streaming an hour of HD video. If you’re on a limited data plan (e.g., 2-5 GB/month), 400 MB/week could consume 1.6 GB/month, which might be significant. Also, ensure your iPhone has enough storage for temporary files during installation, as updates may briefly require double the space (old and new files coexist until installation completes).[](https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/1d7x1vb/why_do_updates_take_significantly_more_storage/)

- **400 apps on your iPhone**: This is technically fine, but there are caveats:
  - **Storage**: 400 apps, even if small (e.g., 50-100 MB each), could easily consume 20-40 GB or more, depending on app size and data (e.g., caches, documents). Heavy apps like games or productivity suites could push this higher. Check Settings > General > iPhone Storage to monitor usage.
  - **Performance**: iPhones handle many apps well, but 400 apps could slow down search, app library navigation, or background processes, especially on older models (e.g., iPhone XR or earlier). Newer models (e.g., iPhone 15/16) with more RAM and faster storage are better equipped.
  - **Update management**: Updating 80 apps weekly is feasible with automatic updates enabled (Settings > App Store > App Updates). However, manually updating this many apps could be tedious, and background updates may strain battery or network if not managed (e.g., schedule updates overnight on Wi-Fi).

- **Practical considerations**:
  - **Delta update reliability**: While delta updates reduce download sizes, they’re not guaranteed to be tiny. If an app’s core files change significantly, the update could approach the full app size. Also, if an update fails (e.g., due to network issues), iOS may fall back to downloading a larger package.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34290490/ios-app-update-size-is-much-bigger-than-app-size)
  - **Storage during updates**: iOS needs extra space to unpack and install updates. For 80 apps at 5 MB each, you might need 1-2 GB free for temporary files, especially if multiple updates process simultaneously.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/1d7x1vb/why_do_updates_take_significantly_more_storage/)
  - **Battery and performance**: Frequent updates for 400 apps could tax older devices, especially if many apps run background tasks. Consider enabling updates only on Wi-Fi and when charging (Settings > App Store > Automatic Downloads).

**Conclusion**: Your plan to manage 400 apps with 400 MB weekly updates is generally acceptable, thanks to delta updates keeping download sizes low. However, monitor your iPhone’s storage (keep at least 5-10 GB free) and consider your data plan limits. For smoother performance, you might periodically offload unused apps (Settings > General > iPhone Storage > Offload Unused Apps) to free up space without losing data. If you’re on a newer iPhone (e.g., 14/15/16 series) with ample storage (128 GB+), this setup should work fine. For older devices or lower storage (e.g., 64 GB), you might face constraints, especially if apps or their data grow over time.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/1d7x1vb/why_do_updates_take_significantly_more_storage/)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/9ztpnb/when_ios_app_updates_show_the_size_in_mb_is_it/)
