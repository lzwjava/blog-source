title: Ripgrep vs Ack Key Differences

---

Here’s a structured comparison of **ripgrep (rg)** and **ack**, without using a table format so it’s easier to read:

---

### 1. Speed and Performance

* **ripgrep** is extremely fast. It’s built in Rust, uses memory-mapped I/O, SIMD optimizations, and parallelism to search directories efficiently. It often outperforms both `ack` and `grep`.
* **ack** is written in Perl, and while it’s faster than traditional `grep` for large codebases (because it skips irrelevant files by default), it’s noticeably slower than `ripgrep` when searching large directories.

---

### 2. File Filtering

* **ripgrep** automatically respects `.gitignore` and `.ignore` files, so it avoids binary files and files excluded by version control rules.
* **ack** has its own file-filtering rules (ignores binary files, VCS directories like `.git/`, `CVS/`, etc.) and is designed with programmers in mind, but it doesn’t integrate `.gitignore` by default (you need `ack --ignore-dir` for similar behavior).

---

### 3. Usability and Features

* **ripgrep** has a `grep`-like syntax, so users coming from `grep` find it very natural. It also supports common flags like `-i`, `-n`, `-v`.
* **ack** introduces its own interface, with shortcuts for code searching (e.g., `ack --perl foo` searches only in Perl files). It’s designed specifically for developers browsing source code.

---

### 4. Regular Expressions

* **ripgrep** uses Rust’s regex engine, which is very fast but lacks some advanced features like backreferences and look-behind assertions.
* **ack** uses Perl’s regex engine, so it supports the full range of Perl-compatible regular expressions, including advanced features.

---

### 5. Installation and Portability

* **ripgrep** is a compiled binary, available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Easy to install via package managers (e.g., `brew install ripgrep`).
* **ack** is a Perl script, so it requires Perl installed. That makes it highly portable (runs anywhere Perl runs) but slightly less convenient for environments without Perl.

---

### 6. Community and Ecosystem

* **ripgrep** has quickly become the go-to choice for developers and is often integrated into editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, and Neovim for “find in project”.
* **ack** was very popular in the late 2000s and early 2010s and inspired `ag` (the Silver Searcher) and `ripgrep`, but its community is smaller now.

---

### Summary

* Choose **ripgrep** if you want maximum speed, automatic `.gitignore` integration, and a `grep`-like feel. It’s the modern standard for searching large codebases.
* Choose **ack** if you rely on Perl-compatible regex features or want language-specific search shortcuts built in. It’s slower but more regex-capable.

Do you want me to also include a **historical timeline** of how `grep → ack → ag → ripgrep` evolved? That would give you the full context of why ripgrep is dominant now.
