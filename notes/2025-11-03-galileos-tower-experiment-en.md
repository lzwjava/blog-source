### Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa Experiment

Galileo's "Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment" refers to a famous (though likely apocryphal) demonstration attributed to the Italian physicist and astronomer Galileo Galilei in the late 16th century. The story goes that, around 1589–1592, while teaching at the University of Pisa, Galileo climbed to the top of the city's iconic Leaning Tower and dropped two objects of different masses—such as a heavy cannonball and a lighter musket ball—from the same height at the same time.

The key observation: Both objects hit the ground simultaneously, regardless of their weight. This challenged the long-held Aristotelian view that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones. Instead, it supported Galileo's emerging principle that, in the absence of air resistance, all objects accelerate toward Earth at the same rate (about 9.8 m/s² due to gravity).

#### Historical Context and Significance
- **Purpose**: Galileo aimed to refute ancient philosopher Aristotle's ideas on motion, which dominated physics for over 2,000 years. Aristotle claimed falling speed was proportional to an object's mass.
- **Outcome**: The experiment (if it happened) showed that air resistance, not mass, causes lighter objects to fall slower in everyday conditions. This laid groundwork for his later work in *Two New Sciences* (1638), where he formalized these ideas mathematically.
- **Is it Real?** No contemporary accounts from Galileo describe it exactly this way— the tale was popularized in 19th-century biographies. However, Galileo did conduct similar dropping experiments, possibly indoors or with pendulums, and the principle is sound and has been replicated countless times (e.g., Apollo 15's feather-and-hammer drop on the Moon in 1971).

This experiment symbolizes the shift from qualitative philosophy to empirical science during the Scientific Revolution.
