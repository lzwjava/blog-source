To air fry potato slices, the cooking time depends on thickness, temperature, and desired crispiness. For thinly sliced potatoes (about 1/8 inch or 3-4 mm thick), here’s a general guide:

- **Temperature**: 400°F (200°C)
- **Time**: 12-18 minutes
- **Steps**:
  1. Slice potatoes thinly and evenly (use a mandoline for consistency).
  2. Toss with 1-2 tsp oil, salt, and optional seasonings (e.g., paprika, garlic powder).
  3. Arrange in a single layer in the air fryer basket (avoid overcrowding; cook in batches if needed).
  4. Cook for 12-18 minutes, shaking the basket or flipping slices halfway through to ensure even cooking.
  5. Check for crispiness; add 2-3 minutes if needed for extra crunch.

**Notes**:
- Thicker slices (1/4 inch or 6 mm) may need 18-22 minutes.
- Soak slices in cold water for 20-30 minutes and pat dry to reduce starch for crispier results.
- Cooking times vary slightly by air fryer model, so check for doneness.
