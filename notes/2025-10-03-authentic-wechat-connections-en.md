Yes, you're spot on—WeChat has become a massive hub for business, networking, and everything in between in China over the past decade, but it's not without its pitfalls like account bans for spam, policy violations, or even competitive sabotage. Instead of constantly spinning up new accounts (which can be risky and against platform rules), focusing on building authentic, mutually respectful connections is a smarter, more sustainable approach. Here's why and how it works in practice:

### Why Real-Life Networking Beats "Account Hopping"
- **Avoids Bans and Builds Trust**: Genuine relationships based on shared interests or in-person interactions are less likely to lead to reports or blocks. People are more forgiving (and supportive) when there's real mutual respect, rather than seeing you as just another sales pitch in their messages.
- **Diverse Opportunities**: Expanding your circle beyond business-only contacts opens doors to unexpected collaborations. Street food vendors might connect you to local suppliers, colleagues could lead to job referrals, and hobby groups (like hiking clubs or book clubs) often spark organic business ideas.
- **Long-Term Resilience**: WeChat policies evolve, but human networks endure. In real life, you're not at the mercy of an algorithm or a single report.

### Practical Tips to Add More "Mutual Respect" Contacts
1. **Leverage Your Existing Circle**: Start with people you already know—colleagues, friends-of-friends, or even casual acquaintances from work events. Ask for warm intros: "Hey, I met [mutual friend] at that conference—mind if I add you on WeChat?"
   
2. **Meet in Real Life (IRL) First**:
   - **Friend Circles and Events**: Join local meetups via apps like Meetup, Douban, or even WeChat groups for offline gatherings. Attend industry talks, markets, or community events where you can chat naturally before scanning QR codes.
   - **Diverse Groups**: Target street food scenes (chat with vendors while grabbing a snack—they often have vast local networks), office happy hours, or hobby communities (e.g., photography clubs, fitness groups, or language exchanges). Aim for 1-2 new connections per week to keep it organic.
   - **Pro Tip**: Always lead with value—share a tip, compliment their work, or offer help first. This sets a tone of respect from the start.

3. **On WeChat, Keep It Clean**:
   - Use your profile to reflect authenticity (a real photo, bio about your interests/business).
   - Group wisely: Create or join interest-based groups (e.g., "Beijing Street Food Lovers" or "Startup Hobbyists") rather than spamming sales.
   - If you're in business, focus on providing free value (tips, resources) to nurture relationships over time.

This way, your network grows stronger and more diverse, turning potential "bans" into a non-issue. Have you tried any of these strategies yourself, or is there a specific type of business/network you're building? I'd love to hear more!
