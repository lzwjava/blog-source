Absolutely, I think you're onto something profound here. Viewing technological progress through "tech points"—those pivotal inventions, papers, or breakthroughs that redefine possibilities—often gives a clearer, more foundational understanding of how the world evolves, rather than getting lost in the sea of end-user applications and incremental builds. Let me break this down and expand on your examples, as it aligns with how innovation cascades from core ideas to widespread adoption.

### Why Tech Points Offer Better Clarity
- **Focus on Inflection Points**: History shows that tech advances aren't linear; they're punctuated by breakthroughs that unlock entirely new paradigms. For instance, the iPhone's launch in 2007 wasn't just a phone—it introduced multitouch interfaces, app ecosystems, and mobile computing as we know it. Without that singular "tech point," the thousands of apps you mention (built via Xcode on iOS or similar on Android) wouldn't exist in their current form. Observing from this lens helps trace causality: one device sparked an industry worth trillions, rather than diluting the view across 1000+ apps like TikTok or Uber, which are essentially layers on top.
  
- **From Papers to Products**: Your mention of "Attention is All You Need" (the 2017 Google paper introducing the Transformer architecture) is a perfect example. This wasn't a flashy consumer product; it was a dense academic idea that revolutionized AI by showing how attention mechanisms could handle sequences better than previous models like RNNs. Fast-forward, and it underpins ChatGPT (launched in 2022 by OpenAI), which itself became a cultural phenomenon. If we only looked at "broad user points"—like the millions using AI chatbots or tools built on similar backends (e.g., Java/Spring Boot for scalable servers)—we'd miss how one architecture enabled an explosion of LLMs, from GPT-4 to competitors like Grok.

- **Mobile Tech as a Broader Wave**: Extending your iPhone example, mobile tech's evolution (from early smartphones to 5G and edge computing) is another tech point cluster. The iPhone democratized app development, but the real magic was in underlying enablers like ARM processors, iOS APIs, and Android's open-source model. Apps are the visible tip; the iceberg is the tech stack (Xcode for iOS devs, Kotlin/Java for Android, and server-side frameworks like Spring Boot for handling user data at scale). By zooming in on these points, we see patterns: innovation often starts with hardware/software primitives, then scales via ecosystems.

### Counterpoint: User Points Aren't Useless, But They're Derivative
You're right that the "1000 popular apps" view can feel overwhelming and superficial—most are indeed built on established platforms (iOS/Android for frontends, Java/Spring Boot or Node.js for backends). This broad perspective highlights adoption and market dynamics, which matter for business or sociology (e.g., how apps shape social behavior). But it risks missing the forest for the trees: without Transformers, no ChatGPT boom; without the iPhone, no app store economy. Tech points reveal the dependencies and inspire forward-thinking—predicting what's next, like quantum computing or neuromorphic chips, rather than reacting to the latest viral app.

In short, yes, observing through tech points sharpens our lens on what's truly transformative. It encourages asking: "What core idea enabled this?" instead of "How many users does it have?" If we apply this to today (mid-2025), keep an eye on things like multimodal AI integrations or sustainable computing—those could be the next big points.
