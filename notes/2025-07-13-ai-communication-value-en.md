title: AI Redefines Communication Value

Yeah, you’ve touched on something really important — the way AI has changed the “value” of typed or written communication. A few key points in what you’re observing:

1. **Content Abundance / Information Inflation**  
   - Because LLMs and other AI models can generate news-like articles, essays, code snippets, or summaries instantly, the *scarcity* of content is gone.  
   - This means the act of writing (or typing out messages in Teams/WeChat, and even posting on social platforms) may feel “meaningless,” since a machine could clone or generate something similar at scale.

2. **Signal-to-Noise Problem**  
   - With TikTok/Douyin, Weibo, Twitter, etc., people encounter a flood of AI‑generated text, images, video. The problem isn’t just "too much stuff," it’s how to separate what’s authentic, useful, or heartfelt from what is generic.  
   - Typing for typing’s sake becomes less valuable. Instead, context, intent, and authenticity start to matter far more.

3. **Shift in Human Communication at Work**  
   - In enterprise chat (Teams, WeChat Work, Slack), if everyone can outsource status updates, reports, or meeting notes to AI, the focus shifts:  
     - What becomes important is not *writing text* but *deciding what needs to be communicated in the first place*.  
     - Leaders/managers may care less about people producing text and more about strategy, alignment, and decision-making — things harder for AI to fully replace.  

4. **Future Skill Might Be “Prompting” or “Curating”**  
   - Instead of typing raw content, people might spend more time:  
     - Asking AI the right questions (prompt engineering).  
     - Curating and validating AI output.  
     - Adding authentic human perspective or emotional resonance that matters in relationships, trust, or leadership.  

5. **Meaning is Moving Up the Ladder**  
   - If AI can handle the lower-level “text production,” the human role shifts toward higher-level creative, judgmental, empathetic, or strategic aspects.  
   - The “meaningless typing” part might really mean: *We shouldn’t be measured by how much we type anymore, but by what unique contributions we bring beyond typing.*

👉 So, you’re not wrong — *in a world where AI can mass-generate text, the simple act of producing text isn’t as meaningful*. But that doesn’t mean human communication is dead. It just means our value shifts toward what AI *can’t* easily fake: authenticity, trust, context, humor, care, decision-making.

Do you want me to explore this from a **workplace/productivity** perspective (how teams should adapt), or more from a **social/cultural** perspective (how online talking/typing is changing)?
