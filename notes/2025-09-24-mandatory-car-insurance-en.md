Yes, buying car insurance is essential in China—specifically, third-party liability insurance (which covers damages or injuries you cause to others) is **mandatory** under Chinese law. You can't legally drive without at least the minimum coverage, and skipping it could lead to fines, license suspension, or worse if you're in an accident. Your father's advice makes a lot of sense, especially in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangzhou, where luxury cars (e.g., Mercedes, BMWs, or even supercars) are common, and repair/replacement costs can easily exceed 1 million RMB. Let me break this down to help you decide on the 1M, 2M, or 3M levels for property damage coverage (the bodily injury parts are usually fixed at higher minimums).

### Quick Basics of Third-Party Insurance in China
- **Minimum requirements**: 
  - Bodily injury: 50,000 RMB per person / 100,000 RMB per accident (often bundled higher in policies).
  - Property damage: 100,000 RMB minimum, but almost everyone buys more because it's not enough for modern cars.
- **Common add-ons**: Many policies include theft, collision, or comprehensive coverage, but you're focusing on third-party liability, which pays for the other party's losses if you're at fault.
- **Where to buy**: Through insurers like PICC, Ping An, or via apps like those from Alipay/WeChat. Premiums are based on your car model, driving history, and city—expect 500–2,000 RMB/year for basic third-party, scaling up with higher limits.
- **Key point**: If your claim exceeds your coverage, you'll pay the difference out of pocket. In a big city accident with an expensive car, that could bankrupt you.

### Should You Go for 1M, 2M, or 3M Coverage?
Your father's suggestion of 3 million RMB for property damage is spot-on for big cities. Here's why, with a comparison:

- **1 Million RMB**:
  - Pros: Cheaper premium (maybe 20–50% less than higher levels). Covers most everyday accidents (e.g., minor fender-benders or mid-range cars).
  - Cons: In a big city, it's risky. If you hit a luxury SUV (e.g., a Range Rover worth 1.5M+), you'll still owe a lot. Average car prices in cities like Shanghai are rising, and claims for high-end vehicles often top 1M quickly (tires, paint, sensors add up).
  - Best for: Rural areas or budget drivers with low exposure to luxury traffic.

- **2 Million RMB**:
  - Pros: Good middle ground—covers most urban accidents, including many luxury cars. Premium is reasonable (often just 100–300 RMB more than 1M).
  - Cons: Still might not fully protect against top-tier collisions (e.g., a Porsche or Tesla Model X). In dense city traffic, the risk of hitting something pricey is higher.
  - Best for: Medium-sized cities or if you're on a moderate budget.

- **3 Million RMB** (or even 5M, which is common now)**:
  - Pros: Excellent peace of mind in big cities. It would cover damages to most vehicles on the road, including exotics. Chinese insurers often offer this level, and it's becoming standard for urban drivers. Your father is right—compensation claims in places like Beijing can hit 2–3M easily for repairs, medical bills, or totaled cars. Higher limits also sometimes give discounts on premiums or faster claims processing.
  - Cons: Slightly higher cost (maybe 20–50% more than 1M, depending on your insurer). But the premium difference is tiny compared to potential out-of-pocket costs.
  - Best for: Big cities with heavy traffic and expensive cars, like where you are. If you're in a Tier 1 city, this is what I'd recommend as a minimum.

### My Recommendation
Go for **at least 2 million, but ideally 3 million** if your budget allows—especially since you're in a big city. The extra cost is worth it to avoid financial ruin from one bad accident. For example:
- If you drive a standard sedan in Shanghai and scrape a Ferrari, 3M could save you hundreds of thousands.
- Check your risk: If you drive a lot in high-traffic areas (e.g., highways or downtown), bump it up. If it's mostly local errands, 2M might suffice.

### Other Tips
- **Total cost**: Factor in your full policy. Third-party is just part—consider adding comprehensive (for your own car) if you can afford it (another 1,000–3,000 RMB/year).
- **Discounts**: Safe driving records, no-claim history, or bundling with other insurance can lower premiums by 20–30%.
- **Get quotes**: Use apps like "中国人保" (PICC), "平安好车主" (Ping An), or comparison sites. Input your car details for personalized pricing.
- **Legal note**: Always carry proof of insurance. In China, traffic police check this strictly.
- **Consult pros**: This isn't financial advice—talk to an insurance agent or use online calculators. Rules can vary by province (e.g., stricter in Beijing).
