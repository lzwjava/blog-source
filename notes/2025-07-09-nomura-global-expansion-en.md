Nomura Holdings is Japan's largest investment bank and one of Asia's premier financial services companies. Here's a comprehensive introduction to the firm:

## Company Overview

Nomura is a global financial services group with an integrated network spanning over 30 countries and regions. By connecting markets East & West, Nomura services the needs of individuals, institutions, corporates and governments through its three business divisions: Retail, Wholesale (Global Markets and Investment Banking), and Investment Management. Founded in 1925, the firm is built on a tradition of disciplined entrepreneurship, serving clients with creative solutions and considered thought leadership.

## Business Structure

Nomura operates through three primary divisions:

**Retail Division**: Serves individual investors and high-net-worth clients in Japan with investment products, advisory services, and wealth management solutions.

**Wholesale Division**: Encompasses Global Markets and Investment Banking services, providing trading, market-making, underwriting, M&A advisory, and other corporate finance services to institutional clients worldwide.

**Investment Management**: Manages assets for institutional and retail clients, offering various investment strategies across asset classes.

## Recent Major Developments

In April 2025, Nomura agreed to acquire Macquarie's U.S. and European public asset management business in a $1.8 billion all-cash deal. This significant acquisition will take on roughly $180 billion in new assets across equities, fixed income and multi-asset strategies, for a total of approximately $770 billion in total assets under management (AUM). Expected to close by the end of 2025, the acquisition represents Nomura's largest international expansion since 2008, when it bought Lehman Brothers' Asian and European assets.

## Financial Performance

As of July 2025 Nomura Holdings's TTM revenue is of ₹931.96 Billion. The company continues to focus on diversifying its revenue streams and expanding its asset management capabilities to reduce dependence on volatile trading income.

## Strategic Focus

Japan's financial institutions have sought to develop their asset and wealth management businesses to generate income from the mammoth savings held by Japanese households, of which around half is currently held in cash and deposits. Nomura Holdings Inc. is setting its sights on the US for growth despite the current turmoil surrounding the world's biggest economy.

## Global Presence

While headquartered in Tokyo, Nomura has established a significant international presence, particularly in Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the Americas. The firm positions itself as a bridge between Eastern and Western markets, leveraging its deep understanding of Asian markets and its global network to serve clients worldwide.

Nomura continues to be a major player in Japanese finance while pursuing strategic international expansion, particularly in asset management, to diversify its business model and capture growth opportunities in global markets.
