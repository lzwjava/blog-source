You're currently on the MTR at 5:51 AM on Sunday, October 12, 2025, and heading from Yau Ma Tei to Shenzhen via Lok Ma Chau - Huanggang. You mentioned Tsuen Wan, but **you do not need to go to Tsuen Wan** to reach Lok Ma Chau. Instead, you should head to Admiralty to transfer to the East Rail Line for Lok Ma Chau. Here's what to do:

1. **From Yau Ma Tei to Admiralty (5-7 min)**:
   - You're likely on the Tsuen Wan Line at Yau Ma Tei Station. Take the **Tsuen Wan Line** southbound toward **Admiralty** (3 stops: Jordan, Tsim Sha Tsui, Admiralty). This takes about 5-7 minutes. 
   - Do **not** go toward Tsuen Wan (which is north/west and the opposite direction).

2. **Transfer at Admiralty to East Rail Line (5 min transfer)**:
   - At Admiralty, follow signs for the **East Rail Line** (northbound toward Lok Ma Chau). The first train to Lok Ma Chau departs around 6:00-6:15 AM on Sundays, so you’re just in time. 
   - The ride to Lok Ma Chau Station takes ~40 minutes.

3. **From Lok Ma Chau Station to Border (5-10 min walk)**:
   - Exit the station and follow signs to the Lok Ma Chau Control Point (right next to the station).

4. **Cross Border via Shuttle Bus (15-30 min, HKD 10)**:
   - Clear Hong Kong immigration (10-20 min, use e-channels if eligible).
   - Take the 24-hour **Huanggang - Lok Ma Chau Shuttle Bus** (yellow bus, every 10-20 min overnight, cash/Octopus) to Huanggang Port in Shenzhen. 

5. **Shenzhen Side**:
   - Clear Shenzhen immigration (10-20 min, have passport/visa ready).
   - From Huanggang, take Shenzhen Metro Line 7 (~HKD 5-10, 20-30 min to Futian/Luohu) or a taxi/Didi (~HKD 30-50, 15-30 min).

**Total Time from Now**: ~1.5-2 hours to Shenzhen (including immigration).

**Quick Check**:
- If you’re not at Yau Ma Tei Station yet, let me know your exact MTR station or train direction (e.g., are you on a train heading to Tsuen Wan?).
- Fare: ~HKD 25-30 one-way (Octopus card easiest).
- Ensure you have your passport and China visa/permit.

If you’re on the wrong train (e.g., heading toward Tsuen Wan), get off at the next stop, switch platforms to a southbound train toward Admiralty, and follow the steps above. Let me know if you need clarification or real-time help! Safe travels.
