### China's Economic Performance in Recent Years (2020–2025)

China's economy has shown resilience amid global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and domestic issues such as the property sector crisis and youth unemployment. After a sharp rebound in 2021, growth has moderated but remained positive, outperforming many peers. Key drivers include strong exports and manufacturing, while headwinds include weak domestic consumption, deflationary pressures, and rising debt levels. As of mid-2025, the economy is projected to grow at around 4.8% for the full year, down from 5.0% in 2024, reflecting a shift toward "high-quality" growth focused on technology and services.

#### GDP Growth Overview
China's GDP expanded from about $14.7 trillion in 2020 to an estimated $19.2 trillion in 2025 (nominal USD). Annual real growth rates have trended downward from pandemic highs:

| Year | GDP Growth Rate (%) | Key Notes |
|------|----------------------|-----------|
| 2020 | 2.3                 | Only major economy with positive growth during global lockdowns; strict zero-COVID measures contained the virus but disrupted supply chains. |
| 2021 | 8.1                 | Strong rebound fueled by exports, infrastructure spending, and stimulus. |
| 2022 | 3.0                 | Slowest in decades due to prolonged zero-COVID lockdowns and property market woes. |
| 2023 | 5.2                 | Recovery as restrictions lifted; exports surged amid global demand. |
| 2024 | 5.0                 | Steady expansion despite deflation and weak consumer spending; Q4 hit 5.4%. |
| 2025 | 4.8 (projected)     | Moderation expected from trade uncertainties and slowing property recovery; Q2 was 5.2%. |

Sources vary slightly (e.g., official stats vs. IMF estimates), but these reflect consensus figures.

#### Other Key Indicators
- **Inflation**: Persistently low, with bouts of deflation in 2024–2025 due to overcapacity and weak demand. Annual CPI rates: 2.5% (2020), 0.9% (2021), 2.0% (2022), 0.2% (2023), 0.2% (2024), and ~0.9% projected for 2025. Core inflation hovers around 0.5%.
  
- **Unemployment**: Official urban rate stable at ~5.0–5.3%, but youth unemployment (ages 16–24) peaked at 21% in mid-2023 before easing to ~15% in 2025. Structural issues like job mismatches persist.

- **Government Debt**: Rising steadily as fiscal stimulus ramps up. Debt-to-GDP ratio: ~66% (2020), ~70% (2021), ~75% (2022), ~80% (2023), ~88% (2024), projected ~88% end-2025. Total debt (including corporate/household) exceeds 300% of GDP, raising sustainability concerns.

- **Trade**: A bright spot, with record surpluses supporting growth. Annual trade surplus: $535B (2020), $676B (2021), $878B (2022), $823B (2023), ~$950B (2024). Exports grew ~4% yoy in early 2025, driven by EVs and renewables, but U.S./EU tariffs pose risks. Imports lag due to soft domestic demand.

#### Challenges and Outlook
- **Positives**: China remains the world's manufacturing powerhouse, with dominance in green tech and EVs. Policy shifts emphasize consumption and innovation over real estate.
- **Risks**: Property debt (e.g., Evergrande fallout), aging population, and U.S. trade decoupling could drag growth below 4% by 2030. Deflation risks eroding confidence.
- **2025–2026 Projections**: IMF/World Bank forecast 4.4–4.8% growth, assuming no major escalations in trade wars.

Overall, China's economy is transitioning from high-speed to sustainable growth, but faces a delicate balancing act.
