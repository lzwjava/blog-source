### Understanding the Statistic: Cloud Adoption in China vs. the US

The statistic you're referencing—"Only ~20% of Chinese firms use cloud services vs. 90% in the US"—appears to draw from older data (around 2017–2018) highlighting a significant gap in enterprise cloud adoption between the two countries. At that time, surveys showed low public cloud usage among Chinese enterprises, with only about 25% reporting moderate-to-extensive spending on public cloud services (close to the ~20% figure). This contrasted sharply with the US, where adoption was already widespread, exceeding 90% of companies using some form of cloud services by the early 2020s.

#### Key Context and Why the Gap Existed
This disparity wasn't just about technology access but rooted in structural, economic, and regulatory factors in China:
- **Low IT Investment Overall**: Chinese firms historically allocated only ~2% of revenue to IT (half the global average), prioritizing cheap labor over digital tools. Cloud adoption requires mature data processes and workflows, which many lacked.
- **Preference for Private Cloud**: Security concerns, data localization laws (e.g., requiring data to stay in China), and regulatory scrutiny led ~50% of cloud spending to private setups rather than public clouds like AWS or Alibaba Cloud.
- **Industry Focus**: China's economy is heavy on manufacturing and construction (low cloud needs), unlike the US's finance and tech sectors that drive rapid adoption.
- **Migration Barriers**: High perceived costs, security risks, and lack of local expertise slowed uptake—66% of firms cited migration difficulty as a top issue in 2018 surveys.
- **Ecosystem Gaps**: Fewer "on-ramps" like US-style enterprise software (e.g., no strong equivalents to Salesforce or Databricks) and limited consulting firms to guide transitions.

In the US, by contrast, standardized IT infrastructure, mature ecosystems, and competitive pressures pushed adoption to 90%+ by 2020, with public cloud dominating (~24% of IT budgets vs. China's ~6% in 2017).

#### Has This Changed? Updated 2025 Figures
The gap has narrowed significantly due to government pushes (e.g., "Eastern Data, Western Computing" initiative), AI boom, and maturing providers like Alibaba and Huawei Cloud. Recent data shows:
- **China**: ~72% of enterprises now use cloud services (up from ~25% in 2018), with public cloud market size hitting ~$90B by 2025 (from $32B in 2021). Adoption is fastest in tech/internet (near 100%) but still lags in industrials (~27–30%).
- **US**: Remains at 90–94%, with multicloud strategies common (80%+ of firms use multiple providers).

The ~20% figure underscores historical lags but understates China's rapid catch-up—its cloud market grew 16% YoY in Q1 2025 alone, driven by AI.

#### Does "Chinese Firms" Mean All Kinds (Fortune 500, Startups, etc.)?
Yes, it generally refers to enterprises across the board: large corporations (e.g., Fortune Global 500 like Alibaba or state-owned giants), mid-sized firms, SMEs, and startups. However, most surveys (like McKinsey's) focus on mid-to-large enterprises (e.g., those spending >$150K/year on IT), as smaller ones are harder to track and often use basic cloud for hosting rather than full transformation. Startups in tech hubs like Shenzhen adopt faster (~80–90%), while traditional SMEs lag due to cost and skills gaps.
