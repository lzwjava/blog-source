title: LeanChatLib Podspec File Overview
translated: false
---

### Overview
This code is a **Podspec file** written in Ruby, used by [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), a popular dependency manager for iOS and macOS projects. It defines metadata, dependencies, and build instructions for a library called **LeanChatLib**, which appears to be a framework for building instant messaging (IM) apps. The library supports features like sending text, images, audio, video, location messages, and managing contacts.

The file is structured as a Ruby block (`Pod::Spec.new do |s|`) where `s` is a spec object that holds all the configuration. I'll break it down section by section.

### Metadata and Basic Info
```ruby
s.name         = "LeanChatLib"
s.version      = "0.2.6"
s.summary      = "An IM App Framework, support sending text, pictures, audio, video, location messaging, managing address book, more interesting features."
s.homepage     = "https://github.com/leancloud/leanchat-ios"
s.license      = "MIT"
s.authors      = { "LeanCloud" => "support@leancloud.cn" }
```
- **name**: The unique identifier for the pod in CocoaPods repositories (e.g., when you run `pod install`, this is what you reference).
- **version**: The release version of this library (0.2.6). CocoaPods uses this to track updates.
- **summary**: A short description shown in the CocoaPods search results or docs.
- **homepage**: Link to the GitHub repo where the source code lives.
- **license**: MIT license, which is permissive and allows free use/modification.
- **authors**: Credits LeanCloud (a backend service provider) with a contact email.

This section makes the pod discoverable and provides legal/attribution info.

### Source and Distribution
```ruby
s.source       = { :git => "https://github.com/leancloud/leanchat-ios.git", :tag => s.version.to_s }
```
- Defines where CocoaPods fetches the code: from the specified Git repo, checking out the tag matching the version (e.g., "0.2.6").
- When you install the pod, it clones this repo and uses that exact tag for reproducibility.

### Platform and Build Requirements
```ruby
s.platform     = :ios, '7.0'
s.frameworks   = 'Foundation', 'CoreGraphics', 'UIKit', 'MobileCoreServices', 'AVFoundation', 'CoreLocation', 'MediaPlayer', 'CoreMedia', 'CoreText', 'AudioToolbox','MapKit','ImageIO','SystemConfiguration','CFNetwork','QuartzCore','Security','CoreTelephony'
s.libraries    = 'icucore','sqlite3'
s.requires_arc = true
```
- **platform**: Targets iOS 7.0 or later (this is quite old; modern apps would bump this up).
- **frameworks**: Lists iOS system frameworks the library links against. These handle basics like UI (`UIKit`), media (`AVFoundation`), location (`CoreLocation`), maps (`MapKit`), networking (`SystemConfiguration`), and security (`Security`). Including them ensures the app has access during builds.
- **libraries**: Static libraries from the iOS SDK: `icucore` (internationalization) and `sqlite3` (local database).
- **requires_arc**: Enables Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), Apple's memory management system. All code in this pod must use ARC.

This ensures compatibility and links necessary system components for features like media playback and location sharing.

### Source Files and Resources
```ruby
s.source_files = 'LeanChatLib/Classes/**/*.{h,m}'
s.resources    = 'LeanChatLib/Resources/*'
```
- **source_files**: Includes all `.h` (header) and `.m` (Objective-C implementation) files recursively from the `LeanChatLib/Classes/` directory. This bundles the library's core code (e.g., chat logic, UI components).
- **resources**: Copies all files from `LeanChatLib/Resources/` into the app bundle. These could be images, storyboards, or other assets used by the chat UI.

### Dependencies
```ruby
s.dependency 'AVOSCloud', '~> 3.1.4'
s.dependency 'AVOSCloudIM', '~> 3.1.4'
s.dependency 'JSBadgeView', '1.4.1'
s.dependency 'DateTools' , '1.5.0'
s.dependency 'FMDB', '2.5'
```
- Lists external pods this one relies on, with version constraints:
  - **AVOSCloud** and **AVOSCloudIM** (~> 3.1.4): LeanCloud's backend SDKs for cloud storage and real-time IM (instant messaging). These power the server-side chat features.
  - **JSBadgeView** (1.4.1): A simple view for displaying notification badges (e.g., unread message counts).
  - **DateTools** (1.5.0): Utility for date/time formatting and calculations, useful for timestamps in chats.
  - **FMDB** (2.5): A lightweight Objective-C wrapper for SQLite, likely used for local message storage or caching.

The `~>` (tilde-greater-than) means "compatible with" – it allows patch/minor updates but not major ones (e.g., 3.1.4 to 3.2.x, but not 4.0).

### What Does This Achieve?
When you add `pod 'LeanChatLib', '~> 0.2.6'` to your iOS project's `Podfile` and run `pod install`, CocoaPods:
1. Downloads and integrates LeanChatLib's code/resources.
2. Automatically pulls in all dependencies.
3. Configures your Xcode project with the right frameworks, libraries, and ARC settings.

This makes it easy to drop a full IM framework into an app without manually managing Git clones or dependencies. LeanChatLib seems tailored for LeanCloud users, focusing on multimedia messaging and contacts.

If you're building an iOS chat app, this pod would save tons of boilerplate. Note: The version (0.2.6) and iOS 7.0 support suggest it's from around 2015–2016; check the GitHub repo for updates.
