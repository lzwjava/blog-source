生酮饮食 (shēngtóng yǐnshí), also known as the **ketogenic diet** or **keto diet**, is a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat, and adequate-protein diet.

The main goal of the ketogenic diet is to shift the body's metabolism from burning carbohydrates for energy to burning fat. When you drastically reduce carbohydrate intake, your body enters a metabolic state called **ketosis**. In ketosis, the liver breaks down fat into molecules called **ketones**, which then become the primary fuel source for the body, including the brain.

Here's a breakdown of the typical macronutrient ratios in a ketogenic diet:

* **Fats:** Around 70-75% of your daily calorie intake.
* **Protein:** Around 20-25% of your daily calorie intake.
* **Carbohydrates:** Typically 5-10% of your daily calorie intake, often limited to 20-50 grams of net carbs per day.

**Common foods consumed on a ketogenic diet include:**

* **High-fat foods:** Avocados, olive oil, coconut oil, butter, nuts, seeds, fatty fish (salmon, mackerel).
* **Protein sources:** Meat (beef, pork, chicken), eggs, cheese.
* **Low-carb vegetables:** Leafy greens (spinach, kale), broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers.

**Foods to avoid or limit:**

* **High-carb foods:** Grains (rice, bread, pasta), sugary drinks, fruits (especially high-sugar ones), starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn).

**Potential benefits associated with the ketogenic diet:**

* **Weight loss:** By promoting fat burning and often leading to reduced appetite.
* **Blood sugar control:** Particularly beneficial for individuals with type 2 diabetes due to reduced carbohydrate intake.
* **Epilepsy management:** Historically, the ketogenic diet was developed in the 1920s to help manage seizures in children with epilepsy.
* **Improved cognitive function:** Some people report better mental clarity and focus.

**However, it's important to be aware of potential side effects and considerations:**

* **Keto flu:** A common initial side effect including symptoms like fatigue, headache, nausea, and irritability, as the body adjusts.
* **Nutrient deficiencies:** If not well-planned, it can lead to deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals.
* **Digestive issues:** Constipation can be common due to low fiber intake.
* **Not suitable for everyone:** Individuals with certain medical conditions (e.g., pancreatitis, liver conditions, kidney disease) or pregnant/breastfeeding women should avoid the diet or consult a doctor before starting.

If you're considering trying the ketogenic diet, it's highly recommended to **consult with a doctor or a registered dietitian** to ensure it's appropriate for you and to help you plan a healthy and sustainable approach.
