Ray Allen is widely regarded as the better shooter compared to Stephen Curry when evaluating their careers holistically, though the debate is close and depends on specific criteria.

**Ray Allen**:
- **Career 3P%**: 40.0% (2,973/7,429), 2nd all-time in made threes.
- **Strengths**: Elite catch-and-shoot specialist, particularly off screens. Known for consistency and clutch performance (e.g., iconic Game 6 shot in 2013 NBA Finals). Excelled in structured offenses, maximizing efficiency.
- **Context**: Played in an era with less emphasis on volume three-point shooting, facing tighter defenses and fewer open looks due to slower-paced offenses.

**Stephen Curry**:
- **Career 3P%**: 42.6% (4,143/9,718 through 2024-25), 1st all-time in made threes.
- **Strengths**: Unprecedented off-dribble shooting, creating his own shots under heavy pressure. Revolutionized the game with high-volume, deep-range shooting. Leads in advanced metrics like true shooting percentage among guards (62.4% career).
- **Context**: Benefits from modern spacing and pace, but faces defenses designed specifically to counter his shooting. Higher volume (9.9 attempts per game vs. Allen’s 5.7) impacts efficiency slightly.

**Analysis**:
- **Efficiency**: Curry’s 42.6% edges Allen’s 40.0%, despite Curry taking tougher, higher-volume shots.
- **Versatility**: Curry’s ability to shoot off the dribble, from extreme range, and in high-pressure situations gives him an edge in shot creation.
- **Impact**: Curry’s shooting transformed NBA offenses, forcing defenses to adapt. Allen’s impact was profound but less revolutionary.
- **Clutch**: Both are clutch, but Allen’s iconic moments (e.g., 2013 Finals) slightly tip this category in his favor.

**Conclusion**: While Curry’s volume, versatility, and efficiency make a strong case, Ray Allen’s consistency, clutch performance, and elite shooting in a less shooter-friendly era give him a slight edge as the better pure shooter. However, Curry’s transformative impact and ongoing career could shift this over time.
