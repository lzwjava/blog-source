The error you encountered (`Could not find or load main class scripts.benchmark.MultiMark`) occurs because you tried to run the Java program from the project root directory (`~/projects/lzwjava.github.io`) using the fully qualified class name (`scripts.benchmark.MultiMark`), but the Java runtime expects the class to be run from the directory where the package structure starts, or you need to specify the classpath correctly. When you changed to the `scripts/benchmark` directory and ran `java MultiMark`, it worked because the class was in the correct directory relative to the command.

To run `MultiMark.java` or `MultiMark.class` from the project root directory (`~/projects/lzwjava.github.io`) without changing directories, you can use the `-cp` (classpath) option with the `java` command to tell Java where to find the compiled class file. Here are two ways to achieve this, keeping you in the root directory:

---

### **Option 1: Run the Compiled Class with Classpath**
If `MultiMark.class` already exists in `scripts/benchmark/` (as shown in your `ls` output), you can run it from the root directory by specifying the classpath.

1. **Stay in the Root Directory**
   Ensure you're in `~/projects/lzwjava.github.io`.

2. **Run the Program**
   Use the `-cp` option to point to the directory containing the class file:
   ```bash
   java -cp scripts/benchmark MultiMark
   ```
   - `-cp scripts/benchmark` tells Java to look for classes in the `scripts/benchmark` directory.
   - `MultiMark` is the class name (without `.class` or package prefix, as `MultiMark.java` has no `package` statement).

   This should produce output like:
   ```
   CPU cores: 32
   ...
   ```

3. **Note**: If `MultiMark.class` is outdated or missing, compile the source file first from the root directory:
   ```bash
   javac scripts/benchmark/MultiMark.java
   ```
   Then run the command above.

---

### **Option 2: Run the Source File Directly with Classpath (Java 11+)**
If you prefer running the source file directly (like `python script.py`), you can use the `java` command with the source file path, specifying the classpath.

1. **Stay in the Root Directory**
   Ensure you're in `~/projects/lzwjava.github.io`.

2. **Run the Source File**
   Use:
   ```bash
   java -cp scripts/benchmark scripts/benchmark/MultiMark.java
   ```
   - `-cp scripts/benchmark` sets the classpath to the directory containing the source.
   - `scripts/benchmark/MultiMark.java` specifies the source file to compile and run.

   This compiles and runs `MultiMark.java` in one step, producing the same output as before.

---

### **Option 3: Create a Shell Script in the Root Directory**
To make it even more convenient (like running `./multimark` from the root directory), you can create a shell script in the root directory (`~/projects/lzwjava.github.io`).

1. **Create a Shell Script**
   Create a file named `multimark` in the root directory:
   ```bash
   nano multimark
   ```
   Add:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   java -cp scripts/benchmark MultiMark
   ```
   Save and exit.

2. **Make it Executable**
   ```bash
   chmod +x multimark
   ```

3. **Run the Script**
   From the root directory:
   ```bash
   ./multimark
   ```
   This runs the Java program without needing to change directories.

4. **Optional: Compile in the Script**
   If you want the script to handle compilation (e.g., if the source file changes), modify the script:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   javac scripts/benchmark/MultiMark.java
   java -cp scripts/benchmark MultiMark
   ```

---

### **Key Notes**
- **Classpath (`-cp`)**: The `-cp` option tells Java where to find classes or source files. Since `MultiMark.java` has no `package` statement, the class name is simply `MultiMark`, not `scripts.benchmark.MultiMark`. If it had a `package scripts.benchmark;` line, you’d need to use `java -cp . scripts.benchmark.MultiMark` from the root.
- **Java Version**: The source-file execution (`java scripts/benchmark/MultiMark.java`) requires Java 11 or later. Your system seems to have Java installed, as it worked from the `scripts/benchmark` directory.
- **Directory**: These solutions keep you in the root directory (`~/projects/lzwjava.github.io`), matching your preference.
- **Automation**: The shell script (Option 3) is the closest to a Python-like experience, as you can run `./multimark` like a Python script. You could also add it to your `PATH` for global access, but that’s optional.
- **Error Handling**: If you get errors like `NoClassDefFoundError`, ensure `MultiMark.class` exists in `scripts/benchmark/` or recompile. If Java isn’t found, verify installation (`java --version`).

If you want to integrate this with your Python scripts or need a specific workflow (e.g., running `multimark.py` and `MultiMark.java` together), let me know!
