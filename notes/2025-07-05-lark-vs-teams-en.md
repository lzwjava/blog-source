title: Lark Struggles Against Microsoft Teams
translated: false
---

Lark by ByteDance faces significant challenges in competing with Microsoft Teams primarily due to Microsoft's entrenched position, expansive ecosystem, and strong market dominance. Here's a breakdown of the key factors:

**Microsoft Teams' Strengths and Advantages:**

* **Deep Integration with Microsoft 365 Ecosystem:** This is perhaps the most significant advantage. Microsoft Teams is seamlessly integrated with other widely used Microsoft products like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and SharePoint. For businesses already heavily invested in Microsoft 365, Teams is often included, making it a natural and cost-effective choice. This familiarity and ease of use within an existing workflow are incredibly powerful.
* **Massive User Base and Enterprise Reach:** Microsoft has a vast existing customer base, from small businesses to large enterprises, that have been using their products for decades. Teams leverages this extensive reach and is often the default choice for collaboration within these organizations. Microsoft reported over 320 million monthly active users in 2024.
* **Brand Recognition and Trust:** Microsoft is a globally recognized and trusted brand. This long-standing reputation for reliability, security, and enterprise-grade solutions gives them a significant edge in the business market.
* **Comprehensive Feature Set and Scalability:** Teams offers a robust suite of features for chat, video conferencing, file sharing, and project management. It's designed to scale for organizations of all sizes and offers advanced features like Power Automate integration for complex workflows.
* **Security and Compliance:** Microsoft has a strong focus on enterprise-grade security and compliance, which is crucial for many businesses, especially those in regulated industries.

**Lark's Challenges and Differentiators:**

While Lark offers compelling features, it struggles to overcome Microsoft's dominant position for several reasons:

* **Lack of Established Ecosystem:** Lark, while aiming to be an "all-in-one" superapp, doesn't have the same extensive existing ecosystem of widely adopted business applications as Microsoft. This means businesses might need to integrate Lark with other tools, which can add complexity.
* **Market Share Disparity:** Microsoft Teams holds a significantly larger market share in the collaboration software space. Lark is still relatively new to the global market, especially outside of Asia, and is working to build its user base and brand awareness.
* **User Familiarity and Switching Costs:** Many users and organizations are already accustomed to the Microsoft interface and workflow. Switching to a new platform like Lark, even if it offers some compelling features, involves a learning curve and potential disruption, which can be a barrier to adoption.
* **Perception as a Newer Entrant:** Despite its powerful features, Lark is a newer player in the global collaboration space compared to Microsoft. This can lead to a perception of less maturity or fewer established integrations.

**Where Lark Tries to Compete (and sometimes excels):**

Despite these challenges, Lark does offer some strong competitive advantages:

* **All-in-One Approach:** Lark aims to provide a more integrated experience by combining chat, video conferencing, cloud storage, document collaboration, and automation (like Lark Base for no-code data management) into a single platform, potentially reducing the need to switch between multiple apps.
* **Real-time Translation:** Lark boasts impressive real-time language translation for chats, documents, and even live video conference subtitles, which is a significant benefit for global teams.
* **Generous Free Plan:** Lark offers a more generous free plan (up to 20 users with 100 GB storage) compared to Microsoft Teams' free plan (limited to 1 user and 5 GB storage), making it attractive for small teams and startups.
* **Modern Interface and Ease of Use:** Some users find Lark's interface to be more intuitive and modern than Teams.
* **Strong Automation Capabilities:** Lark's built-in workflow automation tools are designed to be more accessible and deeply integrated, allowing for easier automation of repetitive tasks without extensive technical know-how.

In conclusion, while Lark brings innovative features and a strong "all-in-one" proposition, Microsoft Teams' overwhelming market presence, deep ecosystem integration, and established trust make it a formidable competitor that Lark, as a newer entrant, struggles to displace from its dominant position.
