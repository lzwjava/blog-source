Daniel Lemire is a full professor of computer science at Université TÉLUQ, specializing in software performance and indexing techniques in data science. He is highly recognized in his field, being among the top 2% of most cited scientists in the world (Stanford University rankings, 2024) and among the top 0.0006% most followed programmers on GitHub.

His work has made significant contributions to computer systems and is widely adopted by major tech companies. Some of his notable contributions include:

* **simdjson parser:** The first software library capable of processing JSON data at gigabytes per second. It's used by companies like Facebook, Shopify, Intel, Microsoft, and Node.js.
* **Roaring Bitmaps:** A standard for data analysis used by Google (for YouTube), Uber, Microsoft, and Wikipedia, among others. It's an efficient alternative to older formats like EWAH.
* **Ada library:** A very fast URL parser that has significantly improved performance in environments like Node.js and is adopted by Cloudflare, Redpanda, Zoom, and Telegram.
* **simdutf:** A software library for Unicode operations that is six to ten times faster than conventional methods.
* **fast_float:** An implementation of C++ `from_chars` functions that parses floating-point numbers significantly faster than conventional methods.

Daniel Lemire is also a strong advocate for free software and knowledge democratization, making his work and tools openly available. He maintains a popular computer blog where he frequently publishes posts and engages with the international community.

He holds a Postdoctorate from the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, a Ph.D. in Engineering Mathematics from the University of Montreal and Polytechnique Montréal, a Master in Mathematics, and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Toronto.
