### Key Points
- It seems likely that the course "Linear Algebra 02198" in Guangdong’s self-study exam system covers standard undergraduate topics, but the exact syllabus is not publicly available online in English.
- Research suggests the course includes systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, vector spaces, and eigenvalues, based on typical Chinese self-study curricula.
- The evidence leans toward a 2–3 hour written exam format, with a passing score around 60/100, though specifics may vary by province.

### Course Overview
The course "Linear Algebra 02198" is likely designed for undergraduate students, particularly those in science, engineering, or mathematics, focusing on fundamental concepts and practical applications. It seems to aim at equipping self-study learners with theoretical understanding and problem-solving skills, given the nature of China’s self-study exam system.

### Expected Topics
Based on standard Linear Algebra courses in China, the syllabus probably includes:
- Introduction to Linear Algebra, covering scalars, vectors, and matrices.
- Systems of linear equations, including Gaussian elimination and solutions.
- Matrix operations, such as addition, multiplication, transpose, and inverses.
- Determinants, their computation, and applications like Cramer’s Rule.
- Vector spaces, including subspaces, basis, dimension, and linear independence.
- Linear transformations, focusing on kernel, image, and properties like injectivity.
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, with applications in areas like stability analysis.
- Possibly inner product spaces and real-world applications, though these may vary.

### Assessment Details
The assessment is likely a written exam lasting 2–3 hours, consisting of multiple-choice, short-answer, and problem-solving questions, with the final test accounting for 100% of the grade. The passing score is typically around 60/100, but this may differ in Guangdong.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Linear Algebra 02198 in Guangdong Self-Study Exam

This section provides a comprehensive exploration of the course "Linear Algebra 02198" within the context of Guangdong’s self-study exam system, also known as the Self-Taught Higher Education Examination (STHEE) in China. Despite extensive research, the exact syllabus for course code 02198 could not be located online, particularly in English, leading to the construction of a general outline based on standard curricula and educational practices in China. Below, we detail the methodology, findings, and implications, ensuring a thorough understanding for self-study learners and educators.

#### Background on China’s Self-Study Exam System
China’s self-study exam system, established under the Higher Education Law of the People’s Republic of China (adopted in 1998), allows adults to pursue higher education independently, with examinations managed by provincial educational authorities ([Self-Taught Higher Education Examinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Taught_Higher_Education_Examinations)). The system offers two levels: specialized (equivalent to two- or three-year programs) and undergraduate (equivalent to four-year programs), with courses varying by region and examiner university. Guangdong, as a province, organizes and manages its STHEE through the Guangdong Education Examination Authority, but specific course details are not readily accessible online in English.

#### Search for Specific Syllabus
Efforts to locate the syllabus for Linear Algebra 02198 included searching for Guangdong’s self-study exam course catalog, the provincial education authority’s website ([Department of Education of Guangdong Province](https://edu.gd.gov.cn/English/InternalDepartments/index.html)), and related educational resources. Searches for "Guangdong self-study exam course list," "Guangdong self-study exam syllabus Linear Algebra 02198," and "China self-study exam course code 02198" yielded general information about the system but no specific syllabus for the course code. It is possible that such information is available in Chinese on official portals, such as [http://eea.gd.gov.cn/](http://eea.gd.gov.cn/), which was referenced but not accessible for detailed English content.

#### General Outline Construction
Given the lack of specific information, a general outline was constructed based on standard Linear Algebra curricula in China, particularly those used in self-study contexts. Textbooks like *Linear Algebra* by Tongji University Press and *Introduction to Linear Algebra* by Gilbert Strang (translated editions) are commonly recommended, suggesting a focus on foundational topics. The outline aligns with typical undergraduate courses, emphasizing theoretical understanding and practical applications, as is standard for STHEE.

#### Detailed Course Outline
The following table summarizes the likely topics for Linear Algebra 02198, based on educational standards:

| **Section**               | **Topics**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Introduction           | Definition, importance, scalars, vectors, matrices, applications in science, engineering, economics |
| 2. Systems of Equations   | Representation, Gaussian elimination, row reduction, solutions (unique, infinite, none), homogeneous vs. non-homogeneous |
| 3. Matrices and Operations| Notation, types (square, identity, zero), addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, transpose, inverse |
| 4. Determinants           | Definition, computation (2x2, 3x3, higher), properties, applications (e.g., Cramer’s Rule) |
| 5. Vector Spaces          | Definition, subspaces, basis, dimension, linear independence, span, coordinates, change of basis |
| 6. Linear Transformations | Definition, examples, matrix representation, kernel, image, properties (injectivity, surjectivity) |
| 7. Eigenvalues and Vectors| Characteristic polynomial, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, diagonalization, applications (stability, Markov processes) |
| 8. Inner Product Spaces   | Dot product, norms, orthogonality, orthonormal bases, Gram-Schmidt process (optional) |
| 9. Applications           | Real-world problems (network flows, data fitting), computational methods (matrices in programming) |

This outline is tentative, as Guangdong’s syllabus might include additional topics or exclude some, such as inner product spaces, which could be reserved for higher-level courses.

#### Assessment and Learning Resources
Assessment for STHEE courses typically involves a written exam lasting 2–3 hours, with formats including multiple-choice, short-answer, and problem-solving questions, accounting for 100% of the grade. The passing score is usually around 60/100, though this may vary by province. Suggested learning resources include:
- Textbooks: *Linear Algebra* by Tongji University Press, *Introduction to Linear Algebra* by Gilbert Strang ([available in translated editions](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0980232775)).
- Practice problems from past Guangdong self-study exam papers, though specific papers were not located.
- Online platforms like China Open Resources for Education (CORE), which may offer lecture notes and supplementary materials.

Prerequisites likely include basic high school mathematics, such as algebra and trigonometry, and familiarity with mathematical proofs, aligning with the self-study nature of the system.

#### Implications and Limitations
The self-study exam system is designed for independent learners, assuming mastery without formal instruction. This makes the course challenging but accessible to adults with valid ID cards, requiring no formal schooling certificate ([Education in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_China)). However, the lack of accessible English documentation poses a barrier for international learners or researchers. The outline provided is a best estimate, and for exact details, consulting the Guangdong Education Examination Institute’s official website ([http://eea.gd.gov.cn/](http://eea.gd.gov.cn/)) in Chinese is recommended.

#### Conclusion
While the exact syllabus for Linear Algebra 02198 remains elusive, this general outline should serve as a robust guide for self-study learners in Guangdong, covering essential topics and assessment formats. Future research could explore accessing provincial resources in Chinese or contacting educational authorities for precise curricula.
