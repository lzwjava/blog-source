Yes — China’s immigration authority does provide a WeChat/Alipay mini program named “移民局” (often associated with “12367”) that lets you **view and download** your entry/exit (出入境) records for up to 10 years. ([canachieve.net][1])

Here’s how it works, and whether it might be accepted by Hong Kong banks:

## What the “移民局/12367” mini program supports

* You can search in WeChat (or Alipay) for the “移民局” mini program (sometimes with “12367” suffix) to access Chinese immigration services. ([nia.gov.cn][2])
* After opening the mini program, there is a “出入境记录查询” (entry/exit record query) option under the “中国公民服务” section. ([canachieve.net][1])
* You provide: name, document type (passport / travel permit / Hong Kong–Macau travel permit), document number, and perform identity verification (face recognition). ([gaj.gz.gov.cn][3])
* The mini program lets you **download** the result as an electronic file (PDF) and send it to your email. The downloaded record carries an **electronic signature / seal** from the immigration authority. ([canachieve.net][1])
* The system supports querying records for various documents — not only your China passport, but also your Hong Kong/Macau travel permit, etc. ([gaj.gz.gov.cn][3])
* The records retrieved via the mini program are limited to the **most recent 10 years**. ([canachieve.net][1])
* If you have **no** entry/exit events in that period, the system may not produce a downloadable file. In such cases, it’s advised to go to a border control office in person for a proof record. ([nia.gov.cn][4])

## Could HK banks accept this as “proof of travel / border record”?

Potentially yes — but whether they will **accept it** depends on the bank’s internal compliance / KYC policies. Here are factors to consider:

### Advantages of using the mini program export

* The file is **official** (issued by the immigration authority, with e-signature) and good as proof that you’ve traveled (or not) in the past 10 years.
* It provides a **digital, verifiable** record, which is more convenient than getting physical certificates from immigration offices.
* It covers Hong Kong/Macau travel permit movements too (if the travel permit is one of your documents used in the query).

### Possible issues / bank objections

* Some banks may require a **physical, stamped document** from a Hong Kong authority (or local immigration) rather than a Chinese domestic e-record.
* If your travel permit or endorsement is not reflected (expired, invalid, etc.), the mini program record may omit some entries or show gaps.
* The bank may query beyond 10 years — but the mini program only supports 10 years.
* The bank may check whether the electronic signature / formatting is acceptable to them. They may ask for additional verification (e.g. from immigration office, or physical document).

If you like, I can check specific Hong Kong banks (like CMB Wing Lung, ZA Bank, HSBC, etc.) and see whether any of them officially accept the WeChat “移民局” mini program export as valid travel record proof in 2025. Do you want me to check that?
