Didi (operating primarily through its 99 brand in Brazil) is in a strong growth phase as of late 2025, with significant expansions in both ride-hailing and food delivery services. The company acquired 99 in 2018, and while ride-hailing remains a core offering available nationwide, much of the recent buzz centers on the relaunch and rapid scaling of its 99Food delivery platform.

### Key Updates:
- **Food Delivery Relaunch and Expansion**: After a two-year pause, 99Food resumed operations in April 2025. It's now trialing in Rio de Janeiro (launched October 17) following earlier rollouts in Goiânia and São Paulo. Plans include reaching 15 cities by year-end and 100 total by mid-2026, backed by a R$2 billion (~$377 million) investment commitment through June 2026.
- **Ride-Hailing Stability**: 99 continues to dominate as a major Uber competitor, with no major disruptions reported. The focus on food delivery is leveraging the existing rider network for cross-selling.
- **Challenges**: There's ongoing competition from rivals like Meituan's Keeta (launching in São Paulo by late 2025), leading to legal skirmishes. In August, Didi sued Keeta over alleged poaching, and a court recently blocked 99Food's exclusive restaurant deals to promote fair play.

Overall, Didi's trajectory in Brazil looks bullish, with heavy investments signaling confidence in the market's potential amid Brazil's growing digital economy.
