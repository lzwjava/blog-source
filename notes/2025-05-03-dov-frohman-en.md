Dov Frohman (born March 28, 1939, in Amsterdam, Netherlands) is an Israeli electrical engineer, inventor, business executive, and a pivotal figure in the global semiconductor industry. Renowned for inventing the erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) and founding Intel Israel, Frohman’s contributions have significantly shaped modern computing and Israel’s high-tech economy. His life, marked by resilience, innovation, and leadership, reflects a blend of technical brilliance and a commitment to fostering technological advancement in challenging environments. He is also the co-author of the influential book *Leadership the Hard Way* (2008), which distills his unconventional leadership philosophy.

### Early Life and Education
Frohman’s early life was shaped by adversity. Born to Polish Jewish parents, Abraham and Feijga Frohman, who had fled antisemitism in Poland for the Netherlands, he was separated from them during World War II. In 1942, at age three, his parents entrusted him to the Dutch resistance to escape Nazi persecution. He was hidden by the Van Tilborghs, an orthodox Christian farming family in Sprang-Capelle, Netherlands, while his parents perished in the Holocaust. After the war, Frohman spent time in orphanages for Jewish children in Palestine before emigrating to Israel in 1949, following the establishment of the Jewish state. Adopted by relatives in Tel Aviv, he grew up in a new homeland and served in the Israeli army.

His fascination with electronics led him to study electrical engineering at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, where he earned his bachelor’s degree in 1963. Seeking advanced opportunities, Frohman moved to the United States, enrolling at the University of California, Berkeley. There, he completed a master’s degree in electrical engineering (1965) and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science (1969), laying the groundwork for his career in semiconductor technology.

### Career and Innovations
Frohman’s professional journey began in 1965 at Fairchild Semiconductor in Palo Alto, California, where he worked in the research and development group, focusing on integrated circuits and nonvolatile memory devices. In 1969, he joined Intel Corporation, a fledgling startup founded by former Fairchild colleagues Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Andrew Grove. At Intel, Frohman tackled a quality-control issue with the 1101 static random-access memory (SRAM), Intel’s first mass-produced chip using metal-oxide semiconductor technology. His investigation led to a groundbreaking discovery in 1970: the EPROM, the first nonvolatile semiconductor memory that was both erasable and easily reprogrammable.

The EPROM revolutionized computing by addressing a critical limitation of existing memory technologies. Unlike volatile RAM, which lost data without power, or ROM, which required time-consuming factory programming, EPROM allowed developers to program and erase memory in minutes using ultraviolet light. Unveiled in 1971 at the Solid-State Circuits Conference in Philadelphia, the EPROM reduced chip prototype design time from weeks to hours, becoming a cornerstone of microprocessor-based systems. Intel co-founder Gordon Moore described it as “as important in the development of the microcomputer industry as the microprocessor itself.” The EPROM’s synergy with Intel’s microprocessor business fueled the growth of personal computers and industrial controls, and its principles underpin modern flash memory used in devices like USB drives and SSDs.

### Founding Intel Israel
Driven by a vision to bring high-tech innovation to Israel, Frohman played a central role in establishing Intel’s presence there. In 1974, he convinced Intel’s leadership to open a small chip design center in Haifa, the company’s first R&D facility outside the United States. This move capitalized on the Technion’s engineering talent and marked a bold investment in a country then known more for agriculture than technology. Frohman balanced this effort with an academic role, teaching applied physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and serving as director of its School of Applied Science and Technology (1975–1980).

In 1985, after negotiating with the Israeli government, Frohman oversaw the establishment of Intel’s first overseas semiconductor fabrication plant in Jerusalem. As general manager of Intel Israel from 1981 and later vice president of Intel’s Microprocessor Products Group, he transformed Intel Israel into a flagship operation. Under his leadership, Intel Israel designed key technologies, including the microprocessor for IBM’s original PC and the Centrino mobile computing technology. Frohman expanded Intel’s footprint with a second fabrication plant in Kiryat Gat in 1995, which became a major center for chip manufacturing. By 2007, Intel Israel’s exports reached $1.4 billion, accounting for 8.5% of Israel’s electronics and information industry exports.

A defining moment came during the 1991 Gulf War, when Iraq launched Scud missiles at Israel. Despite the Israeli Civil Defense authority’s recommendation to close non-essential businesses due to fears of chemical attacks, Frohman kept Intel Israel operational. This decision, detailed in a 2006 *Harvard Business Review* article, ensured continuity and reinforced Intel Israel’s reputation for resilience, making it the only manufacturing business in Israel to remain open throughout the conflict.

### Leadership Philosophy and *Leadership the Hard Way*
Frohman’s leadership style, shaped by his experiences in turbulent environments, is captured in his 2008 book *Leadership the Hard Way*, co-authored with Robert Howard. The book argues that leadership cannot be taught but must be learned through courage, risk-taking, and navigating uncertainty. Frohman emphasizes nonconformity, embracing dissent, and fostering a “culture of survival” with slogans like “Be the Best” and “Do the Impossible.” Praised by figures like Andy Grove and Tom Peters, the book offers a candid perspective on leading in high-stakes settings, drawing from Frohman’s decisions—from inventing the EPROM to keeping Intel Israel open during wartime.

### Awards and Recognition
Frohman’s contributions have earned him numerous accolades:
- **1982**: IEEE Jack Morton Award for achievements in solid-state devices.
- **1991**: Israel Prize for Engineering and Technology, recognizing his impact on Israel’s high-tech sector.
- **2008**: IEEE Edison Medal for a career of meritorious achievement in electrical engineering.
- **2009**: Induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for the EPROM invention.
- **2018**: Named a Fellow of the Computer History Museum.

He is also a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities.

### Personal Life and Legacy
After retiring from Intel in 2001, Frohman has divided his time between homes in Jerusalem and Selva di Cadore, Italy. An unconventional figure, he is known for his maverick persona—riding a Suzuki dirt bike and enjoying adventure travel, such as helicopter drops into the Alaskan wilderness. His academic stints, including a year as a visiting professor at the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana (1972–1973), reflect his global outlook and commitment to education.

Frohman’s legacy is profound. The EPROM laid the foundation for modern nonvolatile memory, enabling technologies that power everyday devices. Intel Israel, under his stewardship, became a cornerstone of Israel’s high-tech economy, transforming the country into a global innovation hub. His leadership principles continue to inspire executives navigating complex, uncertain environments. As Yossi Vardi, a prominent Israeli tech investor, noted, Frohman’s work embodies “the human spirit and how high it can soar,” cementing his status as a pioneer of both technology and leadership.[](https://www.leadershipthehardway.com/MeetTheAuthors.html)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Frohman)[](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/09208)
