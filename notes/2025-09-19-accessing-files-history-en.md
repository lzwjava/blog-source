### Understanding the Scenario
It seems you're describing a situation where company Python (.py) files can't be directly opened or viewed due to restrictions in a controlled environment (e.g., "big tech" company systems with security policies blocking access). As a workaround, you're suggesting using an enterprise GitHub instance to access the files indirectly through commit history, directory details, and change logs. This is a legitimate approach in many corporate setups where GitHub Enterprise is used for version control, and repository access is governed by permissions. I'll explain how this works step-by-step, why it's effective, and any caveats, based on standard Git and GitHub practices.

### Step-by-Step Explanation of Accessing Files via GitHub Commit History
GitHub stores a full history of changes for each file in a repository's commits, including past versions, diffs (differences), and directory structures. Even if direct file access is restricted, users with repository read permissions (common in enterprise environments) can review changes. This doesn't "bypass" restrictions but leverages authorized GitHub access for auditing or review.

1. **Access the Repository on Enterprise GitHub**:
   - Log in to your company's GitHub Enterprise instance (e.g., at a domain like `github.company.com`).
   - Navigate to the relevant repository (e.g., the one containing the Python files). Ensure you have at least read access; if not, request it from a repository admin or IT.

2. **Explore Commit History**:
   - Go to the repository's main page.
   - Click on the "Commits" tab (or use the "History" view if available).
   - This shows a chronological list of commits, each with details like author, timestamp, commit message, and changed files.
   - Search for commits that reference the Python file(s) of interest (e.g., filter by filename like `example.py` in the search bar).

3. **Find the File's Directory and View Changes**:
   - In a commit, click on the commit SHA (the long alphanumeric code) to open the commit details.
   - Here, you'll see:
     - **Changed Files List**: A summary of files modified in that commit, including paths ( directories).
     - **File Directory**: The full path is shown, e.g., `src/module/example.py`, revealing hierarchical structure (folder names up to the file).
     - **Diff View**: Click on a changed file to see the "diff" – additions, deletions, and context lines. This allows you to:
       - View the old version (left side) vs. new version (right side).
       - See entire file contents for that commit if you select the file link.
       - For Python files, you can inspect code snippets, functions, or logic changes without needing direct file access.
   - To find a file's directory specifically:
     - Use the repository's "Browse" or "Code" tab and navigate folders.
     - Or, in commit details, the "Changed files" section lists paths like `/python/scripts/analysis.py`, making directories clear.

4. **Viewing Historical Versions or Full Histories**:
   - Click "Browse at this point" in the commit view to see the entire repository as it was after that commit, including directory structure and file contents.
   - For deeper history, use "Blame" view (under the file's options) to see who changed which lines and when.
   - If the file was moved/renamed, Git tracks that, so historical paths are traceable via diffs.

### Why This Works and Its Benefits
- **Evidence/Reasoning**: GitHub uses Git under the hood, which stores every file version in its commit tree. When you clone or view a repo locally in the restricted environment, the commit history includes compressed file states – GitHub exposes this via its web UI. For example, public GitHub repos (e.g., open-source projects) let anyone view commits freely; enterprise versions enforce permissions but allow the same features if authorized. This is standard for code review in secure setups, per Git documentation (git-scm.com/docs).
- **Use Cases**: This is ideal for debugging, audits, or understanding changes without running restricted code. In big tech-like environments, it complies with security (e.g., no direct execution) while enabling collaboration.
- **Tools/Alternatives**:
  - **Git CLI**: If you can clone the repo locally (with permissions), run commands like `git log --oneline -p filename.py` to see diff history, or `git ls-tree -r HEAD` for directory listing.
  - **GitHub Web Features**: Use "All changes" in PRs or filters like `filename:path/to/file.py` in the search bar to quickly locate files.
  - Limitations: Large files might be diff-truncated; binary files (not pure text like Python) show limited diffs. You can't modify files this way – only view historical data.

### Potential Drawbacks and Best Practices
- **Permissions and Security**: This assumes you have legitimate access. Attempting to view repos without authorization could violate company policies or laws – always confirm with IT or repo owners.
- **Restrictions in Big Tech Environments**: Some orgs use GitHub's "repository restrictions" or firewalls; if enterprise GitHub is blocked, this won't work. Encrypted or sensitive files might still be off-limits if repo access is denied.
- **Optimization Tip**: For large repos, enable notifications or use GitHub's blame/merge views to focus on key changes efficiently.
