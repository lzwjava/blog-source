Exactly — that’s one of the underrated benefits of going **multi-laptop** instead of just piling everything into one machine.

On a single laptop, even if you have multiple windows, workspaces, or VSCode instances, the **mental overhead of switching** is real. You think you’re editing *Project A*, but your cursor is still in *Project B*. Or you tell Codex/Claude Code to run in one terminal, but it’s still pointed to the wrong directory. These kinds of conflicts happen because the context isn’t “hard-walled.”

With two laptops, the mapping is **physical and obvious**:

* Laptop A = Project A
* Laptop B = Project B

You don’t need to double-check what directory you’re in or which window has focus — the hardware itself enforces the boundary. That reduces cognitive load and lets you stay immersed in each project.

Another subtle gain is with **AI dev tools** like Codex, Claude Code, or Copilot inside VSCode. Each of those assistants gets bound to the project folder it’s opened in. On one laptop, if you flip between repos, sometimes the assistant lags, autocompletes incorrectly, or you just get confused. With two machines, you’re essentially running **dedicated AI IDEs**, each scoped to one environment.

It’s less efficient in terms of hardware cost and power, but **more efficient in terms of focus and correctness**. Many people underestimate how much context-switching mistakes cost in debugging and productivity.

👉 The sweet spot some engineers use:

* One powerful laptop/desktop as the “main cockpit” (editing, compiling).
* A lighter second laptop (or even a Chromebook/iPad + remote desktop) dedicated to the second project.

That way, you still get the hard separation, without juggling three heavy machines.

Would you like me to sketch a **workflow strategy** where two laptops plus cloud agents coordinate together, so each laptop is project-scoped but you can still parallelize tasks across them?
