Over the last decade, there have been several high-profile business failures and bankruptcies that shook industries. Some of the most notable include:

### 1. **Toys "R" Us (2017)**
   - **Industry**: Retail
   - **Reason**: Toys "R" Us filed for bankruptcy in 2017 due to mounting debt, changing consumer preferences, and intense competition from online retailers like Amazon. The company couldn’t adapt to the rise of e-commerce, leading to a steep decline in sales.

### 2. **Blockbuster (2010s)**
   - **Industry**: Video Rental/Entertainment
   - **Reason**: Blockbuster, once the giant in video rental, failed to adapt to the shift towards streaming services and on-demand entertainment, particularly Netflix. By the time Blockbuster attempted to pivot, it was too late.

### 3. **Lehman Brothers (2008)**
   - **Industry**: Financial Services
   - **Reason**: Lehman Brothers, one of the largest investment banks in the world, filed for bankruptcy in 2008 due to exposure to subprime mortgage-backed securities and risky financial products. The bankruptcy played a significant role in triggering the global financial crisis.

### 4. **Carillion (2018)**
   - **Industry**: Construction and Infrastructure
   - **Reason**: The UK-based construction and facilities management company collapsed due to poor financial management, overleveraging, and an inability to deliver on major contracts. Its bankruptcy resulted in massive losses for creditors and workers.

### 5. **Hertz (2020)**
   - **Industry**: Car Rental
   - **Reason**: The pandemic severely affected the travel and transportation industry. Hertz, already burdened with debt, filed for bankruptcy in 2020 due to a massive drop in car rentals during the COVID-19 pandemic and the inability to meet financial obligations.

### 6. **J.C. Penney (2020)**
   - **Industry**: Retail
   - **Reason**: J.C. Penney filed for bankruptcy in 2020 after years of declining sales, partly due to the rise of e-commerce and changing shopping habits. The pandemic only exacerbated the situation as malls and stores were forced to close.

### 7. **Wirecard (2020)**
   - **Industry**: Fintech
   - **Reason**: Wirecard, a German payments company, was involved in a massive accounting scandal, with billions in fraudulent transactions. It filed for insolvency after revealing it had overstated its balance sheet by €1.9 billion. This scandal had widespread repercussions on the fintech industry.

### 8. **Kodak (2012)**
   - **Industry**: Photography/Imaging
   - **Reason**: Kodak, which once dominated the photography industry, filed for bankruptcy in 2012 due to its inability to transition from film to digital technology. Despite pioneering digital imaging technology, it was too slow to adapt, and its core business eroded as smartphones became the primary camera.

### 9. **General Electric (GE) (2017)**
   - **Industry**: Conglomerate
   - **Reason**: GE faced a severe decline, with issues in its financial services and industrial operations. The company struggled with high debt and mismanagement. GE’s stock price dropped significantly, and the company was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2018.

### 10. **Fyre Festival (2017)**
   - **Industry**: Event Planning
   - **Reason**: The Fyre Festival was marketed as a luxury music festival, but it was an outright disaster. The organizers were accused of fraud, mismanagement, and failing to deliver any of the promised services. The festival never took place, and the incident led to lawsuits and the eventual bankruptcy of the organizers.

These companies or events highlight how various factors—failure to innovate, mismanagement, debt, market disruption, and external shocks (like the pandemic)—can lead to significant business collapse.
