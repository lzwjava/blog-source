### Explanation
- **Subprocess**: Uses `subprocess.Popen` to run `mvn clean compile` (adjust the command as needed; for simple `mvn build`, it might be `['mvn', 'build']` or wrapped in `cmd /c` if needed). It's run asynchronously with pipes for stdout and stderr.
- **Queue Threading**: A separate thread reads from stdout and stderr line by line (to avoid reading entire output at once), decodes it, and puts lines into a `queue.Queue`. This allows non-blocking reads.
- **Timeout Monitoring**: In the main thread, check the queue for new output with `get(timeout=10)`. If no output arrives in 10 seconds, terminate the subprocess and exit.
- **Windows Compatibility**: `subprocess` works on Windows. If the command requires a shell (e.g., for `mvn` if not in PATH), you could set `shell=True` and pass the command as a string: `proc = subprocess.Popen("mvn clean compile", shell=True, ...)`.
- **Edge Cases**: If the process exits normally while waiting, the loop stops and we join the thread. The thread is daemonic to avoid hanging on exit.
- **Customization**: You can modify to process outputs differently (e.g., log to file instead of print). For stderr, it's combined into the same queue; you could separate if needed. If outputs are binary, adjust decoding.
