For storing vegetables like potatoes, peppers, onions, bitter melons, and ginger in the refrigerator's fresh food compartment, the ideal temperature range is **2°C to 8°C**. Here's a breakdown tailored to these vegetables:

- **Recommended Temperature: 4°C to 6°C**
  - **Peppers and Bitter Melons**: These thrive at around 5°C, maintaining crispness and flavor without freezing.
  - **Ginger**: Less sensitive to temperature, ginger can be stored at 4°C to 8°C, preferably in a warmer part of the fridge (e.g., vegetable crisper).
  - **Onions and Potatoes**: These are ideally stored at cooler room temperatures (10°C-15°C) in a dry, ventilated area, as refrigeration can cause potatoes to convert starch to sugar (affecting taste) and onions to absorb moisture and mold. If refrigerated, place them in the warmer part of the fridge (closer to 8°C) using breathable bags (e.g., paper bags) to avoid moisture buildup.

- **Tips**:
  - **Humidity Control**: Use the vegetable crisper with medium to high humidity (80%-90%) for peppers and bitter melons. Onions and ginger prefer lower humidity to stay dry.
  - **Separate Storage**: Keep onions away from potatoes, as onions release ethylene gas, which can cause potatoes to sprout.
  - **Avoid Over-Chilling**: Below 2°C, vegetables like peppers and bitter melons may suffer chill damage, showing soft spots or discoloration.

### Storing Potatoes and Onions at 25°C in Guangzhou
In Guangzhou’s warm (25°C) and humid climate, storing potatoes and onions without refrigeration is challenging due to accelerated spoilage and sprouting. Here’s an analysis:

#### Potatoes
- **Challenges**: At 25°C, potatoes are prone to sprouting or turning green (producing toxic solanine). High humidity in Guangzhou can also cause softening or rot.
- **Storage Tips**:
  - **Environment**: Store in a cool, shaded, well-ventilated area (e.g., away from sunlight in a cupboard).
  - **Container**: Use breathable paper or mesh bags to prevent moisture buildup. Avoid plastic bags.
  - **Shelf Life**: At 25°C, potatoes may last 2-4 weeks, depending on humidity. Check regularly for sprouts or soft spots.
  - **Refrigeration Alternative**: If the environment is too humid, store in the fridge (4°C-8°C, preferably closer to 8°C) in paper bags to extend shelf life to 1-2 months, though taste may slightly sweeten.

#### Onions
- **Challenges**: Onions are sensitive to humidity, and at 25°C in Guangzhou’s climate, they may mold, soften, or sprout quickly.
- **Storage Tips**:
  - **Environment**: Store in a cool, dry, well-ventilated spot, away from potatoes to avoid ethylene-induced sprouting.
  - **Container**: Use mesh bags or baskets for air circulation. Avoid sealed plastic bags.
  - **Shelf Life**: At 25°C, onions may last 2-4 weeks. Check for mold or softness regularly.
  - **Refrigeration Alternative**: If humidity is high, refrigerate at 4°C-8°C in paper bags to extend shelf life to 1-2 months.

#### Additional Tips for Guangzhou’s Climate
- **Humidity Control**: Use desiccants (e.g., bamboo charcoal) in storage areas to reduce moisture, especially critical in humid conditions.
- **Separate Storage**: Keep potatoes and onions apart to prevent spoilage.
- **Regular Checks**: Inspect weekly for sprouting or rot, especially in humid conditions.
- **Refrigeration Preference**: At 25°C with high humidity, refrigeration (4°C-8°C) is more reliable for longer storage, especially for onions.

### Summary
Set the refrigerator’s fresh food compartment to **4°C to 6°C** for optimal storage of peppers, bitter melons, and ginger, using high-humidity crispers. For onions and potatoes, if refrigerated, use the warmer part (closer to 8°C) with breathable bags. At 25°C in Guangzhou’s humid climate, potatoes and onions can be stored for 2-4 weeks in a cool, ventilated, dry spot with paper or mesh bags, but refrigeration is recommended for longer preservation due to the high humidity. Regular checks and moisture control are key.
