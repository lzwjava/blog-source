It seems like you're asking about tech professionals who enjoy sailing (帆船, which means "sailboat" in Japanese) as a hobby. Since I don’t have real-time access to personal data about individuals and their hobbies, I’ll provide some examples of notable tech figures who are known to have an interest in sailing, based on publicly available information up to my last update. I’ll also explain how sailing aligns with the interests of many tech professionals.

### Notable Tech Figures Who Enjoy Sailing
1. **Larry Ellison**  
   - **Tech Background**: Co-founder of Oracle Corporation, a major enterprise software company.
   - **Sailing Connection**: Ellison is a well-known sailing enthusiast. He won the America’s Cup in 2010 and 2013 with his team, Oracle Team USA. His passion for sailing is tied to his competitive nature, and he has invested heavily in yacht racing, including designing high-tech boats with cutting-edge technology—perfect for a tech mogul.
   - **Why Sailing?**: Sailing combines strategy, engineering, and a love for the outdoors, which appeals to someone with a mind for innovation and problem-solving.

2. **Sergey Brin**  
   - **Tech Background**: Co-founder of Google, a pioneer in search engine technology and AI.
   - **Sailing Connection**: While Brin is more famously associated with kiteboarding and other extreme sports, there have been reports of him enjoying time on luxury yachts and engaging in water-based activities. Sailing aligns with his adventurous personality and access to resources for such hobbies.
   - **Why Sailing?**: The freedom and technical aspects of sailing might resonate with his creative and exploratory mindset.

3. **Ori Lahav**  
   - **Tech Background**: Co-founder and CTO of Outbrain, a content recommendation platform.
   - **Sailing Connection**: Lahav is an avid sailor who organizes an annual sailing trip in Greece for tech entrepreneurs to network and exchange ideas. He uses these trips to blend his love for sailing with his professional life, supporting a nonprofit in the process.
   - **Why Sailing?**: For Lahav, sailing is both a personal passion and a way to build community, reflecting the collaborative yet independent spirit of tech innovators.

4. **Paul Allen (Deceased)**  
   - **Tech Background**: Co-founder of Microsoft, instrumental in the personal computing revolution.
   - **Sailing Connection**: Allen owned several massive yachts, including the famous *Octopus*, a 414-foot vessel equipped with advanced technology. While he didn’t race competitively like Ellison, his love for the sea and sailing was evident in his lifestyle.
   - **Why Sailing?**: His interest in exploration (he funded deep-sea expeditions) and technology likely drew him to the engineering marvels of modern yachts.

### Why Tech Professionals Might Enjoy Sailing
Sailing is a hobby that naturally attracts tech-minded individuals for several reasons:
- **Problem-Solving**: Navigating a sailboat requires understanding wind patterns, currents, and equipment—skills that parallel coding or system design.
- **Technology Integration**: Modern sailing involves advanced materials (e.g., carbon fiber) and electronics (e.g., GPS, weather forecasting tools), appealing to those who love gadgets and innovation.
- **Balance of Work and Leisure**: Many tech professionals, especially those in high-stress roles, seek hobbies like sailing to unplug and enjoy nature while still engaging their analytical minds.
- **Community and Networking**: Sailing clubs and events (like Lahav’s trips) provide opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals, a trait valued in the tech world.

### Finding More Examples
Since my knowledge is broad but not exhaustive on this specific niche, you could explore tech communities or platforms like X to find more current examples. For instance, posting a question like, “Which tech professionals are into sailing?” might uncover lesser-known figures who share this hobby. Alternatively, tech conferences near coastal areas sometimes feature sailing outings, hinting at its popularity among the crowd.
