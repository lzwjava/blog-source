### Top Restaurants in Guangzhou (2025)

Guangzhou, known as the "Millennium Banquet City," boasts a vibrant food scene heavily influenced by Cantonese cuisine, dim sum, and innovative fusion. Based on the latest Michelin Guide 2025, here are the standout restaurants. I've focused on the highest-rated (Two Stars) and a selection of One Star spots for variety, prioritizing those with strong reviews for authenticity and experience. Prices are generally high-end (¥¥¥+), but reservations are essential.

#### Two Michelin Stars
These represent exceptional consistency and creativity.

| Restaurant | Cuisine | Location | Highlights |
|------------|---------|----------|------------|
| Imperial Treasure Fine Chinese Cuisine | Cantonese | Tianhe District | Signature dim sum and seafood dishes in an opulent setting; renowned for refined flavors. |
| Jiang by Chef Fei | Cantonese | Tianhe District (Mandarin Oriental) | Modern twists on classics like roasted goose; seven-time Two Star recipient. |
| Taian Table | European Contemporary | Yuexiu District (Garden Hotel) | Chef Richard Ng's tasting menus blending French techniques with local ingredients. |

#### One Michelin Stars (Selected Top Picks)
From 17 total, these are favorites for first-time visitors, covering dim sum, regional specialties, and international flair.

#### Beyond Stars: Bib Gourmand and Local Favorites
For value-driven eats (Bib Gourmand: good quality, moderate prices):
- **Da Ge Fan**: Claypot rice specialist; hearty, affordable Cantonese comfort food (Michelin Recommended).
- **Chao Ji Claypot Rice (Liwan)**: Street-style rice pots with local vibes.

For trendy spots (from World's 50 Best Discovery):
- **Hope & Sesame**: Creative Cantonese bar bites and cocktails.
- **SanYou**: Modern teahouse with innovative dim sum.

Pro tip: Visit during the Canton Fair season for bustling energy, but book ahead via apps like Dianping. For casual dim sum, head to older districts like Liwan.
