This is the personal homepage of Dana N. Xu, a junior Research Scientist (Chargé de Recherche) in the Gallium research team at INRIA Paris - Rocquencourt, a French national research institute focused on computer science.

The page serves as a simple hub for her professional and personal updates rather than a full blog or detailed CV. Key elements include:
- **News/Updates**: Recent highlights, such as a project on "Hybrid Contract Checking for OCaml" (a research effort involving programming languages and verification), a note that she's currently on extended leave and based in Beijing, and a quirky mention of job application challenges at certain research centers.
- **Blog Link**: It points to her actual blog at [danaxu.blogspot.com](http://danaxu.blogspot.com/), titled "Dreaming, Thinking ...," which seems to be where she shares more reflective or ongoing thoughts.
- **Personal Touches**: A section on painting, featuring artwork like "Rose and Jack" (with a linked weather station image, possibly tying into a Titanic reference or something whimsical).

Overall, it's a low-key professional landing page from around the mid-2010s (based on the design and links), blending academia with creative elements.
