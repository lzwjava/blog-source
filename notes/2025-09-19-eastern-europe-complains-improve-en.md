title: Eastern Europe's Complain Culture Fuels Improvement
translated: false
---

The "DNA" in question refers to a cultural trait common in Eastern Europe: an open and frequent tendency to complain about problems, express dissatisfaction, and criticize how things are going. This isn't seen as negativity for its own sake but as a social norm that builds bonds, highlights issues early, and drives continuous improvement—turning what might seem like pessimism into a strength for high performance. It's akin to a "complain culture" or "culture of grievance" observed in the region, where voicing complaints is ritualized and helps people connect while addressing real concerns. In OpenAI's context, this imported element encourages candid feedback loops that contribute to the company's effectiveness.
