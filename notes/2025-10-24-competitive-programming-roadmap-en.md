title: Competitive Programming Advanced Achievement Roadmap
translated: false
---

This roadmap is designed for motivated learners with basic programming knowledge (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions) aiming to reach Codeforces Expert rating (2000+) or secure a gold medal at ACM ICPC regionals (typically top 10-20% of teams). Codeforces 2000+ means consistently solving Div. 2 C/D/E or Div. 1 A/B problems under time pressure. For ICPC, focus on team synergy, but individual mastery is key—regionals involve 3-hour contests with 8-12 problems per team.

**Key Assumptions and Setup:**
- **Language:** C++ (preferred for speed and STL). Master fast I/O, templates, and debugging. Alternatives: Java (slower) or Python (for prototyping, not contests).
- **Time Commitment:** 15-30 hours/week. Expect 6-24 months depending on prior experience and consistency.
- **Mindset:** Solve problems actively (15-60 min thinking before editorial). Implement every solution. Upsolve 1-2 problems per contest. Track progress via rating or solved count.
- **Tools:** Use Codeforces (CF), AtCoder, CodeChef, USACO Guide, CP-Algorithms.com. Join a team early for ICPC (same university, complementary skills).

The roadmap is phased by approximate CF rating milestones, blending individual growth with ICPC prep (e.g., team mocks). Topics draw from standard curricula; practice on increasing difficulty (solve ~30-50% independently in your range).

## Phase 1: Foundations (0-1200 CF / Beginner, 1-3 Months)
Build core skills. Goal: Solve CF Div. 2 A/B confidently; understand problem statements fully.

**Core Topics:**
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, strings, stacks, queues, linked lists, sets/maps (STL).
- **Algorithms:** Sorting (merge/quick), binary/ternary search, basic math (GCD/LCM, primes via sieve, modular arithmetic).
- **Techniques:** Brute force, simulation, ad-hoc problems.
- **Math Basics:** Arithmetic (bit manipulation, high-precision), simple combinatorics (perms/combs).

**Practice Plan:**
- Solve 200-300 easy problems (CF 800-1100 rating).
- Platforms: AtCoder ABC A/B, CodeChef Starter A/B, USACO Bronze.
- Contests: 1-2/week (live + virtual). Upsolve all unsolved.
- Weekly: 1 mock ICPC session (3 problems, 2 hours solo).
- Milestone: Solve a full Div. 2 A/B in <1 hour.

**Tips:** Focus on clean code and edge cases. Read "Competitive Programmer's Handbook" for basics.

## Phase 2: Intermediate (1200-1600 CF / Pupil/Specialist, 2-4 Months)
Introduce optimization. Goal: CF Div. 2 B/C; handle graphs/DP intuitively.

**Core Topics:**
- **Data Structures:** Priority queues, hash maps, disjoint set union (DSU), basic trees.
- **Algorithms:** Graphs (BFS/DFS, Dijkstra, MST via Kruskal/Prim), greedy, basic DP (knapsack, coin change, LIS).
- **Strings:** Prefix functions, basic hashing.
- **Math:** Number theory (Euclid, factorization), probability basics.

**Practice Plan:**
- Solve 300-400 problems (CF 1100-1500).
- Platforms: CF problemset (filter by rating), TopCoder SRM Div. 2 Medium, CodeChef Div. 2 A/B/C.
- Contests: Every CF/AtCoder round; virtualize 1 old ICPC regional/week.
- Weekly: Team practice (if ICPC-bound)—divide problems, discuss solutions.
- Milestone: +200 rating gain; solve 3/5 Div. 2 problems in contest.

**Tips:** Implement DS from scratch (e.g., DSU). Use 2-pointer/sweep line for reuse. For ICPC, practice partial scoring (subtasks).

## Phase 3: Advanced (1600-1900 CF / Expert Candidate, 3-6 Months)
Deepen analysis. Goal: CF Div. 2 C/D/E, Div. 1 A; ICPC regional qualification.

**Core Topics:**
- **Data Structures:** Segment/Fenwick trees, tries, sqrt decomposition.
- **Algorithms:** Advanced graphs (flows/min-cut, LCA, topological sort), DP optimization (convex hull trick, bitmask DP), strings (KMP/Z-algorithm, suffix arrays).
- **Geometry:** Convex hull, line intersection, closest pair.
- **Math:** Combinatorics (matrix expo), bitmasks, randomized algos (hashing).

**Practice Plan:**
- Solve 400-500 problems (CF 1500-1900).
- Platforms: USACO Silver/Gold, AtCoder ABC C/D, SPOJ classics, ICPC Archive (uHunt book).
- Contests: All live; 2-3 virtuals/week. For ICPC, mock regionals (full 3-hour, 10 problems/team).
- Weekly: Review weak areas (e.g., geometry via CF tags); analyze contest mistakes.
- Milestone: Consistent 1600+ contest performance; solve 4/6 Div. 2 problems.

**Tips:** Think in graphs/DP frames (e.g., "dependencies?"). Editorial after 30-45 min stuck. For teams: Rotate roles (coder, debugger, thinker).

## Phase 4: Mastery (1900-2000+ CF / Expert, 3-6 Months+)
Refine for consistency. Goal: CF 2000+ (top 10% Div. 2); ICPC regional gold (top teams solve 6-8/10 problems).

**Core Topics:**
- **Advanced Data Structures:** Heavy-light decomposition (HLD), palindromic trees, Mo's algorithm.
- **Algorithms:** Network flows (advanced), game theory (Nim/Grundy), FFT, Diophantine equations.
- **Techniques:** Meet-in-middle, A* search, branch-and-bound, probabilistic methods.
- **Math:** Advanced number theory, geometry (polygons, 3D).

**Practice Plan:**
- Solve 300+ hard problems (CF 1900+, TopCoder Div. 1 Easy/Medium).
- Platforms: CF Div. 1, AtCoder ARC, old ICPC World Finals, Kattis.
- Contests: Every opportunity; 3+ virtuals/week. Simulate ICPC with time pressure (no pauses).
- Weekly: High-difficulty grinds; team debriefs on optimizations.
- Milestone: Stable 2000+ rating; gold in practice regionals.

**Tips:** Speed up implementation (pre-write templates). Balance topics via natural exposure (not rote lists). For ICPC: Scout regionals, form balanced team (fast coder + math whiz + debugger).

## General Strategies Across Phases
- **Daily Routine:** 1-2 hours solving + 30 min review. Use timers for thinking/implementation.
- **Problem-Solving Framework:** Observe constraints, simplify (e.g., binary/graph view), reuse info (DP/greedy), test extremes. Avoid overcomplication—guess simple first.
- **Tracking Progress:** CF rating graph; log solved ratings. If plateaued, grind 20% harder problems.
- **ICPC-Specific:** Register via icpc.global (team of 3, coach). Prelims on Codedrills; regionals onsite. Practice team comms (e.g., "I have partial on #3").
- **Common Pitfalls:** Skipping upsolves, ignoring math/geometry, poor debugging (use prints, not just IDE).
- **Books/Resources:** 
  - "Competitive Programming" by Halim (algorithms bible).
  - USACO Guide (free, topic-based).
  - CP-Algorithms (quick refs).
  - Errichto videos (YouTube) for intuition.

Stay consistent—ratings spike with volume. Join CF blogs/Reddit for motivation. Good luck!
