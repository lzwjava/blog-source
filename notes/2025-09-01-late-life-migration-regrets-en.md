You're asking about older individuals who wanted to move to the U.S. but didn't—and now, in their later years, feel regret. They may cite varied reasons for their regrets and explain why migration wasn’t possible when they were younger.

Here’s what research and real experiences point to:

## Common Regret Reasons — Why They Didn’t Move When Young

1. **Family Responsibilities**
   Many older adults postponed—or never attempted—immigration due to caring for family, such as elderly parents or young children, making it socially or financially difficult to leave.

2. **Economic Constraints & Lack of Resources**
   They often lacked the necessary financial means, job opportunities, or education to support immigration as younger adults. As older immigrants themselves now show, many elderly newcomers face economic hardship, poverty, limited benefits access, and often continue working in later life to make ends meet ([Justice in Aging][1]).

3. **Limited Immigration Pathways When Younger**
   The immigration system often favors family reunification—especially sponsorship by adult children. Therefore, many arrive later in life, once their children in the U.S. are able to sponsor them ([CIS.org][2]).

4. **Circumstantial or Policy Barriers**
   Restrictions like visa caps, long processing times, or shifting policies made young adulthood immigration particularly difficult. Some might have lacked awareness or guidance about available options back then.

## Regret Reasons Expressed in Later Life

1. **Lost Opportunities & Life Experiences**
   Later in life, many regret not exploring opportunities earlier—be it career, education, cultural exchange, or quality of life improvements.

2. **Health & Acculturation Challenges After Late Move**
   Those who eventually migrate at age 75 or older may find their health declines more post-migration. Acculturation stresses and adapting to a new system in old age can be particularly taxing ([PMC][3], [Reddit][4]).

3. **Economic Vulnerabilities**
   Older immigrants often face higher poverty rates, limited access to public benefits (due to eligibility rules like the five‑year bar), and high healthcare and living costs ([Justice in Aging][1]).

4. **Social Isolation & Loneliness**
   Older immigrants are significantly more prone to loneliness than their non-immigrant peers, especially when arriving later and struggling with language or community connections ([Maxwell School][5]).

## Real-World Voices (From Expats & Online Discussions)

Some comments capture emotional regret or frustration:

> “It’s a beautiful country but I need my walkable city… I miss enjoying simple things in life… It’s easy to have a community in Europe… I don’t want to use a car all the time.”
> — Reflecting how lifestyle mismatches can fuel regret ([Reddit][4])

> “Moving to a new country can go really wrong… Sometimes it’s not the right place, sometimes it’s not the right time.”
> — Expresses wistfulness about timing and fit ([Reddit][4])

These sentiments illustrate that it's common to reflect in old age and feel that, had timing or circumstances been different, a move to the U.S. earlier in life might have yielded a better fit or more fulfilling experience.

### Summary (Concise)

* **Barriers in youth**: Family obligations, economic hardship, lack of sponsorship or migration pathways.
* **Later regrets**: Missed personal or economic opportunities; elevated challenges in health, finances, access to services, and social belonging when migrating late.
* **Emotional regrets**: Longing for different lifestyle, freedom, integration—unfulfilled dreams that linger more with age.
