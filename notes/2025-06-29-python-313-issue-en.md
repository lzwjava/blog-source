### Problem Description

You're encountering an `AttributeError` when running a Python script that imports the CuPy library for GPU computations. The error occurs during the `import cupy as cp` statement, preventing the script from executing. The traceback points to an issue within CuPy's internal code, specifically in `cupy/cuda/device.pyx` at line 105, where a `memoize` decorator attempts to modify the `__name__` attribute of a built-in function or method. The error message is:

```
AttributeError: attribute '__name__' of 'builtin_function_or_method' objects is not writable
```

This issue appears to be related to your use of Python 3.13, which may introduce compatibility problems with the version of CuPy you have installed.

### Cause of the Error

The error arises because:

- **CuPy's `memoize` Decorator**: CuPy uses a `memoize` decorator to cache function results for performance optimization. This decorator relies on Python's `functools.update_wrapper` to copy attributes (like `__name__`) from the original function to the wrapper function.
- **Built-in Functions**: In Python, built-in functions (implemented in C) have a read-only `__name__` attribute. When `update_wrapper` tries to set this attribute, it fails with an `AttributeError`.
- **Python 3.13 Compatibility**: The specific function being memoized in CuPy's `device.pyx` is likely a built-in function, and Python 3.13 may enforce stricter rules or handle built-ins differently than previous versions, exposing this issue.

Since the error occurs during the import of CuPy, it’s a systemic issue tied to the library’s initialization rather than your script’s logic.

### Recommended Solution

The simplest and most practical fix is to run your script with an earlier version of Python where CuPy is known to be compatible, such as Python 3.11 or 3.12. This avoids the compatibility issue with Python 3.13 without requiring modifications to CuPy’s source code or complex workarounds.

#### Why This Works

- **Compatibility**: CuPy versions up to the latest releases (e.g., v11) are tested and supported on Python versions like 3.11 and 3.12, where this specific error does not occur.
- **No Code Changes**: Your script, which benchmarks GPU sorting with CuPy, can run as-is in an earlier Python environment, ensuring the benchmark’s integrity.
- **Ease of Implementation**: Switching Python versions is straightforward using virtual environments or tools like `conda`.

### Step-by-Step Fix

Here’s how to resolve the issue:

#### Option 1: Using `virtualenv`

1. **Install Python 3.11 or 3.12**
   - Ensure Python 3.11 or 3.12 is installed on your system (e.g., via your package manager or official Python website).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   virtualenv -p python3.11 venv
   ```
   This creates a virtual environment named `venv` using Python 3.11. Replace `python3.11` with `python3.12` if preferred.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install CuPy**
   ```bash
   pip install cupy
   ```
   This installs the latest compatible version of CuPy for Python 3.11.

5. **Run Your Script**
   ```bash
   python scripts/benchmark/cudamark.py
   ```
   Your script should now execute without the `AttributeError`.

6. **Deactivate (When Done)**
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

#### Option 2: Using `conda`

1. **Create a Conda Environment**
   ```bash
   conda create -n cudabench python=3.11
   ```
   This creates an environment named `cudabench` with Python 3.11. Use `python=3.12` if you prefer Python 3.12.

2. **Activate the Environment**
   ```bash
   conda activate cudabench
   ```

3. **Install CuPy**
   ```bash
   pip install cupy
   ```

4. **Run Your Script**
   ```bash
   python scripts/benchmark/cudamark.py
   ```

5. **Deactivate (When Done)**
   ```bash
   conda deactivate
   ```

### Verifying the Fix

After setting up the environment and running the script, you should see output similar to:

```
CPU cores: <your_cpu_cores>
Threads: 1, Time taken: X.XXXX seconds
Threads: 2, Time taken: X.XXXX seconds
...
ThreadCount,TimeTakenSeconds
1,X.XXXXXX
2,X.XXXXXX
...
```

If the script runs without the `AttributeError`, the fix is successful.

### Additional Notes

- **Thread Counts in Your Script**: Your script iterates over thread counts (`1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128`), but the `parallel_sort_gpu` function uses CuPy’s GPU-based sorting (`cp.sort`), which doesn’t directly utilize CPU threads. The thread count loop may not affect GPU sorting performance as expected. If this is intentional for future modifications (e.g., adding CPU threading), it’s fine; otherwise, you might simplify the benchmark to focus solely on GPU performance.
- **CuPy Version**: If you suspect an outdated CuPy version, ensure you’re installing the latest by running `pip install cupy --upgrade`. However, the primary issue here is Python 3.13 compatibility, not the CuPy version alone.
- **Long-Term Solution**: If you must use Python 3.13, consider checking CuPy’s GitHub repository or issue tracker for updates supporting Python 3.13 (as of June 2025, this might be available). Alternatively, you could fork CuPy and patch the `memoize` decorator to handle built-in functions, but this is more complex and unnecessary for a benchmark.

By using Python 3.11 or 3.12, you can reliably run your GPU benchmark without encountering this error.
