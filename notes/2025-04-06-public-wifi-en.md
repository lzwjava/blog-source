title: Dangers about Using Public Wi-FI
translated: false
---

Using **public Wi-Fi or hotel Wi-Fi** can be risky because these networks are often **insecure or poorly configured**, making them easy targets for attackers. Here are the main dangers:

---

### 🔓 1. **No Encryption (or Weak Encryption)**
- Many public networks use **no encryption** or **WEP**, which can be cracked easily.
- This means attackers can **see your traffic** in plaintext—like login credentials or emails.

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ 2. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**
- An attacker on the same network can **intercept your data** or even alter it in transit.
- They can pose as the Wi-Fi access point (e.g., set up a fake "FreeHotelWiFi").

---

### 📥 3. **Malware Distribution**
- Some compromised hotspots may **inject malicious code** into HTTP websites.
- Malware can be automatically downloaded to your device.

---

### 🧑‍💻 4. **Session Hijacking**
- Attackers can **steal cookies** from sites you visit, letting them impersonate you (e.g., Facebook, Gmail).
- This works especially on websites without full HTTPS protection.

---

### 🌐 5. **Evil Twin Attacks**
- A rogue hotspot with the same name as the legitimate network can trick you into connecting.
- Once connected, attackers can log or manipulate everything you send or receive.

---

### 🔐 6. **Credential Theft**
- Logging into apps or websites over public Wi-Fi can expose your **usernames and passwords**—especially if the site isn’t using HTTPS correctly.

---

### ⚠️ 7. **Data Snooping by Network Providers**
- Hotels or cafés may **log your traffic** for tracking, monetization, or surveillance.

---

### 🔒 How to Stay Safe on Public Wi-Fi

1. ✅ **Use a VPN** – encrypts all your traffic.
2. 🔐 **Use HTTPS** – look for the padlock in the browser.
3. 📵 **Avoid sensitive tasks** – like online banking or private work.
4. 🛑 **Turn off sharing** – file/printer sharing, AirDrop, etc.
5. 🚫 **Forget the network after use** – to avoid auto-reconnect.
6. 📲 **Use mobile data/hotspot instead** – more secure for sensitive stuff.
