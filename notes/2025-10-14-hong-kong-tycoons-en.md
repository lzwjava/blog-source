### Top 10 Wealthiest Individuals/Families in Hong Kong with HK-Rooted Businesses (2025)

Based on the latest Forbes and other data as of October 2025, here's a filtered list focusing on the top individuals/families whose primary companies are headquartered in Hong Kong, originated there, and primarily serve the local Hong Kong market (e.g., through real estate, retail, utilities, and consumer goods). I've excluded those with mainland China-based operations as their core (like CATL or Alibaba). Net worths are in USD billions. Headcount figures are for employees based in Hong Kong where specified; otherwise, noted as total (primarily HK-focused).
