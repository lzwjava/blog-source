### Graduation Eligibility Warning

This message appears to be an automated alert from a university academic system (likely in China, based on the course names and references to the Ministry of Education). It's notifying you that your current academic record **does not meet the requirements for graduation**. Specifically, it flags potential issues with one or more of the following:

1. **04729. College Chinese** – A required general education course on language and literature.
2. **02198. Linear Algebra** – A foundational math course for engineering or computer science majors.
3. **04730. Fundamentals of Electronic Technology (III)** – An advanced electronics course, part 3 of a series.
4. **04732. Microcomputer and Interface Technology** – Covers computer hardware, microprocessors, and interfacing.
5. **02141. Computer Network Technology** – Focuses on networking principles, protocols, and technologies.
6. **11325. Computer and Application Course Experiment (I)** – A hands-on lab course for computer applications, part 1.
7. **Fewer than 2 ideological and political (思政) courses** – These are mandatory courses on politics, ideology, and ethics (common in Chinese higher education); you need at least 2 credits or subjects.

#### Key Points:
- **Issue**: One (or more) of these items hasn't been passed, or the ideological/political course count is insufficient. This blocks graduation.
- **Advice**: If the system has incorrectly predicted course substitutions (e.g., equivalent credits from transfers or electives), click the **"Re-select Substitution Relationship Prediction"** button at the bottom of the page. This lets you manually adjust and re-run the check.
- **Disclaimer**: The final decision is up to the **Ministry of Education's official review** – this is just a preliminary prediction.

If this is from your student portal, double-check your transcript for grades, credits, or any pending exams. Contact your academic advisor for help resolving these!
