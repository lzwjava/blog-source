The error message `feature edition2024 is required` indicates that your project is configured to use the `edition2024` of Rust, but your current Cargo version (1.84.1) does not yet support it in a stable release. Edition 2024 is still considered an unstable/nightly feature.

Here's how to fix it and information on Cargo's latest version:

### How to Fix

You have two main options:

**1. Use a Nightly Rust Toolchain (Recommended for `edition2024`)**

Since `edition2024` is an unstable feature, you need to use a nightly build of Rust and Cargo to compile your project.

  * **Install the Nightly Toolchain:** If you don't have it already, use `rustup` to install the nightly toolchain:
    ```bash
    rustup toolchain install nightly
    ```
  * **Use the Nightly Toolchain for your build:** You can tell Cargo to use the nightly toolchain specifically for this command:
    ```bash
    OPENSSL_STATIC=yes cargo +nightly build --release
    ```
  * **(Optional) Set Nightly as Default for the Project:** If you want this project to always use nightly, you can create a `rust-toolchain.toml` file in your project's root directory with the following content:
    ```toml
    [toolchain]
    channel = "nightly"
    ```
    Then, you can just run `OPENSSL_STATIC=yes cargo build --release` as usual, and `rustup` will automatically select the nightly toolchain for this project.

**2. Downgrade your Project's Edition (If `edition2024` features aren't critical)**

If your project doesn't strictly rely on `edition2024` features, you could change the edition back to `2021` (the current stable edition) in your `Cargo.toml`.

  * **Edit `Cargo.toml`:** Open your project's `Cargo.toml` file (specifically `/Users/lzwjava/projects/seeker/seeker/Cargo.toml` as indicated in the error) and change the `edition` field:
    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "your-package-name"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2021" # Change this from "2024" to "2021"
    ```
  * **Run `cargo fix --edition` (Optional but recommended):** After changing the edition, you might need to run `cargo fix --edition` to automatically update some code to be compatible with the older edition.

### What's Cargo's Latest Version?

As of July 2025, the latest **stable** version of Cargo (and Rust) is **1.88.0**.

The `edition2024` feature is still in the nightly channel, meaning it's under active development and not yet part of a stable release. It is expected to be stabilized in a future release, likely Rust 1.89.0 (currently in beta).
