It looks like you're providing context on the storage conditions—specifically, temperatures in Guangzhou during September, ranging from about 25°C to 35°C (77°F to 95°F). This is warm by potato storage standards, and it might be affecting your sweet potatoes' sprouting. Let me address how this ties into the edibility question from before.

### Impact on Potato Storage and Sprouting
- **Ideal vs. Your Conditions:** Potatoes store best in cool, dark, dry places at 7-13°C (45-55°F) to slow sprouting and prevent rot. Guangzhou's September climate is consistently warm and humid, which accelerates sprouting and spoilage. At 25-35°C, sprouting can start within days or a week, much faster than in cooler environments—your 20+ days might be enough for heavy sprouting due to the heat.
  
- **Are Sprouted Potatoes Still Edible Here?**  
  Similar rules apply as before: Lightly sprouted ones (small shoots, firm flesh) are generally safe if you trim the sprouts, peel off green areas, and cook well to neutralize solanine. But in tropical-like warmth, the risk of mold, rot, or higher solanine buildup increases. Discard if they're soft, wrinkly, mushy, heavily green, or smelly—don't risk food poisoning.  
  - **Evidence:** Food safety research (e.g., from organizations like the UN FAO or USDA) shows potatoes in warm climates spoil 2-3x faster due to enzymatic activity and humidity. In places like Guangzhou, aim to store in a cool spot (e.g., shaded room or fridge if possible) and consume sooner.  

### Tips for Handling in Warm Climates
- **Short-Term Storage:** Keep them in a breathable bag in a dark, ventilated area away from direct sun or heat sources. A root cellar or even an insulated box with damp sand can help mimic cooler temps.
- **Alternatives:** If sprouting is common, opt for vacuum-sealed or refrigerated storage to extend freshness. Purple sweet potatoes hold up slightly better due to starch content, but heat affects both.
- **When to Eat:** Check daily; if they're sprouting rapidly, priority cook or use them soon (e.g., in dishes like stir-fries or baked goods). For long-term: Consider buying fresh batches more often.

If this isn't what you meant or you have more details (e.g., photos of the potatoes), feel free to clarify for better advice! Safety first—better to err on discarding if in doubt.
