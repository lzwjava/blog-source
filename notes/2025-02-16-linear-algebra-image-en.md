title: Linear Algebra - Image Processing
---

Linear algebra is a fundamental tool in image processing and computer vision. Here are some ways linear algebra is applied to images:

1. **Image Representation**:
   - An image can be represented as a matrix where each element corresponds to a pixel's intensity or color value. For grayscale images, this is a 2D matrix, while color images (like RGB) are often represented as 3D matrices (or tensors).

2. **Image Transformations**:
   - **Rotation, Scaling, and Translation**: These operations can be performed using transformation matrices. For example, rotating an image involves multiplying the original image matrix by a rotation matrix.
   - **Affine Transformations**: These include combinations of rotation, scaling, translation, and shearing, and are represented using affine transformation matrices.

3. **Image Filtering**:
   - Convolution operations, which are used for filtering images (e.g., blurring, sharpening, edge detection), can be represented as matrix multiplications. The filter (or kernel) is a small matrix that is applied to each part of the image.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) use linear algebra to reduce the dimensionality of image data, which can be useful for compression or feature extraction.

5. **Image Compression**:
   - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be used to compress images by approximating the original image matrix with fewer components.

6. **Eigenfaces for Face Recognition**:
   - In face recognition, eigenfaces are created using eigenvectors of a set of face images. This involves computing the covariance matrix of the image data and finding its eigenvectors.

7. **Image Reconstruction**:
   - Techniques like compressed sensing use linear algebra to reconstruct images from a limited set of measurements.

8. **Camera Calibration**:
   - In computer vision, linear algebra is used to calibrate cameras by estimating intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, which are represented as matrices.
