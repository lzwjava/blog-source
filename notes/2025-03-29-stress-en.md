It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed or stressed, especially when juggling multiple responsibilities. Here are some strategies that might help you manage stress and find a better balance:

1. **Self-Care**:
   - **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Practicing mindfulness can help you stay present and reduce stress. Even a few minutes of meditation each day can make a difference.
   - **Exercise**: Physical activity can boost your mood and reduce feelings of anxiety or depression. Find an activity you enjoy, whether it's walking, yoga, or a sport.
   - **Sleep**: Ensure you're getting enough rest. Adequate sleep is crucial for both physical and mental health.

2. **Time Management**:
   - **Prioritize Tasks**: Use a to-do list or a planner to organize your tasks. Prioritize them based on urgency and importance.
   - **Breaks**: Take regular breaks to prevent burnout. Techniques like the Pomodoro Technique can help structure your work and break times.
   - **Avoid Multitasking**: Focus on one task at a time to improve productivity and reduce stress.

3. **Support System**:
   - **Talk to Someone**: Share your feelings with friends, family, or a mental health professional. Sometimes, talking about your stress can provide relief and new perspectives.
   - **Seek Professional Help**: If feelings of stress or sadness persist, consider speaking with a therapist or counselor.

4. **Set Realistic Goals**:
   - **Break Down Large Tasks**: Divide big projects into smaller, manageable parts to make them less daunting.
   - **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem.

5. **Mindset Shift**:
   - **Practice Gratitude**: Regularly reflect on the things you're grateful for. This can help shift your focus from what's going wrong to what's going right.
   - **Reframe Stress**: Try to view stress as a challenge rather than a threat. This mindset can help you approach stressful situations more positively.

6. **Healthy Lifestyle**:
   - **Nutrition**: Eat a balanced diet to support your overall health and energy levels.
   - **Hydration**: Stay hydrated throughout the day.

7. **Hobbies and Relaxation**:
   - **Engage in Hobbies**: Make time for activities you enjoy. This can provide a much-needed break from work and other responsibilities.
   - **Relaxation Techniques**: Explore techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or yoga to help manage stress.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help and to take time for yourself. Finding a balance that works for you is key to managing stress and maintaining your well-being.

2. **Mental Overwhelm**: Having too many thoughts or tasks to handle at once, leading to difficulty in focusing or making decisions.

3. **Physical Overwhelm**: Feeling physically exhausted or experiencing symptoms like tension, headaches, or fatigue due to stress or overexertion.

4. **Sensory Overwhelm**: Being overstimulated by environmental factors such as noise, lights, or crowds, which can be particularly challenging for individuals with sensory sensitivities.
