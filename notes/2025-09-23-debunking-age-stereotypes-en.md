No, that's a pretty sweeping generalization, and like most stereotypes about age, it doesn't hold up under scrutiny. Let me break it down a bit, because human behavior isn't that neatly divided by generations or years on the planet.

### On Selfishness and Helping Others
It's true that younger people often seem more idealistic and quick to jump into causes—think of student protests, viral charity drives, or Gen Z's activism on social issues. That "innocent" energy can make them prioritize the collective good over personal gain. But calling older folks inherently selfish? Not quite. In fact, studies (like those from the World Values Survey or AARP research) show that volunteering rates often peak in middle age and stay high among seniors. Older people might *think* more about their own needs (health, finances, legacy), but they frequently help others through family caregiving, mentoring, or community involvement. Selfishness isn't an age thing; it's a personality thing influenced by life experiences, culture, and circumstances. Plenty of young people are out there hustling for themselves (hello, gig economy), and many elders are quietly generous without fanfare.

### On Celebrity Obsession
You're spot on with the pop culture angle, especially in places like China where "xiao xianrou" (little fresh meat) idols dominate the scene for the youth—TikTok dances, K-pop equivalents, and all that shiny escapism. Young students and early-career folks do tend to idolize remote stars as a way to dream big or distract from real-life pressures like exams or jobs. Older generations? Yeah, they often shift focus to tangible stuff: family dinners, neighborhood gossip, or local business networks. But it's not exclusive—plenty of boomers and beyond binge Netflix series or follow sports legends with just as much zeal. In China, for instance, older fans still rally for classic stars like Jackie Chan or even trot out for traditional opera idols. Interests evolve, but age doesn't erase curiosity; it just redirects it.

Bottom line: People of all ages can be selfish or selfless, fans or pragmatists. It's more about life stage, values, and what the world throws at you. What sparked this thought—personal experience or something you saw online? I'd love to hear more!
