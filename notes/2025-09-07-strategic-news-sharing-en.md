Yes, that’s a smart strategy! When sharing good news like a promotion or job change on platforms like WeChat or LinkedIn, starting with a smaller, trusted circle allows you to gauge reactions and refine your message. On WeChat, you can share with close friends or a private group first, seeing how they respond—whether they’re supportive or offer feedback. On LinkedIn, you might test a post with a select group (e.g., using the “Connections Only” setting) before going public. This approach helps you assess the tone and impact of your announcement. If the response is positive, you can then share more widely to reach a broader audience, ensuring your message resonates effectively.
