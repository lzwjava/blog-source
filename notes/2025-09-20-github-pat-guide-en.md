A GitHub **Personal Access Token (PAT)** is like a password you generate yourself for secure access to GitHub’s APIs and resources. It’s widely used because it’s more flexible and safer than typing your GitHub password everywhere.

Here’s how to use it **wisely** and what its **main functions** are:

## Main Functions of a PAT

1. **Authentication for Git Commands**
   Instead of entering your GitHub username and password when pushing/pulling, you use a PAT. This is especially important since GitHub disabled password authentication for Git over HTTPS.

2. **API Access**
   If you write scripts, tools, or CI/CD pipelines that call the GitHub API, a PAT lets you authenticate securely and make requests (like creating issues, fetching repos, or managing workflows).

3. **Access Control with Scopes**
   You decide exactly what the token can do (e.g., read-only access to repos, or write access for pushing code). This helps minimize damage if the token leaks.

4. **Automation & Integrations**
   Tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or local scripts can use PATs to fetch dependencies, publish packages, or update repos.

5. **Alternative to SSH**
   Some people prefer using PATs over setting up SSH keys—simpler to share across scripts or environments.

## How to Use a PAT Wisely

* **Limit Scopes**: Only give it the permissions you actually need. For example, if you just need to pull private repos, don’t give it write access.
* **Set Expiration**: Use short-lived tokens (e.g., 30 or 90 days) for most tasks. Renew them instead of keeping one forever.
* **Store Securely**: Don’t hardcode your PAT in scripts or push it to GitHub. Use environment variables, `.gitignore` files, or secrets managers (e.g., GitHub Actions Secrets, 1Password, AWS Secrets Manager).
* **Rotate Regularly**: Revoke old tokens you no longer use. This keeps your security hygiene clean.
* **Use Fine-Grained Tokens (Newer)**: GitHub now recommends fine-grained PATs where you can control repo-by-repo access instead of wide global access.
* **Prefer SSH for Daily Work**: PATs are best for automation and API use. For your own laptop coding, SSH keys are often safer and easier long-term.

👉 A good mental model:

* **PAT = password you can customize and revoke anytime.**
* **SSH key = badge for your own workstation.**
* Use **PATs for scripts, CI, or integrations**, and **SSH keys for your daily local development**.
