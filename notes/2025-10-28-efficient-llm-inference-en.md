### vLLM: Efficient LLM Inference and Serving

vLLM is an open-source library designed for fast, memory-efficient inference and serving of large language models (LLMs). Developed initially at UC Berkeley's Sky Computing Lab, it's now a community-driven project used widely in production for deploying LLMs like Llama or GPT variants. Its core innovation is **PagedAttention**, a technique that treats key-value (KV) cache memory like virtual memory pages, reducing waste and enabling higher throughput by dynamically allocating non-contiguous blocks.

#### How It Works
- **Continuous Batching**: Unlike traditional systems that wait for full batches, vLLM dynamically adds/removes requests mid-execution, minimizing idle GPU time during decoding.
- **Memory Management**: PagedAttention avoids fragmentation in the KV cache (which grows with sequence length), supporting longer contexts without OOM errors.
- **Optimized Execution**: Uses CUDA/HIP graphs for faster kernel launches, integrated with FlashAttention/FlashInfer for attention computation, and supports quantization (e.g., AWQ, GPTQ, FP8) to cut memory use by up to 4x.
- **Advanced Features**: Includes speculative decoding (to guess tokens and verify), chunked prefill (for long inputs), multi-LoRA (adapting models on-the-fly), and distributed parallelism (tensor, pipeline, expert).

vLLM exposes an OpenAI-compatible API server, integrates seamlessly with Hugging Face models, and runs on diverse hardware (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel GPUs, TPUs, CPUs). It's ideal for high-throughput scenarios, achieving 2-10x speedups over baselines like Hugging Face Transformers in serving benchmarks.

#### Key Use Cases
- Online serving for chatbots or APIs with streaming outputs.
- Offline batch inference for tasks like summarization.
- Scaling to multi-GPU clusters without custom plumbing.

### Ray: Unified Framework for Scaling AI and Python Apps

Ray is an open-source distributed computing framework that makes it easy to scale Python code—especially AI/ML workloads—from a single machine to massive clusters. Created by Anyscale (with UC Berkeley roots), it abstracts away distributed systems complexities like scheduling, fault tolerance, and orchestration, letting developers focus on logic.

#### Main Components
- **Ray Core**: The foundation—Pythonic primitives for tasks (parallel functions), actors (stateful services), and objects (distributed data sharing). It handles autoscaling, retries, and resource allocation automatically.
- **Ray AI Libraries**: Domain-specific tools built on Core:
  - **Ray Data**: Scalable ETL for preprocessing datasets.
  - **Ray Train**: Distributed training with integrations (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face).
  - **Ray Tune**: Hyperparameter optimization at scale.
  - **Ray Serve**: Model deployment for inference, with routing, batching, and A/B testing.
  - **RLlib**: Reinforcement learning toolkit.
- **Ray Clusters**: Managed infrastructure layer for deploying on clouds (AWS, GCP), Kubernetes, or on-prem, with autoscaling based on demand.

#### How It Works
Ray runs as a daemon on nodes, forming a cluster with a head node for coordination. You decorate functions with `@ray.remote` for parallelism, and it distributes execution across CPUs/GPUs. For ML, libraries like Serve handle HTTP endpoints and load balancing, while Core ensures fault-tolerant scaling (e.g., restarting failed tasks).

#### Key Use Cases in ML/AI
- End-to-end pipelines: Data loading → training → tuning → serving.
- Hyperparameter sweeps on 100s of GPUs.
- Real-time inference fleets, like in recommendation systems.
- Custom distributed apps, e.g., simulations or simulations.

Ray's strength is its unified API: Write once, scale anywhere, with low boilerplate compared to Spark or Dask.

### Relation Between vLLM and Ray
In systems like SLOs-Serve (from our earlier discussion), vLLM handles the low-level LLM batching/inference, while Ray orchestrates multi-replica deployments, routing requests across nodes for burst handling and scaling.
