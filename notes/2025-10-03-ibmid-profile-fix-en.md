title: Fix IBMid Profile Validation Errors
translated: false
---

It sounds like you're encountering a validation error when trying to update your IBMid profile to download the DB2 Community Edition (which is free from IBM). This is likely due to the form's strict input rules—commas (",") can sometimes trigger parsing issues in older web forms or databases, especially if they're not escaped properly. Here's how to troubleshoot and resolve this:

### Quick Fixes for the Form Fields
1. **Remove Commas Entirely**: 
   - Scan each field (e.g., Full Company Name, Street Address) and replace any commas with alternative separators like "and", " - ", or spaces. For example:
     - "ABC Company, Inc." → "ABC Company Inc."
     - "123 Main St., Apt 4" → "123 Main St Apt 4"
   - This should allow the form to submit without errors, as the system appears to block commas to prevent CSV-like conflicts or SQL injection risks in their backend.

2. **Other Common Restrictions to Check**:
   - Avoid special characters like semicolons (;), quotes (" or '), or backslashes (\) if possible.
   - Keep inputs concise—some fields might have length limits (e.g., 100 characters).
   - Use standard formats: 
     - Country: Select from dropdown if available (e.g., "United States" not "USA, Inc.").
     - State/Province: Use two-letter codes if prompted (e.g., "CA" for California).
     - Zip Code: No letters or hyphens if it's causing issues; try without the hyphen (e.g., "90210" instead of "90210-1234").

3. **Test the Update**:
   - Log in to your IBMid account at [id.ibm.com](https://id.ibm.com) (or the specific DB2 download page).
   - Go to Profile > Edit Company Details and try submitting the changes.
   - If it still fails, clear your browser cache/cookies or try an incognito window/private browsing mode.

### If It Still Doesn't Work
- **Contact IBM Support Directly**: This seems like a platform-specific bug. Reach out via:
  - IBMid Help: [www.ibm.com/account/help](https://www.ibm.com/account/help) or chat support on their site.
  - DB2 Community Forum: Post your issue on the IBM Developer community forums (search for "DB2 Community Edition download IBMid error").
  - Email: support@ibm.com or use the contact form on the DB2 download page ([www.ibm.com/products/db2-database](https://www.ibm.com/products/db2-database)).
- **Alternative Download Method**: If urgent, check if you can download DB2 Community Edition via Docker Hub or other mirrors (e.g., `docker pull ibmcom/db2`), but verify licensing on IBM's site to ensure compliance.

Once updated, you should be able to proceed with the download. If you share more details about the exact error message (without sensitive info), I can refine this advice! Note: I'm not affiliated with IBM, just helping based on common form issues.
