## TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic)

TTL was developed in the early 1960s by Texas Instruments, with the 7400 series introduced in 1964 becoming an industry standard. TTL represented a significant advancement from earlier technologies like DTL (Diode-Transistor Logic).

Key developments in TTL history:
- Originally created by James L. Buie at TRW in 1961
- Commercialized by Texas Instruments with their 5400/7400 series
- Standard TTL evolved into improved variants:
  - High-speed TTL (74H series)
  - Low-power TTL (74L series)
  - Schottky TTL (74S series) which reduced propagation delay
  - Low-power Schottky (74LS series)
  - Advanced Low-power Schottky (74ALS series)
  - Fast (74F series)

TTL dominated digital logic from the late 1960s through the 1970s and was used in early microcomputers, calculators, and various industrial equipment. Its widespread adoption was due to standardization, reliability, and relatively low cost.

## CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)

CMOS technology was invented in 1963 by Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor. The technology became commercially significant in the 1970s and eventually surpassed TTL.

Key developments in CMOS history:
- Patent filed by Frank Wanlass in 1963
- RCA developed the 4000 series CMOS logic family in the early 1970s
- Initially slower than TTL but offered significantly lower power consumption
- High-Density CMOS (HC/HCT) series introduced in the 1980s improved speed
- Advanced CMOS (AC/ACT) further improved performance in the late 1980s

CMOS eventually became the dominant technology for several reasons:
- Much lower power consumption, particularly when idle
- Better noise immunity
- Wider operating voltage range
- Greater integration density
- Manufacturing scalability that enabled Moore's Law to continue

By the 1990s, CMOS had become the foundation for virtually all digital ICs, from simple logic gates to complex microprocessors. Today's advanced processors, memory chips, and ASICs are almost exclusively CMOS-based, albeit with significant enhancements to the basic technology.

# How TTL and CMOS Integrated Circuits Work

## TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic)

TTL operates using bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and works through a specific arrangement of these transistors:

1. **Input Stage**: Uses a multi-emitter transistor where each emitter serves as an input.

2. **Operation Principle**: 
   - When all inputs are HIGH (~5V), the input transistor's base-collector junction is forward-biased, and its collector-emitter junction is reverse-biased, which turns OFF the output transistor.
   - When any input goes LOW (~0V), the input transistor saturates, turning ON the output transistor.

3. **Output Stage**: Typically employs a "totem pole" arrangement with two transistors. The upper transistor acts as a pull-up (sourcing current), and the lower transistor acts as a pull-down (sinking current).

4. **Characteristics**:
   - Operates with a 5V supply
   - Robust noise immunity (typically 0.8V for LOW, 2.0V for HIGH)
   - Capable of sinking more current than sourcing
   - Active pull-up and pull-down components

## CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)

CMOS works using complementary pairs of MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors):

1. **Basic Structure**: Each logic gate contains complementary pairs of P-channel (PMOS) and N-channel (NMOS) transistors.

2. **Operation Principle**:
   - When input is LOW (0V), the PMOS transistor turns ON while the NMOS transistor turns OFF.
   - When input is HIGH (supply voltage), the PMOS transistor turns OFF while the NMOS transistor turns ON.
   - This creates a complementary switching action where only one transistor is ON at a time.

3. **Power Characteristics**:
   - Near-zero static power consumption (power is only used during switching)
   - Current flows only momentarily during state changes when both transistors are partially conducting
   - Power consumption increases with switching frequency

4. **Key Features**:
   - Wide operating voltage range (typically 3-15V for older CMOS, 1.8-5V for modern variants)
   - High noise immunity (typically 30-40% of supply voltage)
   - Nearly equal sourcing and sinking capabilities
   - Very high input impedance

The fundamental difference between TTL and CMOS is that TTL uses current-controlled bipolar transistors, while CMOS uses voltage-controlled field-effect transistors, resulting in CMOS's significantly lower power consumption but traditionally slower switching speeds (though modern CMOS has overcome this limitation).
