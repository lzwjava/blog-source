### Yan Junjie's Research Ability

Yan Junjie, the founder and CEO of MiniMax (a leading Chinese AI company focused on multimodal models and applications), is widely regarded as one of the top researchers in computer vision and deep learning. With a PhD from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2014), he spent over a decade at SenseTime as a key scientist before founding MiniMax in 2021. His research has had significant impact, particularly in advancing real-time visual tracking and detection techniques that underpin modern AI systems like autonomous driving and video analysis.

His research ability is exceptional by academic standards:
- **Total citations**: Over 34,790 (as of late 2025).
- **h-index**: 80 (meaning he has 80 papers each cited at least 80 times).
- **i10-index**: 125 (125 papers with at least 10 citations each).
- **Publication count**: More than 100 peer-reviewed papers, many in top conferences like CVPR, ECCV, and ICCV.

These metrics place him among the elite in AI/computer vision— for comparison, an h-index above 50 is rare for mid-career researchers, and 80 reflects foundational contributions. His work emphasizes efficient, high-performance algorithms, blending theoretical innovation with practical deployment, which has directly influenced industry tools and open-source libraries.

### Main Academic Works

Junjie's research centers on visual object tracking, person re-identification, face recognition, and object detection using deep neural networks. His most influential papers often introduce novel architectures (e.g., Siamese networks) that balance accuracy and speed, earning thousands of citations each. Here are his top five most-cited works:

1. **High Performance Visual Tracking With Siamese Region Proposal Network** (2018, CVPR)  
   - Co-authors: B. Li et al.  
   - Citations: 3,522  
   - Key contribution: Introduced Siamese Region Proposal Networks (SiamRPN) for fast, accurate visual tracking, a breakthrough that became a standard in the field.

2. **SiamRPN++: Evolution of Siamese Visual Tracking with Very Deep Networks** (2019, CVPR)  
   - Co-authors: B. Li et al.  
   - Citations: 2,976

   - Citations: 1,818  
   - Key contribution: Enhanced Siamese trackers to handle distractors (similar objects) via response upsampling and channel attention.

4. **Spindle Net: Person Re-Identification with Human Body Region Guided Feature Decomposition and Fusion** (2017, CVPR)  
   - Co-authors: H. Zhao et al.  
   - Citations: 1,125  
   - Key contribution: A multi-branch CNN for person re-ID, decomposing features by body regions for better pose invariance.

5. **A Face Antispoofing Database with Diverse Attacks** (2012, ICB)  
   - Co-authors: Z. Zhang et al.  
   - Citations: 1,055  
   - Key contribution: Created a comprehensive dataset for face liveness detection, advancing anti-spoofing in biometrics.

These papers, primarily from his time at SenseTime and earlier, demonstrate his ability to solve real-world problems with elegant, scalable solutions. Post-MiniMax, his focus has shifted toward entrepreneurial applications, but his foundational research continues to cite heavily.
