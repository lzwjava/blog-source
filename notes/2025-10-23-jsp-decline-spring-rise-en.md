JavaServer Pages (JSP) was once a staple for building dynamic web applications in Java, allowing developers to embed Java code directly into HTML. However, over the years, its usage has significantly declined, especially in new projects. Spring Boot, a framework built on the Spring ecosystem, has become the go-to choice for Java web development. It's important to note that JSP and Spring Boot aren't direct competitors—JSP is a view technology (for rendering pages), while Spring Boot is a full framework for creating web apps, APIs, and microservices. The shift often means replacing traditional JSP/Servlet stacks with Spring Boot paired with modern templating engines or frontend frameworks.

This migration isn't about "stopping JSP entirely" (it's still used in legacy systems), but rather adopting more efficient, maintainable approaches. Below, I'll outline the key reasons based on developer discussions, surveys, and expert analyses.

## Key Reasons JSP Has Fallen Out of Favor
JSP, introduced in 1999, feels outdated in 2025's fast-paced development landscape. Here's why it's rarely chosen for new apps:

- **Messy and Hard-to-Maintain Code**: JSP encourages mixing Java scriptlets (e.g., `<% %>`) with HTML, leading to spaghetti code that's difficult to read, test, and debug. Generated servlet code from JSP can become a "hot mess," especially in large projects. This violates modern separation-of-concerns principles.

- **Poor Prototyping and Development Workflow**: JSP files can't be opened as static HTML in a browser—they require a running server (like Tomcat) to render properly due to custom tags. Making UI changes means deploying, restarting, and navigating the app, slowing iteration. Designers struggle with invalid HTML tags, hindering collaboration.

- **Error-Prone and Overly Flexible**: It allows excessive Java logic in templates, tempting developers into bad practices like business logic in views. This makes apps harder to scale and secure (e.g., XSS risks from unsanitized outputs).

- **Lack of Modern Features and Support**: Early versions had incomplete HTML5 support (e.g., no native `type="email"` binding until Spring 3.1). It needs third-party libraries for basics like Java Time API date formatting. Plus, it's not well-suited for interactive UIs, relying on full page reloads.

- **Low Adoption in Surveys**: Recent JVM surveys show only ~8% of apps use JSP-related tech like JSF, compared to 58% for Spring Boot. It's seen as a "relic" or "failed technology," with minimal mentions in architecture talks for over a decade.

## Why Spring Boot Has Taken Over
Spring Boot simplifies Java web development by building on Spring but reducing boilerplate. It doesn't replace JSP outright but makes it unnecessary through better abstractions and integrations. Developers flock to it for these reasons:

- **Rapid Setup and Auto-Configuration**: No manual XML configs or server setup—Spring Boot uses "starters" (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`) for dependencies, embeds Tomcat/Jetty, and provides sensible defaults. A "Hello World" app takes minutes, not hours.

- **Opinionated Yet Flexible**: It enforces best practices (e.g., MVC pattern) while allowing customization. Built-in support for REST APIs, security, testing, and monitoring makes it ideal for microservices and cloud-native apps.

- **Easier Maintenance and Scalability**: Abstracts low-level details like servlets (which Spring Boot still uses under the hood via DispatcherServlet) so you focus on business logic. Features like actuator endpoints and structured logging speed up production ops.

- **Vibrant Ecosystem**: Seamless integration with databases (JPA/Hibernate), caching (Redis), and modern views. It's production-ready out-of-the-box, with single JAR deployments—no more wrestling with WAR files.

- **Community and Job Market**: Spring Boot dominates job postings and tutorials. Learning it directly boosts employability without needing JSP fundamentals first (though basics help for debugging).

In short, Spring Boot hides the complexity that made raw JSP/Servlet apps tedious, letting teams build faster without sacrificing power.

## Modern Alternatives to JSP in Spring Boot
While JSP *can* work with Spring Boot (via `spring-boot-starter-web` and WAR packaging), it's actively discouraged—Spring Boot's "opinion" is that JSPs "stink" for the reasons above. Instead:

- **Thymeleaf (Most Popular)**: A natural templating engine that produces valid HTML. Advantages include static prototyping (open in browser without a server), HTML5-native support, readable syntax (e.g., `th:field` attributes), and easy internationalization. It's designer-friendly and integrates perfectly with Spring MVC. Example: A form in Thymeleaf looks like plain HTML, unlike JSP's tag-heavy mess.

- **Other Templating Engines**: Freemarker or Velocity for logic-light views; Mustache/Handlebars for simplicity.

- **Frontend-First Approaches**: Many Spring Boot apps serve JSON APIs consumed by React, Vue, or Angular SPAs. This decouples backend from views entirely, enabling richer UIs without server-side rendering.

For simple apps, even static HTML/CSS/JS with Spring Boot's resource handling suffices—no templating needed.

## Final Thoughts
The move from JSP to Spring Boot reflects a broader evolution toward cleaner, more productive tools. If you're maintaining legacy JSP code, migrate gradually (e.g., to Thymeleaf). For new projects, start with Spring Boot—it's the standard in 2025. Understanding JSP basics can still help demystify web fundamentals, but it's not a prerequisite.
