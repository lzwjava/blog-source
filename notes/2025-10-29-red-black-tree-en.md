### What is a Red-Black Tree?

A **red-black tree** is a type of self-balancing binary search tree (BST) used in computer science to store and retrieve data efficiently. It maintains balance by ensuring the tree remains roughly balanced after insertions and deletions, guaranteeing O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations, where n is the number of nodes.

#### Key Properties
Red-black trees enforce five rules to stay balanced:
1. **Node Colors**: Every node is either red or black.
2. **Root Node**: The root is always black.
3. **Leaf Nodes**: All NIL (null) leaves are black.
4. **Red Child Rule**: A red node cannot have red children (no two reds in a row).
5. **Black Height Rule**: Every path from a node to its descendant leaves has the same number of black nodes (ensures balance).

These rules prevent the tree from becoming skewed (like a linked list), which could degrade performance to O(n).

#### How It Works
- **Insertion**: Start like a standard BST insert. If the new node violates rules (e.g., red-red parent-child), perform "rotations" (left/right rotations to restructure) and "recoloring" to fix it. This keeps the height logarithmic.
- **Deletion**: Similar to insertion but more complex; involves finding a replacement node and adjusting colors/rotations to maintain properties.
- **Search**: Identical to a BST—traverse left/right based on key comparisons.

Rotations are local operations that preserve the BST property while fixing balance.

#### Visual Example
Here's a simple Markdown representation of a balanced red-black tree for keys 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 (R = red, B = black):

```
       B(30)
      /     \
   B(20)    B(40)
  /   \       \
R(10) R(25)  R(50)
```

#### Advantages
- **Compared to AVL Trees**: Red-black trees allow minor imbalances for fewer rotations during inserts/deletes, making them faster in practice for dynamic data (e.g., used in Java's TreeMap, Linux kernel).
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly taller than perfectly balanced trees but simpler to implement.

For deeper dives, check implementations in languages like Python (via sortedcontainers library) or C++ (std::set). If you need code examples or specifics, let me know!
