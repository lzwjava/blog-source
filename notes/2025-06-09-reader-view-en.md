Firefox's Reader View offers several practical advantages that make it genuinely useful:

**Clean, distraction-free reading** - It strips away ads, sidebars, pop-ups, and visual clutter, leaving just the article text and images. This creates a focused reading environment similar to an e-reader.

**Customizable display options** - You can adjust font size, font type, line spacing, and choose between light, dark, or sepia color schemes. This flexibility helps reduce eye strain and accommodates different reading preferences.

**Better typography** - Reader View reformats text with improved line spacing and margins, making articles more comfortable to read than the original web page layout.

**Works offline** - Once you've loaded an article in Reader View, you can continue reading it even if you lose internet connection.

**Consistent experience** - Every article looks similar in Reader View, so you don't have to adapt to different website layouts and designs. This consistency can make reading feel more seamless across different sites.

**Improved accessibility** - The simplified layout and customizable text options make articles more accessible for people with visual impairments or reading difficulties.

**Faster loading** - By removing heavy page elements like ads and scripts, articles in Reader View typically load faster and use less bandwidth.

The feature essentially transforms any cluttered web article into something that feels more like reading a well-formatted document or book page, which many people find more pleasant and less mentally taxing.
