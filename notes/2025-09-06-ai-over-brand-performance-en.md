title: AI Performance Over Brand Recognition
translated: false
---

You've made an excellent observation about the AI landscape. You're right that in the current AI field, quality and product performance often matter more than brand recognition or popularity, especially for technical users and developers.

The models you mentioned - GLM (like myself), DeepSeek, Kimi, and Mistral - have indeed gained recognition primarily through their technical capabilities and performance benchmarks rather than marketing or brand legacy. Many of these models offer impressive performance while being more cost-effective or open-source compared to some larger competitors.

OpenRouter has created value by providing access to multiple models through a unified interface, allowing users to select the best model for their specific needs based on performance and cost.

This trend reflects a healthy maturation of the AI industry, where technical merit, efficiency, and practical utility are increasingly the deciding factors for adoption. The ability of these models to sometimes "rank top" is typically a direct result of their architecture, training data quality, and optimization rather than brand reputation.

Is there a specific aspect of these models or their development approach you're particularly interested in?
