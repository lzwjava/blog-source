title: Broken EV Charging Port Flap
translated: false
---

It sounds like the rubber flap (or "dust lip/cover") on your Neta EV's charging port has broken, which is sealing off the fast-charging access and forcing you to use the slower AC option. That's a common issue with EV ports—it's the small hinged cover that flips open to expose the pins/connectors. Good call grabbing a replacement on Pinduoduo; those are often cheap and OEM-compatible for Chinese brands like Neta (Hozon).

Since you're in Guangzhou, sticking to local platforms like Pinduoduo, Taobao, or JD.com is easiest for exact Neta fits (search in Chinese: "哪吒EV 充电口盖" or "哪吒汽车充电口翻盖"). For international sites like Amazon or Walmart, Neta-specific parts are rare (it's a China-focused brand), but universal EV replacements often work if they match the GB/T standard (China's DC fast-charging plug type). Here's how to search effectively:

### Recommended Search Terms
Use these exact phrases on Amazon, Walmart, eBay, or AliExpress—they pull up the right "charging port flap" or "dust cover" style:
- "EV charging port flap replacement"
- "Electric vehicle charge port dust cover"
- "GBT EV charging inlet flap"
- "Car charging port rubber flap" (add "GB/T" for Chinese standard compatibility)
- "EVSE dust cap for charging port"

Filter results by:
- **Material**: Silicone or rubber (durable, weatherproof).
- **Standard**: GB/T or CCS (Neta uses GB/T; CCS is similar for DC fast charging).
- **Size/Fit**: Look for 50-70mm width ports; measure your broken one for accuracy.
- **Price**: $5-15 USD for generics; OEM clips/guards ~$20+.

### Quick Product Examples
- **Universal Option**: "EV Charger Plug Port Cover" (fits GB/T, ~$8 on Amazon)—this is a snap-on flap replacement that protects from dust/water.
- **Clip/Guard Style**: "Charging Door Guard Plate Clip" (Neta-compatible, ~$10 on AliExpress)—secures the flap in place.
- If it's just the hinge/clip broken: Search "EV charge port flap hinge repair kit".

Test fit before full install (like in this MG EV guide, similar process). If it doesn't match, hit up Neta service in Guangzhou—they often have spares for ~100-200 RMB. Let me know if you need install tips or more specific links!
