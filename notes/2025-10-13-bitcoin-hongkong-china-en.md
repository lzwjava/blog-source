### Your Experience in Hong Kong vs. Mainland China

Thanks for sharing that story—it's a perfect snapshot of how crypto like Bitcoin plays out differently just across the border. Meeting a shop owner casually chatting about Bitcoin ATMs and confirming a transaction works? That's classic Hong Kong: open, accessible, and integrated into everyday life. In contrast, spotting the same in mainland China feels rare because of the heavy regulations, as you noted with the low penetration, Great Firewall (GFW) blocking info, and outright bans on trading/mining. Let's break down how this shows up in real life today (as of October 2025), based on adoption trends, infrastructure, and on-the-ground vibes.

#### Hong Kong: Crypto as Part of the Daily Grind
HK has positioned itself as Asia's "Web3 hub," with supportive policies that make Bitcoin feel like just another payment option. Your encounter with the CoinUnit ATM isn't unusual—it's one of over 200 Bitcoin ATMs scattered across the city, from malls like K11 Art Mall to commercial centers in Tsim Sha Tsui and Shek Tong Tsui. These machines let people buy/sell BTC with cash or cards in minutes, often with low fees (around 5-8%) and multilingual support.

- **Real-life examples**: 
  - Walk into a spot like Yee Wo Street or Siu Hei Commercial Centre, and you'll see locals (young professionals, shop owners like your guy) using them for quick top-ups or remittances. Recent expansions by operators like COINHERO added more transparent-fee ATMs in high-traffic areas, making it even easier.
  - In daily scenes: Expats and traders hit ATMs near Central or Causeway Bay for BTC to hedge against HKD volatility. I've seen reports of street vendors accepting crypto via apps tied to these ATMs, and events like Web3 festivals draw crowds testing stablecoins.
  - Adoption stats: HK ranks 5th globally in Chainalysis' 2025 Crypto Adoption Index, with high DeFi and NFT activity. Over 10% of adults have touched crypto, fueled by licensed exchanges and no capital gains tax on it.

It's normalized—your shop owner knowing it and seeing transactions succeed? That's the ecosystem at work: reliable, visible, and low-drama.

#### Mainland China: Underground and Whispered
On the mainland, the 2021 ban on crypto trading, mining, and ICOs is still ironclad in 2025—no exchanges, no ATMs, and the GFW blocks most global sites like Binance or CoinMarketCap. The People's Bank of China enforces this to protect financial stability and push their digital yuan (e-CNY). Result? Super low official penetration (under 5% openly), but underground interest simmers—estimates put 78 million "owners" (mostly holding via offshore wallets, not active trading).

- **Real-life examples**:
  - Rare sightings: You might overhear young techies in Shenzhen or Shanghai cafes discussing BTC over VPNs (to bypass GFW), but it's hushed—fear of fines or account freezes keeps it private. No public ATMs; instead, peer-to-peer (P2P) trades via WeChat groups or apps like OKX (accessed offshore).
  - Everyday hurdles: A "successful charge" like yours? Tough without risking it. People use Hong Kong as a gateway—mainlanders cross the border for ATMs or exchanges, then ferry funds back via stablecoins. Recent court cases even sold seized tokens on HK platforms, hinting at subtle softening, but nothing overt.
  - Adoption quirks: Despite the ban, over-the-counter (OTC) desks in gray markets handle billions in volume annually. Young folks (your "young people" point) know it from global news leaks, but engagement is low—focus is on e-CNY for payments, not speculative BTC.

In short, China's setup makes crypto a shadow game: high curiosity, low visibility, and high risk. Your HK story highlights the "two Chinas" divide—same culture, worlds apart in policy.
