- **Recent Performance**: In the 2024 ICPC Polish Collegiate Programming Contest, a University of Warsaw team (Arkadiusz Czarkowski, Bartłomiej Czarkowski, and Tomasz Nowak) won a gold medal as the best team to solve 9 tasks, and they were also the 2024 ICPC Europe Champions. Other UW teams secured silver and bronze medals in the same contest.[](https://en.uw.edu.pl/icpc-polish-collegiate-programming-contest/)
- **Global Recognition**: A post on X highlighted that the University of Warsaw has outperformed even Harvard in terms of the number of students qualifying for the ICPC World Finals, with Polish teams consistently reaching the finals for 30 years.

The University of Warsaw’s success is attributed to the rigorous training of its students at the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics, under experienced coaches like Prof. Krzysztof Diks and Prof. Jan Madey, who received a Lifetime Coach Award in 2017. Their consistent qualification, frequent medal wins, and two world championships underscore their position as a global powerhouse in competitive programming.[](https://en.uw.edu.pl/acm-icpc-world-finals-in-rapid-city/)
