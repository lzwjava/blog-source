Cooking mushrooms in an air fryer is quick and easy, resulting in a crispy, flavorful dish. Here’s a simple guide to prepare mushrooms using an air fryer, optimized for delicious results:

### Basic Air Fryer Mushrooms Recipe

#### Ingredients
- 8–16 oz (225–450g) mushrooms (e.g., cremini, button, or shiitake), cleaned
- 1–2 tbsp olive oil (or avocado oil)
- 1 tsp garlic powder (optional)
- 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari (optional, for umami flavor)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: herbs (e.g., thyme, rosemary) or spices (e.g., paprika, cayenne)

#### Equipment
- Air fryer
- Mixing bowl
- Tongs or spatula

#### Instructions
1. **Prepare the Mushrooms**:
   - Clean mushrooms by gently wiping with a damp paper towel or brushing off dirt. Avoid soaking, as mushrooms absorb water.
   - Trim stems if needed. For larger mushrooms (like shiitake), slice into ¼-inch thick pieces. Keep smaller mushrooms (like button or cremini) whole or halved for bite-sized pieces.

2. **Season the Mushrooms**:
   - In a mixing bowl, toss mushrooms with olive oil, garlic powder, soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Ensure even coating.
   - Add optional herbs or spices for extra flavor (e.g., a pinch of smoked paprika for a smoky kick).

3. **Preheat the Air Fryer**:
   - Set your air fryer to 360–400°F (180–200°C). Preheating (3–5 minutes) ensures even cooking, but some models don’t require this.

4. **Cook the Mushrooms**:
   - Place mushrooms in the air fryer basket in a single layer. Avoid overcrowding to ensure crispiness.
   - Cook at 360°F (180°C) for 8–12 minutes, shaking the basket or tossing with tongs halfway through to promote even cooking.
   - Check for doneness: mushrooms should be golden, slightly crispy on the outside, and tender inside. If needed, cook an additional 2–3 minutes.

5. **Serve**:
   - Remove mushrooms and taste for seasoning, adding more salt or pepper if desired.
   - Serve immediately as a side dish, appetizer, or topping for salads, steaks, or grain bowls.

#### Tips for Best Results
- **Don’t Overcrowd**: Cook in batches if necessary to avoid steaming instead of crisping.
- **Vary Cooking Time**: Smaller mushrooms cook faster (6–8 minutes), while larger or denser varieties like shiitake may take longer.
- **Experiment with Flavors**: Try adding balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, or grated Parmesan after cooking for extra zest.
- **Cleaning the Air Fryer**: Line the basket with parchment paper (with holes for air circulation) to reduce cleanup if using sticky marinades.

#### Variations
- **Garlic Butter Mushrooms**: Toss with melted butter and minced garlic before air frying.
- **Spicy Mushrooms**: Add chili powder or sriracha to the seasoning mix.
- **Stuffed Mushrooms**: For larger mushrooms, stuff with cream cheese, garlic, and herbs before air frying at 350°F (175°C) for 10–12 minutes.

### Notes
- Cooking times and temperatures may vary based on your air fryer model. Check your manual for specific guidance.
- If using shiitake mushrooms, remove tough stems before cooking, as they can remain chewy.
- For crispier results, increase the temperature to 400°F (200°C) for the last 2 minutes, but monitor to avoid burning.
