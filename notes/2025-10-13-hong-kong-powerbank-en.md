### Power Bank Rental Options in Hong Kong

Hong Kong has a well-developed ecosystem for power bank rentals, especially useful for travelers or those out and about without their own chargers. These services let you borrow a power bank from a station (often in convenience stores, malls, or restaurants), use it via an app, and return it at any participating location. The two main players right now are **Keeta** (a newer entrant from Meituan) and **ChargeSPOT** (the market leader). There's also **MobiJuce**, an older local service that's still operational but less widespread. Here's a breakdown:

#### 1. **Keeta Power Bank**
   - **Overview**: Launched in Hong Kong in mid-2025 by Meituan (the parent company behind Keeta food delivery), this is a shared rental service with yellow charging cabinets in stores and public spots. It's app-based (download "Keeta充電寶" from the App Store or Google Play), and focuses on convenience with quick setup.
   - **How it works**: Scan a QR code at a station to rent, pay via the app (supports credit cards or mobile wallets), and return to any Keeta spot. Power banks typically have 10,000mAh capacity with multiple ports (USB-C, Lightning, Micro-USB).
   - **Pricing**: First 3 minutes free, then HK$6 per hour (billed in hourly increments). No daily cap mentioned, but expect a one-time HK$100 deposit (refundable upon return). It's currently cheaper than competitors.
   - **Availability**: Growing network, with stations in convenience stores, malls, and eateries. Check the app for nearby spots—it's expanding rapidly.
   - **Pros/Cons**: Affordable and integrated with Meituan's ecosystem (e.g., food delivery users get perks). Some users note slower charging speeds.

#### 2. **ChargeSPOT**
   - **Overview**: The biggest service in HK, with over 4,000 stations since 2018. Cabinets are common at 7-Eleven, Circle K, restaurants, hotels, and MTR-adjacent spots.
   - **How it works**: Use the ChargeSPOT app to scan QR, bind payment, and rent. Power banks are slim (around 10,000mAh) with universal cables. Return anywhere in their network (even internationally in some cities).
   - **Pricing**: HK$8 per hour (increased 30% in July 2025 from HK$6). First hour might have promos, but generally prepaid in HK$30 minimum chunks. Deposit around HK$100 (refundable). Daily caps apply in some cases (e.g., HK$60/day at certain venues).
   - **Availability**: Ubiquitous—every other convenience store or mall has one. App shows real-time stock.
   - **Pros/Cons**: Super convenient due to coverage, but pricier post-hike and some complaints about app glitches or slow support.

#### 3. **MobiJuce**
   - **Overview**: A homegrown HK startup from 2017, offering app-based rentals focused on malls and supermarkets.
   - **How it works**: Rent via app at kiosks, return to any location. Power banks support fast charging.
   - **Pricing**: Around HK$5-10 per hour (varies; check app for current rates—no recent hikes noted).
   - **Availability**: About 50+ spots, mainly AEON supermarkets, K11 mall, and Grand Plaza. Less dense than the others.
   - **Pros/Cons**: Local and reliable for specific areas, but smaller network means fewer options citywide.

#### Tips for Using These Services
- **Apps**: Download before you need them—Keeta and ChargeSPOT are essential. MobiJuce has its own app too.
- **Deposits & Payments**: Most require a HK$100 refundable deposit and accept Octopus, credit cards, or Alipay/WeChat Pay.
- **Regulations**: Power banks must be under 100Wh for flights (most rentals are ~37Wh, so fine). Recent HK aviation rules ban using them mid-flight.
- **Alternatives**: If you're a SmarTone customer, free rentals at their stores. Universities/hotels often have cheap on-site options (e.g., HK$5/hour at HK Metropolitan University).

If you're looking to **buy** a power bank instead (e.g., Anker or Belkin models at Fortress or YOHO stores), prices start at HK$150 for 10,000mAh units—let me know if you want details on that!
