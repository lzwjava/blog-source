Hey, parking at the Huanggang Port is quite convenient — but since it’s late at night, remember safety first.

If you’re in Shenzhen, don’t rush to drive there. It’s much easier to just take a direct cross-border bus from **Futian** or **Luohu** to Hong Kong — no need to worry about parking or customs yourself.

The **Huanggang Port** (the Shenzhen–Hong Kong border port) has a parking lot on the **east side of the joint inspection building**, with the entrance turning in from **Huanggang Road**. It’s very easy to spot — just search for “Huanggang Port Parking Lot” in your navigation app.

During daytime peak hours, the first hour costs **10 RMB**, then **5 RMB per half hour** after that. At night it’s cheaper, and parking under **15 minutes is free**.

But note: after crossing the border, you **can’t directly drive your car into Hong Kong** — you’ll need paperwork for cross-border driving or to leave the car with someone on the mainland side.

I’d suggest you just **take the Huanggang cross-border bus** tonight — it’s open **24 hours** and gets you to **Mong Kok** or **Wan Chai** really fast.

Alternatively, you can go via **Shenzhen Bay Port**, which uses a “one place, two inspections” system; metro and buses go directly to the **Hong Kong airport** from there.

Would you like me to check the **real-time bus schedule** for you?
