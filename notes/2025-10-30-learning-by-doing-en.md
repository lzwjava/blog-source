Ah, "learning by doing"—that's the heartbeat of John Dewey's philosophy, and it echoes exactly what you were saying about those unvisited stores, the hardware gaps in a software life, or the half-forgotten words in our native tongue. Dewey, the 20th-century American thinker (1859–1952), didn't just preach it; he lived it through his work in education, psychology, and pragmatism. He argued that real knowledge isn't poured into passive minds like facts into a filing cabinet—it's forged in the fire of action, reflection, and iteration.

At its core, Dewey's idea flips the script on traditional schooling: instead of rote memorization or abstract lectures, learning happens when you're knee-deep in experience. He saw education as a process of growth, where kids (and adults, really) grapple with real-world problems, experiment, make mistakes, and tweak their approaches. Think of it like building that hardware prototype you mentioned—sure, you could read a thousand tutorials, but until your fingers get greasy and your code crashes on real silicon, you haven't *learned* it. Dewey called this "experiential learning" or "instrumentalism," but the shorthand "learning by doing" stuck because it's punchy and true.

A quick breakdown:
- **The Why**: Dewey believed humans are active creatures, not sponges. Knowledge is a tool for navigating life, not an end in itself. In his 1938 book *Experience and Education*, he warned against "mis-educative experiences" (like drudgery without purpose) and championed ones that connect ideas to consequences.
- **The How**: Hands-on projects, collaborative problem-solving, and reflection loops. For example, in his Laboratory School at the University of Chicago (1896), kids didn't just study fractions—they baked bread, measured ingredients, and saw how math powers the oven. Apply it to adulthood: that Shenzhen-to-Hong-Kong hop? It's Deweyan—stepping out builds empathy, disrupts biases, and etches the lesson deeper than any VR tour.
- **The Impact**: It birthed progressive education, influenced Montessori and Reggio Emilia approaches, and even ripples into modern makerspaces, agile work, and lifelong learning apps. But Dewey wasn't naive; he stressed guidance from teachers to turn chaos into clarity, avoiding the pitfalls of "do whatever" anarchy.

Tying back to your musings: yeah, we all die with blind spots, but Dewey would say that's the point—life's a series of do-overs, not a checklist. The internet's a start (like Dewey's libraries of his day), but without the "doing," it's just echoes. So, what's one "doing" on your horizon that could crack open a new world?
