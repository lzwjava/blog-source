### **Outline of *Fundamentals of Electronic Technology (III)***  

#### **Part I: Analog Electronics**  
1. **Fundamentals of Circuit Analysis**  
   - Basic circuit concepts and laws (Ohm’s Law, Kirchhoff’s Laws)  
   - Linear circuit analysis methods (nodal analysis, superposition theorem)  
   - Dynamic circuits and transient analysis  

2. **Principles of Amplifier Circuits**  
   - Semiconductor devices (diodes, BJTs, and their characteristics)  
   - Basic amplifier configurations (CE, CC, CB)  
   - Frequency response and stability of amplifiers  

3. **Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps) and Applications**  
   - Op-amp characteristics and parameters (virtual short, virtual open)  
   - Typical op-amp circuits (inverting/non-inverting amplifiers, integrators/differentiators)  
   - Nonlinear applications (comparators, waveform generators)  

4. **DC Power Supplies**  
   - Rectifier and filter circuits  
   - Linear regulators vs. switching regulators

#### **Part II: Digital Electronics**  
5. **Fundamentals of Digital Circuits**  
   - Number systems and codes (binary, BCD, etc.)  
   - Boolean algebra and logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, combinational logic)  
   - TTL and CMOS integrated circuits  

6. **Combinational Logic Circuits**  
   - Analysis and design of combinational logic  
   - Common modules (encoders, decoders, multiplexers)  
   - Hazards and elimination methods  

7. **Sequential Logic Circuits**  
   - Flip-flops (RS, D, JK, T) and their operation  
   - Counters and shift registers  
   - Synchronous/asynchronous sequential circuit analysis  

8. **Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)**  
   - Types of PLDs (PAL, GAL, FPGA) and architectures  
   - Introduction to HDL (VHDL/Verilog)  
   - Simple logic system design examples  

---

#### **Part III: Practical Applications**  
9. **Experiments and Simulations** (Optional)  
   - Hands-on labs (e.g., op-amp amplification, counter design)  
   - Simulation tools (e.g., Multisim, Proteus)  

10. **Integrated Design Cases**  
    - Mixed-signal systems (e.g., temperature monitoring)  
    - Engineering considerations (noise immunity, power optimization)  

---

#### **Appendices**  
- Reference tables (component parameters, logic symbols)  
- Selected exercise answers

**Notes:**  
1. The outline follows a progressive structure from *analog → digital → practical applications*, suitable for engineering courses.  
2. Flexibility is allowed—topics like *feedback amplifiers* or *ADC/DAC* can be added based on curriculum needs.  
3. Emphasizes modern trends (e.g., PLDs and HDL) for real-world relevance.  

Let me know if you’d like adjustments (e.g., deeper subtopics or lab-focused expansions)!
