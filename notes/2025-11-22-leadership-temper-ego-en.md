title: Leadership's Temper, Ego, and Dignity
translated: false

That is a very insightful and crucial observation. You are absolutely correct—for anyone in a leadership position, especially a CEO or boss, being mindful of their **temper, ego, and dignity** is essential for creating a healthy, productive, and safe work environment.

The tragic case of Yoozoo Games CEO Lin Qi, who was fatally poisoned by a former executive (not the CFO, though an executive named Xu Yao who ran a subsidiary) in 2020 due to a business dispute, is an extreme and shocking reminder that workplace conflict, especially at the highest levels, can have devastating consequences. While this specific event is incredibly rare, it underscores the importance of professional conduct and managing relationships.

### 💡 Why Emotional Intelligence is Critical for Leaders

The core principle here is **Emotional Intelligence (EQ)**, which is often considered more important for leadership success than pure IQ.

* **1. Protecting Subordinate Dignity:** A key rule of leadership is to "praise in public, critique in private." Attacking a subordinate's ego or dignity through public humiliation, yelling, or belittling can lead to **resentment, disengagement, and a toxic culture** where fear, rather than trust, is the primary motivator.
* **2. Creating Psychological Safety:** Employees perform best when they feel safe to speak up, ask questions, and admit mistakes without fear of retribution. A volatile boss destroys this psychological safety, which is vital for innovation and honest feedback.
* **3. Leading by Example:** A boss sets the emotional and behavioral tone for the entire organization. If a CEO is constantly losing their temper, they are implicitly signaling that such behavior is acceptable, leading to stress and conflict throughout the ranks.
* **4. Rational Decision-Making:** Anger clouds judgment. Big, high-stakes decisions require a clear, calm mind. A leader who acts on impulse due to frustration is likely to make poor, regretted choices.

### 🔧 Strategies for Managing Temper and Conflict

Great leaders are not born without temper; they learn to manage it. Here are some strategies that executives and leaders can use:

| Area | Strategy for the Boss/CEO |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Self-Awareness** | **Pause & Reflect:** When you feel anger rising, *pause*. Take a deep breath. Remove yourself from the situation if necessary (e.g., step out of the room). |
| **Communication** | **Focus on the Problem, Not the Person:** When correcting an employee, use "I" statements and focus on the *behavior* or *outcome*, not their personal failings. |
| **Conflict Resolution** | **Seek Mutual Solutions:** Approach disagreements with a goal to find a win-win or a mutually beneficial solution, prioritizing collaboration over confrontation. |
| **Stress Management** | **Prioritize Well-being:** Ensure you have healthy outlets for stress (exercise, sleep, mindfulness/meditation). High stress is a common trigger for a short temper. |
| **Seeking Feedback** | **Get a Coach/Mentor:** Work with an executive coach or a trusted mentor for honest, private feedback on your communication style and emotional reactions. |

By managing one's own emotional state and treating all colleagues with respect, a leader fosters a workplace built on mutual trust and professionalism, which is the bedrock of long-term success.
