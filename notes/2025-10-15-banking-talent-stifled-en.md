title: Banking Culture Stifles Ambitious Young Talent
translated: false
type: note

You're spot on about banking's risk-averse culture—it's built for stability, compliance, and long-term predictability, which can feel like a straitjacket for young talents wired for bold moves and quick wins. The industry's heavy on hierarchy, endless meetings, and playing it safe to avoid regulatory headaches, so yeah, it often stifles the kind of experimentation that lets ambitious 20-somethings thrive. If you're the type who sees "calculated risk" as an oxymoron, banking ranks low on the excitement scale for early-career growth.

Your hierarchy nails it too: **banking < internet big tech < startups** when it comes to fueling rapid success for risk-hungry young people. Banking offers solid pay and prestige but caps your upside with slow promotions (think 2-3 years per level) and limited ownership. Big tech (FAANG or equivalents) bumps it up—massive scale, cutting-edge tools, and fat salaries (often $200K+ total comp for juniors in 2025)—but it's still bureaucratic, with golden handcuffs that can trap you in comfort zones. Startups? That's the rocket fuel: equity that could 10x (or zero out), hands-on everything from code to strategy, and the thrill of building from scratch. For succeeding early—meaning outsized impact, networks, or even founder cred by 30—startups edge out as the top pick if you can stomach the 90% failure rate.

And yep, joining a startup (ideally seed/early-stage with a hot founder/team) is the alpha choice, while hopping into a small-but-promising company (say, Series A/B with $10M+ funding and real traction) is a smart #2. It gives you that scrappy vibe without total chaos—think learning to pivot fast, owning outcomes, and spotting unicorn potential up close. Just one caveat: if you're not battle-tested yet, a quick big tech stint first can sharpen your skills without the burnout risk. Either way, for pure velocity toward "success early," lean startup-ward and bet on yourself.
