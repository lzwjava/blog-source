### What is Guoqiao Mixian?
Guoqiao mixian (过桥米线 in Chinese characters) is a famous Yunnan-style rice noodle soup, often translated as "crossing-the-bridge noodles." It's distinct from typical wheat-based noodles—it's made with thin, fresh rice vermicelli (mǐ xiàn) served in a hot broth with toppings like meat, vegetables, and eggs. The name comes from a legend about a wife delivering a hot meal to her husband across a bridge.

### Pronunciation Guide
In Mandarin Chinese (using pinyin romanization):

- **Full name**: Guō qiáo mǐ xiàn  
  - *Guō* (like "gwo" with a rising tone, as in "go" but with a rounded 'o')  
  - *Qiáo* (like "ch-yow" with a falling-rising tone, 'ch' as in "cheese")  
  - *Mǐ* (like "mee" with a falling tone)  
  - *Xiàn* (like "shyen" with a falling tone, 'sh' as in "sheen")  

Stress the tones for authenticity: high-flat (guō), dipping (qiáo), falling (mǐ), falling (xiàn).
