### Impact of Screen On/Off on iOS Personal Hotspot

The iOS Personal Hotspot feature (assuming that's what you meant by "personal hubspot," as it's a common iPhone function for sharing your cellular internet connection) is designed to remain active even when the iPhone's screen is off or locked. According to Apple's official documentation and tutorials, the hotspot should continue functioning in the background without interruption from the screen state, as long as devices are connected and using it.

However, based on user reports and forum discussions, there can be issues with connection stability when the screen turns off:
- In some cases, the hotspot may disconnect or become unavailable after the screen locks, especially if there's perceived inactivity (e.g., no data transfer for a short period) or due to battery-saving behaviors. This seems more common in older iOS versions (like iOS 15 or earlier) or specific setups, such as using 5G. It doesn't always happen, but it's a frequent complaint.
- To mitigate this, common workarounds include:
  - Setting Auto-Lock to "Never" in Settings > Display & Brightness (this keeps the screen on indefinitely, preventing lock-related issues, but drains battery faster).
  - Keeping the Personal Hotspot settings page open on your iPhone before locking the screen.
  - Using Siri to enable the hotspot while the screen is already off (e.g., say "Turn on Personal Hotspot"), which some users report keeps it active longer without auto-shutdown.
- If no devices are connected, the hotspot may automatically turn off after about 90 seconds of inactivity when the screen is off, as a power-saving measure. But if actively in use, it should stay on.

Regarding speed: There's no evidence or reports indicating that the screen being on or off directly affects the hotspot's internet speed. Speed is more influenced by factors like cellular signal strength, network congestion, whether you're using 5G vs. LTE, the number of connected devices, or enabling Low Power Mode (which can throttle performance to save battery). Screen state doesn't appear to impact bandwidth or latency when the connection is stable.

If you're experiencing disconnections or slow speeds, try restarting your iPhone, updating to the latest iOS, disabling Low Power Mode, or resetting network settings (Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Network Settings). For persistent issues, check your carrier's data plan limits or contact Apple Support.
