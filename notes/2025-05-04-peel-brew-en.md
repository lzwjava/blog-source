Brewing dried tangerine peel (陈皮) can be done with either hot or cold water, depending on your preference and the desired flavor. Here's a quick guide for both methods:

### Hot Water Brewing
1. **Prepare the Peel**: Rinse 3-5 grams of dried tangerine peel under running water to remove dust or impurities. Optionally, soak it in warm water for 5-10 minutes to soften.
2. **Brew**: Place the peel in a teapot or cup. Pour 200-250 ml of hot water (around 85-95°C, just below boiling) over the peel.
3. **Steep**: Let it steep for 5-10 minutes. Longer steeping intensifies the flavor.
4. **Serve**: Strain (if desired) and drink. You can add honey or sugar for sweetness or combine with tea (e.g., pu-erh or green tea) for a richer flavor.
5. **Note**: Hot water extracts the peel’s aromatic oils and flavors quickly, giving a warm, citrusy, and slightly bitter taste.

### Cold Water Brewing
1. **Prepare the Peel**: Rinse 3-5 grams of dried tangerine peel as above.
2. **Brew**: Place the peel in a glass or bottle with 300-500 ml of cold or room-temperature water.
3. **Steep**: Let it sit for 4-8 hours (or overnight) in the refrigerator for a smoother, milder flavor.
4. **Serve**: Drink as is or with a touch of honey. The peel can be left in for stronger flavor over time.
5. **Note**: Cold brewing results in a lighter, refreshing taste with less bitterness, ideal for hot weather.

### Tips
- **Hot Water**: Best for a quick, robust infusion, especially in cooler weather or for medicinal purposes (e.g., aiding digestion).
- **Cold Water**: Better for a subtle, refreshing drink, suitable for hydration or casual sipping.
- **Reuse**: The peel can often be brewed 2-3 times, especially with hot water, as it retains flavor.
- **Storage**: Store unused dried tangerine peel in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.

Choose based on your taste and purpose—hot for a cozy, intense flavor; cold for a crisp, gentle infusion.
