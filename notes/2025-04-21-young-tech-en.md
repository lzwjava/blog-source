### Comparison to Palm, Wang, and Hotz
- **Cornelius Palm** (Happyr Health): Like Palm, who founded Happyr Health to address chronic pain through tech, Archer and Liu focus on niche, impactful problems (personalized memorials and VR cameras). Palm’s healthtech focus aligns with Russell’s LIDAR for safety.
- **Alexandr Wang** (Scale AI): Wang, who founded Scale AI at 19 and became a billionaire by 25, shares similarities with Russell and Buterin, who also built billion-dollar tech at young ages. Wang’s AI data labeling mirrors Perkins’ scalable, user-focused tech.[](https://www.entrepreneur.com/entrepreneurs/15-young-founders-rethinking-everything-from-artificial/432612)[](https://studyinternational.com/news/youngest-entrepreneurs-education/)
- **George Hotz** (comma.ai): Hotz, known for hacking and founding comma.ai for self-driving tech, parallels Russell’s autonomous vehicle work and Liu’s hardware innovation. Hotz’s DIY ethos resonates with Buterin’s decentralized vision.[](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemontgomery/2016/11/03/the-cautionary-tale-of-george-hotz-and-the-self-driving-car/)[](https://lookupbio.com/george-hotz/)

### Notes
- These entrepreneurs were selected for their age (under 30 at time of major success), tech innovation, and significant impact (e.g., billion-dollar valuations, widespread adoption). 
- I excluded older founders (e.g., Mark Zuckerberg, now 40) and focused on those who achieved success in their 20s, like the referenced trio.
- Some ages are estimated based on birth years or success timelines, as exact current ages may vary slightly.
- If you’d like me to dig deeper into any of these individuals, analyze their companies, or find more examples (e.g., via web or X posts), let me know! I can also explore specific regions or tech sectors.

Would you like me to generate a visual chart comparing their net worths or company valuations, or focus on another aspect (e.g., their tech stacks, funding rounds)?
