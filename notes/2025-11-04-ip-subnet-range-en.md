Yes, that's correct. The IP address `192.168.1.35/24` belongs to the subnet `192.168.1.0/24`, which spans the full range of 256 addresses: from `192.168.1.0` (network address) to `192.168.1.255` (broadcast address).

### Quick Breakdown:
- **/24** means a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`, fixing the first three octets (`192.168.1`) and allowing the last octet to vary from 0 to 255.
- Usable host addresses: `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254` (excluding network and broadcast).
- Your specific host (`192.168.1.35`) is just one address within that range.

If you need to calculate subnets for a different prefix or verify with a tool, let me know!
