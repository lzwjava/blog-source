Yes, Elon Musk and Donald Trump appear to have recently reconciled and met amicably at Charlie Kirk's memorial service on September 21, 2025, in Arizona. This came just weeks after Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025, during a Turning Point USA event in Utah. The gathering brought together many conservative figures, and their interaction— including a handshake and brief conversation—marked the first public sighting of the two together since their public falling out in June 2025 over disagreements related to Trump's administration and Musk's role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Lip readers analyzing footage reported Trump saying, "I've missed you," to Musk, while Musk reportedly urged unity amid the shared grief over Kirk's death. Trump later downplayed it to reporters as a casual hello, but sources close to the event described it as a positive step toward mending ties, with Kirk's influence as a mutual ally credited for facilitating the moment. No major announcements came from the meeting, but it signals a potential thaw in their once-close relationship.
