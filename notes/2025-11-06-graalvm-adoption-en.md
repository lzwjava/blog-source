### GraalVM's Famous Uses
GraalVM is primarily renowned for its **ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation** capabilities, which allow developers to compile Java (and other JVM-based languages like Kotlin, Scala, or even polyglot code in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, etc.) into standalone native executables. This results in:
- **Ultra-fast startup times** (often sub-second, vs. minutes for traditional JVM apps).
- **Lower memory footprint** (reduced runtime overhead, ideal for containerized environments).
- **High performance** at runtime, sometimes surpassing traditional JIT-compiled JVMs.

Its fame exploded in the cloud-native era, especially for **microservices, serverless functions (e.g., on AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions), and edge computing**, where resource efficiency is critical. It's also popular for embedding languages (e.g., running JS or Python inside Java apps) without performance penalties.

### Adoption by Other Projects
Yes, GraalVM is widely integrated into numerous open-source and enterprise projects, making it a cornerstone for modern JVM ecosystems. Here's a quick overview of notable adopters:

| Project/Framework | Use Case | Why GraalVM? |
|-------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Quarkus** | Kubernetes-native Java apps | Native compilation for fast boot times in containers; official GraalVM support since v1.0. |
| **Micronaut** | Microservices framework | Built-in GraalVM integration for low-memory, high-throughput services. |
| **Helidon** (Oracle) | Cloud-native web apps | Leverages GraalVM for reactive, lightweight MP (MicroProfile) implementations. |
| **Spring Native** (Spring Boot extension) | Enterprise Java apps | Experimental AOT mode for faster Spring apps; used in production by companies like Alibaba. |
| **Vert.x** | Reactive toolkit | Polyglot support for event-driven apps with JS/Python interop. |
| **JHipster** | Full-stack generator | Generates GraalVM-compatible apps for rapid prototyping. |
| **Elastic APM** | Application monitoring | Uses GraalVM for agent efficiency in distributed tracing. |

Beyond frameworks, it's adopted by big players like **Oracle** (its creator, integrated into Oracle Cloud), **Twitter** (for low-latency services), **Red Hat** (OpenJDK builds), and **Google** (experimental in some internal tools). As of 2025, community metrics show over 10,000+ GitHub repos explicitly using it, per adoption trackers.
