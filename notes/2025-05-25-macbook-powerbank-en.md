title: Charging MacBook Air with Power Bank

Yes, you can use a 5000mAh Type-C power bank to charge a MacBook Air 2022 (M2, 13.6-inch), but there are significant limitations to consider:

1. **Insufficient Capacity**: A 5000mAh power bank has a limited capacity, typically around 18.5Wh (at 3.7V). The MacBook Air M2 has a 52.6Wh battery, meaning a 5000mAh power bank can only provide a partial charge, likely less than 30-35% of the MacBook’s battery, accounting for energy loss during charging (efficiency is typically 80-90%). This makes it impractical for fully charging the MacBook or sustaining heavy usage.

2. **Power Delivery (PD) Requirements**: The MacBook Air M2 supports USB-C Power Delivery (PD) for charging, requiring at least 30W for standard charging and up to 70W for fast charging. Most 5000mAh power banks output 15W (5V/3A) or 20W at best, which is below the MacBook’s optimal charging requirements. While it can still charge the MacBook, it will do so very slowly, especially if the laptop is in use. You’d need a power bank that supports USB-C PD with at least 30W output for efficient charging.[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-usb-c-battery-packs-and-power-banks/)[](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102378)

3. **Practicality**: A 5000mAh power bank is better suited for charging smaller devices like smartphones or earbuds. For a MacBook Air, a power bank with at least 20,000mAh and 30W+ PD output is recommended to provide a full charge or close to it. For example, tests show that a 20,000mAh power bank can charge an M2 MacBook Air to around 60-90% depending on the model and efficiency.[](https://www.macworld.com/article/2395511/best-laptop-power-banks-for-macbook.html)[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-usb-c-battery-packs-and-power-banks/)

4. **Safety and Compatibility**: Ensure the power bank supports USB-C PD and is from a reputable brand (e.g., Anker, Ugreen, Baseus) to avoid damaging the MacBook. Low-quality power banks may not deliver stable power, which could harm the battery over time. The MacBook Air M2 can be charged via its USB-C ports (or MagSafe 3), but you’ll need a USB-C cable that supports PD charging.[](https://www.macworld.com/article/819438/best-macbook-usb-c-charger.html)[](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255488263)

5. **Usage Notes**: If you use the MacBook while charging with a 5000mAh power bank, the power bank’s output may not keep up with the MacBook’s power consumption, leading to slow charging or even battery drain. For best results, charge the MacBook in sleep mode or when powered off.

**Recommendation**: A 5000mAh power bank is not ideal for charging a MacBook Air M2 due to its low capacity and likely insufficient power output. For travel or extended use, consider a power bank with at least 20,000mAh and 30-65W USB-C PD output, such as the Anker PowerCore+ 26,800mAh (45W PD) or Ugreen 20,000mAh (65W PD), which can charge the MacBook more effectively.[](https://www.macworld.com/article/2395511/best-laptop-power-banks-for-macbook.html)[](https://www.igeeksblog.com/best-usb-c-power-banks-for-macbook/)

If you’re in a pinch and only have a 5000mAh power bank, it can provide a small boost to the battery, but it won’t be sufficient for significant charging needs. Always check the power bank’s specifications for USB-C PD support and wattage before use.
