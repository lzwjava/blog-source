I’m assuming you’re asking about making **soybean milk** or a **bean-based paste** (like red bean paste) using a Joyoung soy milk maker, as this is one of its primary functions. Since you mentioned "bean" without specifying, I’ll focus on making **soy milk** with soybeans, as it’s the most common use, and briefly cover **red bean paste** as an alternative. If you meant a different type of bean or preparation, please clarify, and I’ll tailor the response!

### Making Soy Milk with a Joyoung Soy Milk Maker
Joyoung soy milk makers (e.g., models like DJ13U-D81SG or Y521) are designed to simplify the process of making soy milk from soybeans. Here’s a step-by-step guide based on common usage and recipes:[](https://dianarambles.com/joyoung/)[](https://omnivorescookbook.com/homemade-soy-milk/)

#### Ingredients:
- 60–100 grams (1/2 to 1 cup) dry soybeans (non-GMO preferred)
- Water (900–1200 ml, depending on model capacity)
- Optional: Sugar, black sesame, peanuts, or other flavorings (e.g., vanilla, agave)

#### Equipment:
- Joyoung Soy Milk Maker (any model, e.g., DJ13U-D81SG, Y521, or DJ12U-A903SG)
- Measuring cup (often included with the machine)
- Fine mesh strainer or nut milk bag (optional, for smoother texture)
- Glass or ceramic container for storage

#### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Soybeans**:
   - Measure 60–100 grams of dry soybeans (check your model’s manual for exact amounts; 60 grams typically yields ~1 liter of soy milk).
   - Rinse the soybeans thoroughly under tap water to remove any debris.
   - Soak the soybeans in water for 6–8 hours (or overnight) to soften them. This step is optional for some Joyoung models (e.g., DJ12U-A903SG), which can handle dry beans, but soaking improves texture and flavor.[](https://dianarambles.com/joyoung/)[](https://www.joyoung.com.sg/page.aspx?page=recipes)

2. **Set Up the Joyoung Machine**:
   - Fill the machine’s reservoir with purified water to the marked line (usually 900–1200 ml, depending on the model).
   - Drain the soaked soybeans and add them to the machine’s blending cup or directly into the main compartment, depending on your model’s design.[](https://dianarambles.com/joyoung/)

3. **Select the Function**:
   - Press the “Soy Milk” or “Soymilk” function on the machine’s control panel. For models like DJ13U-D81SG, select the “Soybean” setting and press “Start/Cancel.”[](https://en.huarenstore.com/blogging/?cat=65)
   - The machine will automatically heat, grind, and cook the soybeans. The process typically takes 20–32 minutes, depending on the model.[](https://en.huarenstore.com/blogging/?cat=65)[](https://dianarambles.com/joyoung/)

4. **Check the Result**:
   - When the machine beeps or the light flickers, the soy milk is ready. You’ll notice a rich, nutty aroma. The Joyoung produces fine bean pulp (okara), so straining is often unnecessary, but you can use a nut milk bag for smoother milk if desired.[](https://en.huarenstore.com/blogging/?cat=65)[](https://dianarambles.com/joyoung/)
   - If you want to strain, let the milk cool slightly, then pour it through a fine mesh strainer or nut milk bag into a glass or ceramic container. Avoid plastic if the milk is still hot.[](https://omnivorescookbook.com/homemade-soy-milk/)

5. **Optional Flavoring**:
   - Add sugar, honey, or other sweeteners to taste after the milk is done. You can also blend in ingredients like black sesame, peanuts, or rolled oats during the process for varied flavors (e.g., walnut soy milk or oat milk).[](https://en.huarenstore.com/blogging/?cat=65)[](https://atestanswers.com/file/black-sesame-paste-recipe-joyoung)
   - For a richer taste, reboil the filtered soy milk in a clean pot, stirring slowly over low heat.[](https://en.huarenstore.com/blogging/?cat=65)

6. **Store and Clean**:
   - Store the soy milk in an airtight glass jar in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Shake before using.[](https://dianarambles.com/joyoung/)
   - Clean the Joyoung immediately after use while it’s still warm to easily remove bean pulp. Alternatively, soak it with hot water before washing.[](https://omnivorescookbook.com/homemade-soy-milk/)

7. **Use the Okara (Bean Pulp)**:
   - The leftover bean pulp (okara) is nutritious and can be used in recipes like pancakes, stir-fries, or baked goods. For example, mix with flour, egg, and green onions for savory pancakes.[](https://omnivorescookbook.com/homemade-soy-milk/)

#### Notes:
- **Cost Efficiency**: Homemade soy milk costs ~$0.78 per gallon compared to ~$21.78 for store-bought organic soy milk, plus it avoids additives and packaging waste.[](https://dianarambles.com/joyoung/)
- **Model-Specific Tips**: Check your model’s manual for exact water and bean ratios. Some models (e.g., DJ13M-D81SG) have a “Delicious Porridge” function for grainy textures, which can be useful for bean pastes.[](https://en.huarenstore.com/blogging/?cat=65)
- **Health Benefits**: Soy milk is rich in protein, fiber, and calcium and may help prevent diabetes, hypertension, and other conditions.[](https://en.huarenstore.com/blogging/?cat=65)

### Making Red Bean Paste with a Joyoung Soy Milk Maker
If you meant **red bean paste** (Hong Dou Sha or Anko), the Joyoung can simplify the process, though it’s not its primary function. Here’s how to adapt it based on available recipes:[](https://en.huarenstore.com/blogging/?cat=65)[](https://enhuarenstore.blogspot.com/2015/05/joyoung-recipes-red-bean-paste.html)

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup adzuki (red) beans
- Water (for boiling, ~3 cups)
- 100–200 grams rock sugar or granulated sugar (adjust to taste)
- Optional: Tangerine peel, butter, or coconut oil for flavor and texture

#### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Beans**:
   - Rinse 1 cup of adzuki beans and soak overnight (6–8 hours) to soften. Drain and rinse again.[](https://enhuarenstore.blogspot.com/2015/05/joyoung-recipes-red-bean-paste.html)

2. **Cook the Beans**:
   - Place the soaked beans and optional tangerine peel in a pot with ~3 cups of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then simmer on low for 60–90 minutes until soft. Alternatively, use a pressure cooker for 20–22 minutes to speed up the process.[](https://omnivorescookbook.com/how-to-make-red-bean-paste/)[](https://www.rivertenkitchen.com/sweet-bean-paste-recipe.html)
   - **Using Joyoung**: While the Joyoung isn’t explicitly designed for red bean paste, you can use the “Delicious Porridge” or “Grains” function to cook the beans with water. Add the beans and water (to the machine’s fill line), then select the appropriate setting. This takes ~20–30 minutes.[](https://en.huarenstore.com/blogging/?cat=65)

3. **Sweeten and Blend**:
   - Once the beans are soft, drain excess water. Add rock sugar or granulated sugar to taste (100 grams for less sweet, 200 grams for sweeter, dessert-style paste).[](https://omnivorescookbook.com/how-to-make-red-bean-paste/)
   - For a chunky paste (tsubuan), mash the beans lightly with a spoon or in the Joyoung using a short “Blend” cycle. For a smooth paste (koshian), transfer the cooked beans to a blender or food processor and blend until fine.[](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-anko-red-bean-paste/)
   - If using the Joyoung for blending, ensure the beans are cooled slightly to avoid damaging the machine, and use the “Jam” or “Paste” function if available.[](https://atestanswers.com/file/black-sesame-paste-recipe-joyoung)

4. **Refine the Paste**:
   - Transfer the mashed or blended beans to a pan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens to a paste-like consistency (~5–10 minutes). Add 1–2 tablespoons of butter or coconut oil for a creamier texture (optional).[](https://redhousespice.com/red-bean-paste/)
   - Cool the paste in the fridge for a firmer texture, ideally overnight.[](https://allpurposeveggies.com/21857/sweet-red-bean-paste/)

5. **Store and Use**:
   - Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 2 months.[](https://www.cooking-therapy.com/red-bean-paste/)
   - Use in desserts like mochi, red bean buns, mooncakes, or as a topping for ice cream or shaved ice.[](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/red-bean-paste-guide)

#### Notes:
- **Time-Saving**: The Joyoung reduces cooking time compared to traditional stovetop methods, especially with its porridge or paste functions.[](https://enhuarenstore.blogspot.com/2015/05/joyoung-recipes-red-bean-paste.html)
- **Texture**: For a grainy texture, use the Joyoung’s “Delicious Porridge” function (available on models like DJ13M-D81SG). For smoother paste, blend separately.[](https://en.huarenstore.com/blogging/?cat=65)
- **Customization**: Adjust sugar levels based on use (less for savory dishes, more for desserts). Add tangerine peel for a traditional Chinese flavor.[](https://enhuarenstore.blogspot.com/2015/05/joyoung-recipes-red-bean-paste.html)

### General Tips for Using Joyoung:
- **Read the Manual**: Different models (e.g., DJ13U-D81SG, Y521) have specific functions like “Soy Milk,” “Grains,” “Jam,” or “Paste.” Check which applies to your recipe.[](https://atestanswers.com/file/black-sesame-paste-recipe-joyoung)
- **Avoid Overloading**: Stick to recommended ingredient amounts to prevent clogging or overflow.[](https://atestanswers.com/file/black-sesame-paste-recipe-joyoung)
- **Cleaning**: Wash immediately after use to avoid stuck-on residue. Soak with hot water if needed.[](https://omnivorescookbook.com/homemade-soy-milk/)
- **Versatility**: The Joyoung can also make other bean-based drinks or pastes (e.g., black sesame paste, mung bean paste) using similar steps. For black sesame paste, use the “Paste” function with soaked sesame seeds and sugar.[](https://atestanswers.com/file/black-sesame-paste-recipe-joyoung)

### If You Meant Something Else:
- If you’re referring to a specific bean (e.g., black beans, mung beans) or a different preparation (e.g., black bean paste for jjajangmyeon), please provide more details, and I’ll adjust the instructions.
- For **black bean paste** (e.g., for Korean jjajangmyeon), the Joyoung can assist by cooking black beans with its “Grains” function, but you’ll need to blend them with ingredients like soy sauce, rice wine, and cornstarch separately, as it’s a savory paste not typically made in a soy milk maker.[](https://www.maangchi.com/talk/topic/how-to-make-black-bean-paste)
- If you want a visual guide, I can search for a video tutorial or generate a chart of ingredient ratios if needed—just let me know!
