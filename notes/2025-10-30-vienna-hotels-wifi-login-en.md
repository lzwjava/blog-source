The WiFi at Vienna Hotels (part of the Jinjiang International group) uses a standard captive portal system for guest authentication, common in Chinese hotels. The gateway IP (172.16.16.1) is the internal router address, and accessing it (or any non-HTTPS site) redirects you to the login page at portal.jinjianghotels.com.cn. Here's how the SMS-based login typically works—it's straightforward and secure for basic browsing, though some users worry about data privacy (it's hotel-managed, so use a VPN if paranoid).

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Connect to the WiFi network**: On your device (phone, laptop, etc.), scan for and join the hotel's WiFi SSID (often something like "Vienna_Free_WiFi" or "Jinjiang_WiFi"). No password is usually needed to join.

2. **Trigger the portal**: Open any web browser and try loading a site (e.g., google.com or baidu.com). You'll be automatically redirected to the Jinjiang portal page (it might take a few seconds; if not, manually type `http://172.16.16.1` or `http://portal.jinjianghotels.com.cn` in the address bar). The page is in Chinese, but you can use Google Translate or similar for help.

3. **Choose authentication method**: The portal offers a few options, like:
   - SMS verification (短信验证—simplest for most guests).
   - Social login (e.g., Weibo, QQ).
   - Sometimes a one-click option if you're a registered Jinjiang member.

4. **SMS login specifics**:
   - Select the SMS option.
   - Enter your mobile phone number (Chinese numbers start with +86; international numbers like +1 for US should work but may incur roaming fees for the SMS).
   - Click "Send code" (发送验证码). You'll receive a 4-6 digit code via text from the hotel's system (usually instant, from a shortcode like 106XXXX).
   - Input the code on the portal.
   - Click "Confirm" or "Connect" (立即连接). If valid, you'll get full internet access for 24 hours (or until check-out).

### Tips & Troubleshooting:
- **No redirect?** Forget the network, reconnect, and clear your browser cache/cookies. On mobile, toggle airplane mode briefly.
- **Code not arriving?** Check signal (hotel WiFi is separate from mobile data), wait 60 seconds for retry, or ask front desk for help—they often have a shared code.
- **Foreign number issues?** It works for most international carriers, but if blocked, try social login or request a room voucher from staff.
- **Speed/Security**: Expect decent speeds post-login, but it's public—avoid sensitive logins without VPN. No major scam reports for this portal.

If you're stuck on-site, front desk staff can demo it (bring your phone). For more visuals, search "锦江酒店 WiFi 登录" on Douyin (Chinese TikTok) for quick videos.
