Kary Mullis, the Nobel Prize-winning inventor of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, was a vocal skeptic of the mainstream scientific consensus that HIV directly causes AIDS. He argued that there was no conclusive proof linking HIV to the disease and viewed AIDS not as a single condition caused by one virus, but as a syndrome resulting from multiple factors, including exposure to a broad range of retroviruses (the family that includes HIV).

### Key Elements of Mullis's Views:
- **Lack of Proof**: Mullis claimed he extensively searched scientific literature but could not find a definitive paper or study establishing HIV as the sole cause of AIDS. In his 1998 autobiography *Dancing Naked in the Mind Field*, he described this realization while working on an HIV-related PCR test project, leading him to question the paradigm.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: He proposed that AIDS is an "arbitrary diagnosis" applied when HIV antibodies are detected in the blood, rather than a direct viral causation. Instead, he suggested the syndrome arises from an overload of various retroviruses (not just HIV) on the immune system, exacerbated by modern behaviors like promiscuity or drug use that increase exposure to multiple strains. Retroviruses, he noted, have coexisted with humans for millennia (e.g., as endogenous elements in our DNA) without causing epidemics until recently.
- **Criticism of Research**: Mullis accused AIDS researchers of "spinning their wheels" by fixating on HIV as a single "pseudo-species" (due to its rapid mutation), ignoring the broader retrovirus genus. He believed this narrow focus wasted decades and hindered effective treatments, as drugs and tests targeted only HIV variants, not the full problem.
- **Direct Quote**: One of his most famous statements encapsulates this: "It's not even probable, let alone scientifically proven, that HIV causes AIDS."

Mullis's ideas aligned him with AIDS denialism, a fringe position that influenced figures like South African President Thabo Mbeki, contributing to delayed treatments and excess deaths in the early 2000s. However, his views have been widely debunked by the scientific community, with abundant evidence from decades of research confirming HIV as the primary cause of AIDS.
