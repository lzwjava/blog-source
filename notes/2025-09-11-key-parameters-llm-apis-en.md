Absolutely—no tables, just clear and neat explanations. Here's a streamlined breakdown of the key parameters available when working with LLM APIs (like OpenAI’s or Copilot-like systems):

## Common Parameters in LLM “Chat Completion” APIs

These are the key components you’ll typically pass when making a request—either to OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or systems derived from them (like Copilot in some contexts):

### 1. **`model`**

Specifies which language model to use (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, etc.). It dictates quality, speed, and cost.

### 2. **`messages`**

An array of chat messages structured like:

```json
[
  {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short story"}
]
```

Each message has a `role` (`user`, `assistant`, or `system`) and `content`.

### 3. **`temperature`**

Controls randomness:

* **Low (0–0.3)**: Very deterministic; safe for factual or precise responses.
* **Medium (0.4–0.7)**: Balanced—useful for general writing or code tasks.
* **High (0.8–1.2)**: More creative; ideal for brainstorming or stories.
  Often defaults to around 0.7. ([Microsoft Learn][1])

### 4. **`top_p` (nucleus sampling)**

Another way to manage randomness. Instead of looking at all tokens, the model samples from a dynamic subset representing the cumulative probability mass. Typically, you adjust **either** `temperature` or `top_p`, not both simultaneously. ([Microsoft Learn][2])

## Additional Frequently-Seen Parameters

Depending on the API and your use case, you might also encounter:

* **`n`**: Number of responses to generate (e.g., return 2–5 alternatives).
* **`stop`**: Up to four strings where the model will cease generation if encountered.
* **`max_tokens`**: Caps the length of the generated response.
* **`stream`**: If set to true, results come token-by-token for real-time flows.
* **`user`**: A string to identify which user is making the request, often for tracking or usage analytics.

## About GitHub Copilot “API”

GitHub Copilot currently doesn’t offer developers a direct API for code completions (like OpenAI’s endpoints) to control parameters like `temperature`, `messages`, etc. ([Stack Overflow][3]). So if you're referring to “Copilot API,” you're likely talking about the general pattern used by typical LLM “chat completion” endpoints—not something public for Copilot.

## Collated Parameters (No Table, Just Bullets)

* **Required**:

  * `model`
  * `messages`

* **Common tuning knobs**:

  * `top_p`
  * (Use one at a time)

* **Additional controls**:

  * `n`
  * `stop`
  * `max_tokens`
  * `stream`
  * `user`
