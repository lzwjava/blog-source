To share videos securely without worrying about unauthorized downloading or copying, you can use a combination of technical measures and access controls. Here are some effective strategies:

1. **Use a Secure Video Hosting Platform with DRM**:
   - Platforms like Vimeo Pro, Wistia, or Brightcove offer Digital Rights Management (DRM) features, which encrypt videos and restrict downloading. Vimeo, for example, allows you to disable downloads and set domain restrictions so the video can only be viewed on specific websites.
   - Choose platforms that support password protection or single-sign-on (SSO) for added security.

2. **Stream Instead of Sharing Files**:
   - Avoid sending raw video files (e.g., MP4s). Instead, use streaming services that deliver content in chunks, making it harder to download the entire file. Platforms like YouTube (with unlisted or private links) or Cloudflare Stream can help.
   - Enable HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) with encryption to ensure the video is only accessible to authorized viewers.

3. **Restrict Access with Authentication**:
   - Require viewers to log in with unique credentials to access the video. Platforms like Thinkific or Teachable, designed for online courses, allow you to create user-specific access and track viewing activity.
   - Use expiring links or time-limited access to ensure videos are only available for a specific period.

4. **Watermarking and Visible Identifiers**:
   - Add dynamic watermarks with the viewer’s name or email overlaid on the video. This discourages sharing, as any leaked content can be traced back to the individual. Services like Wistia or DRM-protected platforms often support this.
   - You can also embed invisible forensic watermarks to track unauthorized distribution.

5. **Disable Download and Screen Recording**:
   - Use platforms that block right-click downloads or limit video access to specific devices or IP addresses.
   - To deter screen recording, consider tools like Cincopa, which can detect and block certain screen capture software, though no solution is entirely foolproof.

6. **Host Videos on a Private Server with Access Controls**:
   - If you prefer more control, host videos on a private server (e.g., AWS S3 with CloudFront) and use signed URLs that expire after a set time. This requires some technical setup but ensures only authorized users can access the content.
   - Combine this with a custom-built course platform or LMS (Learning Management System) to manage access.

7. **Monitor and Limit Sharing**:
   - Track how many times a video is viewed or from which devices/locations. Platforms like Vimeo and Wistia provide analytics to detect suspicious activity.
   - Limit the number of devices or simultaneous streams per user account.

8. **Legal Agreements**:
   - Have students sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) or terms of use before granting access. While not a technical barrier, this adds a legal deterrent against unauthorized sharing.

**Recommended Workflow for Your Case**:
Based on your experience sharing videos privately via a paid model, I suggest using Vimeo Pro or Wistia. Upload your videos, enable password protection, disable downloads, and share unlisted links with your student. Use dynamic watermarks with their name/email for traceability. Combine this with a platform like Teachable to manage payments, access, and communication (instead of relying solely on WeChat). For practice assignments, use Google Forms or a simple LMS to collect submissions and provide feedback securely.

No method is 100% secure, as determined users can bypass protections (e.g., screen recording). However, combining these measures significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized downloading or copying while maintaining a smooth experience for your students. If you’d like, I can search for additional tools or provide setup details for a specific platform. Let me know!
