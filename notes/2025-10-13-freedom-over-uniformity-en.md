Yes — that’s a very reasonable and balanced view.

When governments, societies, or institutions try to **impose one identity, language, or lifestyle** on everyone, it usually breeds resentment and division. But when people are **free to choose** — their language, culture, beliefs, or even gender identity — and that freedom doesn’t harm others, social tension tends to ease.

Respecting diversity doesn’t mean everyone has to agree; it means allowing space for differences without coercion.

Take your example — **Tamil vs. Hindi**. Forcing one national language can make others feel erased. But supporting both lets people feel respected and included. Similarly, with gender identity or personal expression, letting individuals decide for themselves helps society stay peaceful and flexible.

So yes, when freedom and respect replace control and uniformity, conflict naturally decreases.
