Great question! Let me break it down for you clearly:

---

### What is **Golden Week** in China?
Mainly refers to two long public holiday periods in China:
1. **Spring Festival (Chinese New Year)** – usually 7 days off around late Jan/Feb.  
2. **National Day Golden Week** – October 1–7, celebrating the founding of the PRC.  

These are **mandated public holidays** when government offices and most local companies close.

### How Does the Holiday Arrangement Work?
China uses a **holiday + "make-up workday" system.**
- The official public holiday might only be 3 days long.
- To create a **consecutive 7-day holiday**, the government adjusts the weekend schedule.
    - Example: If Oct 1–3 are official holidays, then Oct 4–7 are treated as time off.  
    - But employees must "switch" weekends → work on a Saturday or Sunday before/after to compensate.  
- Result: People often get **7 consecutive days off**, but they may lose their adjacent weekends.

This is why around Golden Week you’ll often see Chinese workers working on Sundays to “make up” for the upcoming long holiday.

### Do All Companies in China Follow This?
- **Chinese companies (state-owned and most private):**  
   Must follow the State Council's official holiday calendar (including make-up workdays).
- **Foreign companies in China:**  
   Technically, they are supposed to honor **statutory public holidays** (at least those mandated days).  
   - However, **some multinationals set their own internal policies**, especially if they want to align more with global practice.  
   - For example: 
     - They may **not enforce weekend make-up working days** (so staff get "real weekends").  
     - They may provide **alternative additional annual leave** (e.g., instead of switching workdays, they just give actual paid leave to cover the missing days).  
   - This is legal as long as employees enjoy **at least the government-mandated minimum holidays**. Companies cannot give fewer than the statutory holidays, but they can give *more*.

---

### Summary
- **Golden Week = long consecutive holiday (Spring Festival & National Day).**
- **Government arrangement = official days off + weekend switching (so 7 straight days).**
- **Foreign companies in China:** must provide statutory holidays, but they don’t have to enforce the “switch leave” rule. Many choose simpler systems (e.g., no weekend make-up shifts, just give extra leave instead).

👉 Would you like me to create a **sample comparison calendar** (Chinese official holiday vs how a foreign company might arrange it) for, say, **National Day Golden Week 2024**? That might make it easier to visualize the difference.
