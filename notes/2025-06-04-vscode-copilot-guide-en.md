## 3. Core Features of GitHub Copilot in VS Code

### 3.1 Code Completions
Copilot suggests code as you type, from single lines to entire functions or classes, based on the context of your code and file structure.
- **How It Works**:
  - Start typing in a supported language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, C#).
  - Copilot displays suggestions in grayed-out "ghost text."
  - Press **Tab** to accept a suggestion or continue typing to ignore it.
  - Use **Alt+]** (next) or **Alt+[** (previous) to cycle through multiple suggestions.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  // Calculate factorial of a number
  function factorial(n) {
  ```
  Copilot might suggest:
  ```javascript
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
  ```
  Press **Tab** to accept the suggestion.

- **Tips**:
  - Use descriptive function names or comments to guide Copilot (e.g., `// Sort an array in ascending order`).
  - For multiple suggestions, hover over the suggestion to open the Completions Panel (Ctrl+Enter) to view all options.

### 3.2 Copilot Chat
Copilot Chat allows you to interact with Copilot using natural language to ask questions, generate code, or debug issues.
- **Accessing Chat**:
  - Open the **Chat View** from the Activity Bar or use **Ctrl+Alt+I** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Ctrl+I** (macOS).
  - Alternatively, use **Inline Chat** (Ctrl+I or Cmd+I) directly in the editor for context-specific queries.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Explain Code**: Select a code block, open Inline Chat, and type `explain this code`.
  - **Generate Code**: Type `write a Python function to reverse a string` in the Chat View.
  - **Debugging**: Paste an error message into Chat and ask for a fix.
- **Example**:
  In the Chat View, type:
  ```
  What is recursion?
  ```
  Copilot responds with a detailed explanation, often including code examples in Markdown.

- **Slash Commands**:
  Use commands like `/explain`, `/doc`, `/fix`, `/tests`, or `/optimize` to specify tasks. For example:
  ```
  /explain this function
  ```
  with a selected function will generate a detailed explanation.

### 3.3 Agent Mode (Preview)
Agent Mode enables Copilot to autonomously handle multi-step coding tasks, such as creating apps, refactoring code, or writing tests.
- **How to Use**:
  - Open the **Copilot Edits View** in VS Code Insiders or Stable (if available).
  - Select **Agent** from the mode dropdown.
  - Enter a prompt, e.g., `Create a React form component with name and email fields`.
  - Copilot analyzes your codebase, suggests edits, and can run terminal commands or tests.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Generates code across multiple files.
  - Monitors errors and iterates to fix issues.
  - Integrates new libraries or migrates code to modern frameworks.

> **Note**: Agent Mode is experimental and performs best in smaller repositories. Share feedback via the VS Code GitHub repo.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode)

### 3.4 Custom Instructions
Customize Copilot to align with your coding style or project requirements.
- **Setup**:
  - Create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your workspace.
  - Add instructions in Markdown, e.g., `Use snake_case for Python variable names`.
  - Enable custom instructions in **Settings** > **GitHub** > **Copilot** > **Enable custom instructions** (VS Code 17.12 or later).
- **Example**:
  ```markdown
  # Copilot Custom Instructions
  - Use camelCase for JavaScript variables.
  - Prefer async/await over .then() for promises.
  ```
  Copilot will tailor suggestions to these preferences.

### 3.5 Workspace Context with @workspace
Use the `@workspace` command to query your entire codebase.
- **Example**:
  In the Chat View, type:
  ```
  @workspace Where is the database connection string configured?
  ```
  Copilot searches your workspace and references relevant files.

### 3.6 Next Edit Suggestions (Preview)
Copilot predicts and suggests the next logical edit based on your recent changes.
- **How It Works**:
  - As you edit code, Copilot highlights potential next edits.
  - Accept suggestions with **Tab** or modify them via Inline Chat.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for iterative refactoring or completing related code changes.

## 4. Tips and Tricks for Optimizing Copilot Usage

### 4.1 Write Effective Prompts
- Be specific: Instead of `write a function`, try `write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by the 'age' key`.
- Provide context: Include framework or library details (e.g., `use React hooks`).
- Use comments: Write `// Generate a REST API endpoint in Express` to guide completions.

### 4.2 Leverage Context
- **Reference Files/Symbols**: Use `#filename`, `#folder`, or `#symbol` in Chat prompts to scope context.
  ```
  /explain #src/utils.js
  ```
- **Drag and Drop**: Drag files or editor tabs into the Chat prompt for context.
- **Attach Images**: In VS Code 17.14 Preview 1 or later, attach screenshots to illustrate issues (e.g., UI bugs).

### 4.3 Use Slash Commands
- `/doc`: Generate documentation for a function.
- `/fix`: Suggest fixes for errors.
- `/tests`: Create unit tests for selected code.
- Example:
  ```
  /tests Generate Jest tests for this function
  ```

### 4.4 Save and Reuse Prompts
- Create a `.prompt.md` file in `.github/prompts/` to store reusable prompts.
- Example:
  ```markdown
  # React Component Prompt
  Generate a React functional component with Tailwind CSS styling. Ask for component name and props if not provided.
  ```
- Attach the prompt in Chat to reuse it across projects.

### 4.5 Choose the Right Model
- Copilot supports multiple language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet).
- Select models in the Chat View dropdown for faster coding or deeper reasoning.
- For complex tasks, Claude Sonnet may perform better in Agent Mode.[](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode)

### 4.6 Index Your Workspace
- Enable workspace indexing for faster, more accurate code searches.
- Use a remote index for GitHub repositories or a local index for large codebases.

## 5. Best Practices
- **Review Suggestions**: Always verify Copilot’s suggestions for accuracy and alignment with your project’s standards.
- **Combine with IntelliCode**: In Visual Studio, Copilot complements IntelliCode for enhanced completions.[](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/github-copilot-in-visual-studio-2022/)
