The term \\( RC \\) is called the **time constant** in the context of the capacitor voltage equation \\( V(t) = V_0 (1 - e^{-t/RC}) \\) because it governs the rate at which the capacitor charges (or discharges) in an RC circuit. Here's why:

- **Definition of \\( RC \\)**: The time constant, denoted as \\( \tau = RC \\), is the product of the resistance \\( R \\) (in ohms) and the capacitance \\( C \\) (in farads). It has units of seconds, which reflects its role as a measure of time.

- **Role in the Exponential Term**: In the equation \\( V(t) = V_0 (1 - e^{-t/RC}) \\), the exponent \\( -t/RC \\) determines how quickly the exponential term \\( e^{-t/RC} \\) decays. The time constant \\( \tau = RC \\) sets the "scale" of time in this decay process. Specifically:
  - When \\( t = RC \\), the exponent becomes \\( -t/RC = -1 \\), so \\( e^{-t/RC} = e^{-1} \approx 0.368 \\). At this point, the capacitor has charged to approximately 63.2% of its final voltage (\\( V_0 \\)) because \\( V(t) = V_0 (1 - e^{-1}) \approx 0.632 V_0 \\).
  - For larger \\( t \\), the exponential term decays further, meaning the capacitor continues to charge toward \\( V_0 \\).

- **Physical Interpretation**: The time constant \\( RC \\) represents the time it takes for the capacitor to charge to about 63.2% of the applied voltage \\( V_0 \\) (or discharge to 36.8% of its initial voltage in a discharging circuit). A larger \\( RC \\) means a slower charging process (due to higher resistance or capacitance), while a smaller \\( RC \\) means faster charging.

- **Why \\( RC \\)**? The product \\( RC \\) arises naturally from the differential equation governing the RC circuit. The voltage across the capacitor is described by:
  \\[
  \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{V_0 - V}{RC}
  \\]
  Solving this differential equation yields the exponential form \\( e^{-t/RC} \\), where \\( RC \\) appears as the characteristic time scale of the system. Physically:
  - \\( R \\) limits the current flow, slowing the charging process.
  - \\( C \\) determines how much charge the capacitor can store, affecting how long it takes to reach a given voltage.

Thus, \\( RC \\) is the time constant because it quantifies the duration required for significant charging or discharging, directly influencing the exponential behavior of the voltage \\( V(t) \\).
