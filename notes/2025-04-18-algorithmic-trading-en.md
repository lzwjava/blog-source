There are actually a lot of people doing algorithmic and AI-based trading, but there are several reasons why it's not as widely accessible or successful as it might initially seem:

1. High barriers to entry
   - Technical expertise: Requires advanced knowledge of programming, statistics, and finance
   - Capital requirements: Quality data feeds, powerful computing, and initial trading capital are expensive
   - Infrastructure needs: Low-latency connections and specialized hardware cost significant money

2. Competitive market dynamics
   - Institutional advantage: Large firms have better technology, data, and talent
   - Diminishing returns: As strategies become widely known, their effectiveness decreases
   - Zero-sum nature: For every winner, there must be a loser in many trading scenarios

3. Practical challenges
   - Market complexity: Financial markets are extremely complex adaptive systems
   - Overfitting risk: Many algorithms that work in backtesting fail in live markets
   - Constant maintenance: Markets evolve, requiring constant strategy adjustment

4. Success rates
   - Most algorithmic trading strategies fail or become unprofitable over time
   - The most successful strategies are often closely guarded secrets
   - "Survivorship bias" makes us notice the rare winners while ignoring numerous failures

The people who do succeed in this space typically have significant advantages in terms of expertise, resources, and connections that aren't available to most individuals.

AI and algorithmic trading can indeed generate significant profits, but there are several reasons why many people do not engage in it or fail to make consistent money from it:

## 1. Complexity and Expertise Required

- Developing successful AI trading algorithms requires deep expertise in both financial markets and advanced programming or machine learning techniques. This is a high barrier for most retail traders who lack the necessary skills or resources[^4][^5].
- The process involves continuous adaptation and optimization because market conditions change constantly. Algorithms that worked well in the past may become obsolete, requiring ongoing effort and expertise to update them[^4].


## 2. High Costs and Infrastructure Needs

- Building, testing, and running AI trading systems demands substantial financial investment in technology, data acquisition, and computing power. Many retail traders cannot afford these costs[^3][^5].
- Professional firms have access to superior infrastructure, real-time data feeds, and low-latency execution platforms, which retail traders typically lack. This puts individual traders at a disadvantage[^1].


## 3. Market Efficiency and Competition

- The financial markets are highly competitive and efficient. Many large hedge funds and institutional players already use sophisticated AI and algorithmic strategies, which quickly erode any edge gained by new entrants[^2].
- Algorithms often only provide a tiny, short-term edge before others discover and exploit the same patterns, making consistent profits very difficult[^1][^2].


## 4. Limitations of AI in Trading

- Current AI technologies, especially those based on large language models, struggle with understanding causality and time in markets, limiting their ability to create consistently profitable strategies[^2].
- AI is better suited to supporting roles like processing news or automating routine tasks rather than fully autonomous trading decision-making[^2].
- Many so-called "AI trading bots" available to retail investors are simplistic, rely on outdated methods, or are outright scams, leading to disappointment and losses[^2][^4].


## 5. Risks and Over-Optimization

- There is a risk of overfitting algorithms to past data, which reduces their effectiveness in real market conditions[^4].
- AI systems can fail due to technical errors or unexpected market events, causing significant losses if not carefully monitored[^5].


## 6. Regulatory and Ethical Challenges

- The regulatory environment for AI trading is still evolving, adding uncertainty and compliance costs[^5].


## Summary

While AI and algorithmic trading can be profitable, the combination of high complexity, cost, fierce competition, technological limitations, and risks means that very few individuals can successfully leverage these tools to make consistent money. Most profit opportunities are captured by large, well-resourced firms with expert teams and advanced infrastructure. Retail traders often face inferior tools, higher costs, and less reliable AI products, making profitable AI trading elusive for the average person[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5].
