Claude Haiku 4.5 is Anthropic's newest small AI model, released on October 16, 2025. It's designed for speed and efficiency, making it ideal for real-time applications like chatbots, customer service agents, and coding assistance. This model delivers near-frontier performance—matching or exceeding older models like Claude Sonnet 4 on tasks such as coding, computer use, and agent workflows—while being significantly faster (over twice the speed) and cheaper (about one-third the cost).

### Key Features and Capabilities
- **High Speed and Low Latency**: Optimized for quick responses in interactive scenarios, such as pair programming or multi-agent systems.
- **Strong in Coding and Tools**: Excels at benchmarks like SWE-bench (73.3% score) and Terminal-Bench (~41%), and it can handle complex tasks like file editing or terminal commands.
- **Multi-Model Workflows**: Pairs well with larger models like Claude Sonnet 4.5, where the bigger model plans tasks and Haiku 4.5 executes subtasks in parallel.
- **Safety Focus**: It's Anthropic's safest model yet, with low rates of harmful outputs and classified under AI Safety Level 2 (less restrictive than Level 3 for frontier models). It shows fewer misaligned behaviors than even Sonnet 4.5.

Compared to its predecessor (Claude 3.5 Haiku), it's more aligned and capable, serving as a direct drop-in replacement. It's not Anthropic's absolute latest frontier model—that's Claude Sonnet 4.5, released two weeks earlier—but Haiku 4.5 is their most recent small model and a cost-effective upgrade for everyday use.

### Pricing and Availability
- **Pricing**: $1 per million input tokens and $5 per million output tokens.
- **Access**: Available immediately to all users via the Claude API (as `claude-haiku-4-5`), Anthropic's apps, Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and integrations like GitHub Copilot.
