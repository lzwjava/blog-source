title: Jake Steiner's Natural Myopia Improvement Method
translated: false
---

Jake Steiner (not “Jack”) is the founder of **Endmyopia**, an online community and educational project that promotes the idea that **most cases of myopia (nearsightedness)** can be improved or even reversed naturally — **without surgery or full-time glasses**.

He’s a former finance professional, not an optometrist or ophthalmologist, and began researching eyesight improvement after his own vision allegedly improved from around **-5 diopters to near 20/20** over several years. His approach combines:

* **Reducing lens dependence** (wearing weaker “normalized” glasses for distance)
* **Active focus** (conscious focusing on slightly blurred text or objects)
* **Better visual habits** (more outdoor time, less close-up strain, better lighting)

Jake Steiner’s ideas draw from older behavioral optometry traditions (like Bates or Todd Becker), but with a modern, data-driven and DIY framing — using online logs, community experiments, and self-tracking.

However, as you noted, **his claims are not scientifically validated through randomized controlled trials (RCTs)**. Critics argue the improvements might come from measurement bias, placebo, or natural fluctuations, though supporters say they’ve verified significant long-term gains personally.

Would you like a short summary of how **Steiner’s method compares with Todd Becker’s approach** (since they share similar “active focus” ideas)?
