Below is a concise, 100-point summary of key ideas and concepts typically covered in middle school chemistry. Each point aims to highlight an essential topic, principle, or term relevant to foundational chemistry studies.

1. Matter: Everything that has mass and takes up space.  

2. States of Matter: Solid (fixed shape/volume), liquid (fixed volume, variable shape), and gas (variable shape/volume).  

3. Phase Changes: Transitions between states—such as melting, freezing, boiling, and condensation—are physical changes.  

4. Atoms: The basic building blocks of matter; smallest unit that retains an element’s properties.  

5. Subatomic Particles: Protons (positive), neutrons (neutral), and electrons (negative).  

6. Atomic Nucleus: Center of the atom, containing protons and neutrons.  

7. Electron Cloud: Region outside the nucleus where electrons move rapidly.

88. Deposition: Gas converts directly to solid (e.g., frost formation).  

89. Chemical Symbols & Equations: Universal “language” of chemistry for communication worldwide.  

90. Qualitative vs. Quantitative Observations: Qualitative describes non-numerical traits; quantitative involves measurements.  

91. Accuracy & Precision: Accuracy is closeness to true value; precision is repeatability or consistency.  

92. Lab Safety: Goggles, aprons, proper handling of chemicals and equipment, and knowledge of hazard symbols are essential.
