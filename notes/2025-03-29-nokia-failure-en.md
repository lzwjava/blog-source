Nokia's failure in the smartphone market after dominating the mobile phone industry for years can be attributed to several key factors:

1. Missing the smartphone revolution - Nokia was slow to recognize the shift toward touchscreen smartphones after Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. They clung to their physical keyboard designs and Symbian operating system too long.

2. Poor software strategy - While Nokia excelled at hardware, their Symbian operating system became outdated compared to iOS and Android. Their interface was less intuitive and they struggled to attract app developers.

3. Organizational resistance to change - Nokia had a strong engineering culture that was resistant to pivoting quickly. Former CEO Stephen Elop described it as a "burning platform" in a famous internal memo, highlighting the company's inability to adapt.

4. Failed Microsoft partnership - Nokia's 2011 decision to exclusively adopt Windows Phone instead of Android proved costly. Windows Phone never gained significant market share, leaving Nokia tied to a failing platform.

5. Internal politics and bureaucracy - Decision-making became slow and cumbersome as the company grew, preventing Nokia from responding quickly to market changes.

By the time Nokia fully embraced the smartphone era, competitors like Apple and Samsung had established dominant positions. Microsoft eventually acquired Nokia's mobile phone business in 2014, and later sold it to HMD Global, which now produces Nokia-branded phones.
