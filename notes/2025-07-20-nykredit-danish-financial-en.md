Nykredit is a major Danish financial services group, primarily known as one of the country's leading mortgage lenders (realkreditinstitut). Founded in 1985 through a merger of older credit associations, it operates as a member-owned entity (foreningsejet) and provides a wide range of services, including:

- **Mortgage lending**: Holding about 45% of Denmark's mortgage market, often through partnerships like Totalkredit.
- **Banking**: Via Nykredit Bank, offering retail banking, investment services, wealth management, and everyday financial products like savings accounts, loans, and online banking.
- **Other services**: Insurance, leasing, securities trading, asset management, and real estate brokerage.

The group serves both private individuals and businesses across Denmark, with a network of branches and partnerships (e.g., with Spar Nord Bank). It's headquartered in Copenhagen and emphasizes customer-owned stability. As of recent reports, it's performing strongly, with record quarterly results in early 2024 and a focus on sustainable financing.
