### Opening a Bank of China (Hong Kong) Account as a Mainland Chinese Citizen

As a Mainland Chinese citizen with a valid Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao (EEP, also known as the "endorsement"), you can open a BOC HK account while physically in Hong Kong. This is possible either via the BOCHK Mobile App (remote, app-based) or in-person at a branch. The mobile option is convenient if you meet the eligibility criteria and have a compatible device. Both methods comply with Hong Kong's regulatory requirements for customer due diligence (CDD).

Key notes:
- You must be at least 18 years old.
- You need to be a new customer (no existing BOC HK savings or current account).
- Accounts typically include an HKD Savings Account, Multi-Currency Savings Account, debit card (BOC Card), and access to mobile/internet banking.
- Initial transaction limits apply (e.g., HKD 10,000 daily for transfers); these increase after review.
- No monthly fees for basic integrated services, but other fees may apply for specific transactions.
- For investment or securities accounts, you must visit a branch in person.

#### Option 1: Mobile Account Opening (Recommended if Eligible)
This is available for Mainland visitors in Hong Kong and can be completed in about 10-15 minutes during service hours (Mon-Sat 9am-8pm, excluding holidays). If applied outside hours, processing happens the next working day.

**Eligibility Check:**
- Valid People's Republic of China Resident Identity Card (PRCID) and EEP (both valid for at least 30 days from application date).
- Valid exit-entry record from the National Immigration Administration (issued within 7 days of application).
- Mainland China mobile number, residential/correspondence addresses in Mainland China, valid email, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
- Device: iOS 13+ or Android 8+ with front/back camera and gravity sensor.

**Required Documents/Info:**
- Photos of both sides of your PRCID and EEP (clear, no glare/damage).
- Mainland mobile for SMS OTP verification.
- Personal details: Nationality (Mainland China), addresses, email, TIN (and jurisdiction of residence if outside HK).

**Steps:**
1. Download the BOCHK Mobile App from the App Store or Google Play.
2. Open the app, select "Account Opening," and enter your personal info (name, nationality, addresses, mobile, email, TIN, occupation, expected transactions/purpose).
3. Create usernames/passwords for internet banking and ATM.
4. Take clear photos of both sides of your PRCID and EEP.
5. Complete liveness verification: Take a selfie and follow prompts (e.g., blink eyes) for AI identity check.
6. Enter the OTP sent to your Mainland mobile.
7. Submit the application. You'll get an SMS/email confirmation if approved (immediate during hours).
8. Deposit initial funds via branch, ATM, or FPS to activate. Your BOC Card will be mailed to your Mainland address (arrives in 4 working days; activate via app).

If rejected or incomplete, visit a branch to complete.

#### Option 2: In-Person at a Branch
This is straightforward if you prefer face-to-face or don't qualify for mobile. No appointment needed, but check branch hours (generally Mon-Fri 9am-5pm, Sat 9am-1pm).

**Required Documents:**
- Original PRCID (photo-bearing) and valid EEP.
- For securities/investments: Address proof (e.g., recent bank statement or utility bill in your name, last 3 months).
- May need additional info: Employment details, income, account purpose, expected transactions, source of funds/wealth, family background (for private banking).

**Steps:**
1. Visit any BOC HK branch (find locations via app or website: over 60 branches island-wide).
2. Inform staff you want to open a personal account as a Mainland visitor.
3. Submit originals for verification and fill out forms.
4. Undergo CDD (may take 15-30 minutes; provide any extra info requested).
5. Get approval on-site or notification soon after. Deposit to activate.
6. For queries: Call hotline (852) 3988 2388.

**Tips:**
- Arrive early to avoid queues; bring all docs in original form.
- If planning frequent cross-border use, mention it—BOC HK integrates well with Mainland BOC services.
- Update any info changes promptly via app or branch.
- Tourist visas/EEPs allow this, but ensure your EEP covers your stay.
