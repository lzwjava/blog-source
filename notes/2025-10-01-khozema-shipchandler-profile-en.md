Khozema Shipchandler is the 51-year-old Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Twilio Inc., a leading cloud communications platform valued at approximately $16 billion, known for its APIs that enable businesses to integrate SMS, voice, email, and other messaging services into their applications.[1][2][3][4]

## Early Life and Education
Shipchandler was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA, to parents of Indian origin who immigrated from Mumbai.[5][6] He grew up in the United States and attended Indiana University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology and English, with a minor in Business[6].

## Career Background
Shipchandler has over 25 years of experience in finance, operations, and business development.[4] He began his professional journey in corporate roles, eventually rising to senior positions at General Electric (GE) subsidiaries, including serving as CFO and then Chief Commercial Officer for GE Digital[7][8]. In these capacities, he drove global operational excellence, financial planning, and business development across regions like the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey[7][9][4]. He also has experience in information technology and building $16 billion enterprises through disciplined strategies.

He joined Twilio in a financial leadership role, initially serving as CFO, and was later appointed President of Twilio Communications, where he focused on enhancing efficiency, innovation, and streamlined experiences for businesses worldwide[7][4][10]. In January 2024, Shipchandler was promoted to CEO, overseeing Twilio's customer engagement platform that delivers real-time, personalized experiences[4].

## Leadership Style and Public Profile
Shipchandler is known for his intense work ethic and disciplined routine, which he credits for his success. He wakes at 4:30 a.m., works Sundays, and incorporates short running breaks around his house during the day to manage stress, emphasizing that true balance comes from sacrifice rather than dividing time equally between work and life[1][2][5][11][12][13][14]. This approach has drawn attention in discussions around work-life balance for Gen Z, with Shipchandler arguing that demanding schedules are essential for building enduring careers and companies[14]. He resides in the San Francisco Bay Area and leverages his Indian-American background to relate to diverse teams[5].
