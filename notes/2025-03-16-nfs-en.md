title: Setting Up an NFS Server for Media Sharing on Ubuntu
translated: false
---

To set up an NFS (Network File System) server on Ubuntu to serve media files, follow these detailed steps. This guide assumes you want to share a directory containing media files (e.g., videos, music) over your network securely and efficiently.

---

### Step 1: Install the NFS Server Software
First, you need to install the NFS server package on your Ubuntu system.

1. Update the package list to ensure you get the latest versions:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Install the `nfs-kernel-server` package, which provides the NFS server functionality:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
   ```

This installs the necessary software to run an NFS server.

---

### Step 2: Create and Configure the Media Directory
You need a directory to store your media files and configure it for sharing.

1. Create a directory to hold your media files (e.g., `/media/share`):
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /media/share
   ```

2. Set the ownership to your user account (replace `$USER` with your actual username if needed):
   ```bash
   sudo chown $USER:$USER /media/share
   ```

3. Adjust permissions to allow access. For media files that are primarily read-only for clients, you can set:
   - Directories: `755` (read and execute for others)
   - Files: `644` (read for others)
   However, for simplicity, apply `755` recursively if you don’t need fine-grained control:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 755 /media/share
   ```
   - **Note**: Media files don’t need to be executable, but `755` on files won’t harm NFS functionality since execution happens locally on the client.

4. Place your media files in `/media/share` (e.g., copy videos or music into this directory).

---

### Step 3: Configure NFS Exports
The NFS server uses the `/etc/exports` file to define which directories to share and who can access them.

1. Open the exports file with a text editor:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/exports
   ```

2. Add a line to share `/media/share`. The syntax is:
   ```
   /path/to/directory client(options)
   ```
   - **Example 1**: Share with a specific client IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) with read-write access:
     ```
     /media/share 192.168.1.100(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
     ```
   - **Example 2**: Share with all devices on your subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`) with read-only access:
     ```
     /media/share 192.168.1.0/24(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
     ```
   - **Example 3**: Share with any device (less secure, use cautiously):
     ```
     /media/share *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
     ```

   **Options Explained**:
   - `rw`: Read-write access (use `ro` for read-only if preferred for media streaming).
   - `sync`: Ensures data is written to disk before confirming operations (safer but slower; use `async` for performance at the risk of data loss in crashes).
   - `no_subtree_check`: Improves performance by disabling subtree checking (recommended for most setups).

3. Save the file (`Ctrl+O`, then `Enter` in nano) and exit (`Ctrl+X`).

---

### Step 4: Apply the NFS Configuration
After editing the exports file, update the NFS server to reflect your changes.

1. Export the shares:
   ```bash
   sudo exportfs -a
   ```

2. Restart the NFS server to apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
   ```

3. Verify the service is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status nfs-kernel-server
   ```
   - Look for "active (running)" in the output.

4. Check the exported directories:
   ```bash
   sudo exportfs -v
   ```
   - This should list `/media/share` with the options you specified.

---

### Step 5: Configure the Firewall
NFS uses specific ports, and you need to ensure your firewall allows traffic to them. Ubuntu often uses UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall).

1. **Default NFS Ports**:
   - NFS: 2049 (TCP/UDP)
   - RPC: 111 (TCP/UDP)
   - Other services (mountd, statd, lockd): Dynamic by default, but can be set to static ports.

2. For simplicity, allow the essential ports with dynamic settings (if you don’t set static ports):
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 2049
   sudo ufw allow 111
   ```
   - **Note**: This may not cover all NFS traffic if mountd, statd, or lockd use random ports.

3. **Optional: Set Static Ports for Better Control** (recommended for precise firewall rules):
   - Edit `/etc/default/nfs-kernel-server`:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/default/nfs-kernel-server
     ```
     Add or modify:
     ```
     RPCMOUNTDOPTS="-p 4001"
     ```
   - Edit `/etc/default/nfs-common`:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/default/nfs-common
     ```
     Add or modify:
     ```
     STATDOPTS="-p 4002"
     ```
   - Create `/etc/modprobe.d/nfs.conf` for lockd:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/nfs.conf
     ```
     Add:
     ```
     options lockd nlm_udp_port=4003 nlm_tcp_port=4003
     ```
   - Restart the NFS server:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
     ```

4. Allow the static ports in UFW:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 2049/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 2049/udp
   sudo ufw allow 111/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 111/udp
   sudo ufw allow 4001/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 4001/udp
   sudo ufw allow 4002/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 4002/udp
   sudo ufw allow 4003/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 4003/udp
   ```

5. Enable UFW if it’s not already active:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

---

### Step 6: Verify the Setup
Ensure the NFS server is working correctly.

1. Check exported shares from the server:
   ```bash
   showmount -e localhost
   ```
   - You should see `/media/share` listed with the correct clients/options.

2. Verify listening ports:
   ```bash
   sudo ss -tuln | grep -E "2049|111|4001|4002|4003"
   ```
   - Confirm these ports are open and bound to the NFS services.

---

### Step 7: Test from a Client (Optional)
On a client machine (e.g., another Ubuntu system), test mounting the share:
```bash
sudo mount -t nfs <server_ip>:/media/share /mnt
```
- Replace `<server_ip>` with your NFS server’s IP address.
- Ensure `/mnt` exists (`sudo mkdir /mnt` if needed).
- Access `/mnt` to verify you can see and play the media files.

---

### Additional Notes for Media Files
- **Read-Only Access**: If clients only need to stream media, use `ro` in `/etc/exports` to prevent modifications.
- **Permissions**: Ensure media files are readable by clients. UID/GID mismatches between server and client can cause access issues; adjust file permissions or use NFS options like `all_squash` if needed (advanced).
- **Performance**: For large media files, the default `sync` option is safe but slower. Test with `async` if performance is a priority and data loss risk is acceptable.
- **NFS Version**: Ubuntu defaults to NFSv4, which is suitable for media serving. No additional configuration is typically needed unless supporting older clients (NFSv3).

---

### Summary of Commands
Here’s a quick reference for the basic setup (without static ports):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
sudo mkdir -p /media/share
sudo chown $USER:$USER /media/share
sudo chmod -R 755 /media/share
echo "/media/share *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)" | sudo tee -a /etc/exports
sudo exportfs -a
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
sudo ufw allow 2049
sudo ufw allow 111
```

With this setup, your Ubuntu NFS server should be ready to serve media files over the network. Adjust IP addresses, permissions, and firewall rules based on your security and network requirements.
