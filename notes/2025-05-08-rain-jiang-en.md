Their achievements highlight not only technical prowess but also dedication to the field of competitive programming, making them a standout figure in the community.

### Competitive Programming Career
Rain Jiang’s competitive programming journey is marked by consistent excellence at the IOI, where they represented the United States from 2021 to 2024. Their performance, as detailed in the provided data, showcases a trajectory of growth and dominance:

- **2024 (IOI, Alexandria, Egypt)**: Jiang achieved a gold medal, ranking 5th out of 353 participants (98.87% relative rank) with a score of 434.40/600 (72.40%). This performance solidified their status as one of the top young programmers globally, competing against an elite international field.[](https://usaco.org/)
- **2023 (IOI, Szeged, Hungary)**: Jiang again secured a gold medal, ranking 5th out of 350 participants (98.86% relative rank) with a score of 447.5/600 (74.58%). Their consistent top-5 placement underscored their ability to perform under pressure and solve complex problems efficiently.
- **2022 (IOI, Yogyakarta and Online, Indonesia)**: Jiang earned a silver medal, placing 36th out of 349 participants (89.97% relative rank) with a score of 392.10/600 (65.35%). While not as high as their later performances, this result was still impressive, reflecting their growing expertise.
- **2021 (IOI, Online)**: Jiang won a gold medal, ranking 5th out of 351 participants (98.86% relative rank) with an outstanding score of 479/600 (79.83%). This marked their emergence as a top-tier competitor early in their career.

Jiang’s IOI record includes three gold medals (2021, 2023, 2024) and one silver medal (2022), with top-5 global rankings in three out of four years. Their ability to maintain high scores across diverse problem sets demonstrates versatility in tackling algorithmic challenges, including data structures, graph theory, dynamic programming, and combinatorics.

### Involvement with USACO
Jiang’s success at the IOI is closely tied to their participation in the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO), a national program that identifies and trains top high school students in competitive programming. As a USACO finalist, Jiang was invited to the organization’s training camp, where they competed for a spot on the U.S. team for the IOI. Their selection for four consecutive years (2021–2024) reflects their dominance in national competitions and rigorous preparation through USACO’s structured contests, which progress from Bronze to Platinum divisions.[](https://usaco.org/)

USACO’s announcement of the 2024 IOI results highlighted Jiang’s gold medal and 5th-place finish, underscoring their contribution to the U.S. team’s strong performance. Their involvement in USACO likely provided access to advanced training resources and mentorship, which were instrumental in honing their skills.

### Broader Context and Achievements
Beyond the IOI, Jiang has been active in other competitive programming platforms, with a record of 26 competitions as of their last activity on February 21, 2025, according to CLIST. Their consistent participation in high-level contests suggests a deep commitment to the field, likely including events like the USACO monthly contests, Codeforces rounds, or other regional and international tournaments.[](https://clist.by/account/Rain%2520Jiang%2C%2520USA/resource/usaco.org/)

Jiang is also a graduate student at the University of Minnesota, where they have served as a teaching assistant in the Department of Psychology, earning a Teaching Assistant Award in Fall 2021. This indicates a well-rounded profile, balancing academic pursuits with competitive programming and teaching responsibilities. Their academic background likely complements their problem-solving skills, fostering a disciplined and analytical approach to both research and competitions.[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rain-jiang-024b68204/)
