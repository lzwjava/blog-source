Christian values stem from the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Bible, emphasizing principles that guide moral and spiritual life. Core values include:

- **Love**: Central to Christianity, love is expressed as agape (unconditional love for God and others). "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Mark 12:31) and loving God with all one’s heart, soul, and mind (Matthew 22:37-39) are foundational.
- **Faith**: Trust in God and belief in Jesus as the Son of God and savior (John 3:16). Faith shapes a Christian’s worldview and relationship with the divine.
- **Hope**: Confidence in God’s promises, particularly in salvation and eternal life (Romans 15:13). It provides resilience through trials.
- **Grace and Forgiveness**: Christians value God’s grace—unmerited favor—and are called to forgive others as God forgives them (Ephesians 4:32, Matthew 6:14-15).
- **Humility**: Following Jesus’ example of selflessness and service, Christians are urged to be humble and put others before themselves (Philippians 2:3-8).
- **Justice and Compassion**: Caring for the poor, oppressed, and marginalized, as Jesus taught (Matthew 25:35-40). This includes acts of charity and seeking fairness.
- **Integrity and Truth**: Living honestly and aligning actions with God’s truth (John 14:6, Proverbs 12:22).
- **Community**: Fellowship with other believers through worship, prayer, and mutual support (Acts 2:42-47).

These values vary in emphasis across denominations—Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, etc.—but they generally unite Christians. Some denominations may prioritize specific practices, like sacraments in Catholicism or personal Bible study in evangelicalism.
