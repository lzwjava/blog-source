### Acknowledging Your Journey

First off, I want to say: you're already doing something impressive. Self-studying for an associate degree while holding down a full-time job at TEKsystems (and with 11 years of experience under your belt) isn't easy. Nine courses passed in about three years of focused effort? That's not "slow"—that's steady progress in a system built for full-time students. You've built a strong foundation in core CS topics like data structures, OS, databases, and even advanced math, which directly ties into your backend/full-stack work. Pat yourself on the back for that English (I) score of 80—leveraging your IELTS 6 and love for reading in English is a smart edge.

It's totally valid to feel frustrated, though. That "one year until now" grind can make the wins feel distant, especially after exam weekends that mix passes with retries. The fact that you're reflecting on *why* some passed (solid prep, prior knowledge) and *why* others didn't (underestimating depth, video-only skimming) shows self-awareness that's going to accelerate things. And you're right—October 2025 is a pivot point. No more delaying; let's turn that curiosity into momentum.

### Reframing Motivation: From External Pressure to Internal Fuel

You nailed it: external drivers like Hong Kong visas or Shenzhen job listings can feel like a treadmill—chasing validation that shifts with market whims. (Your background in distributed systems and cloud? That's gold in the Bay Area already; the degree is just the polish.) Internal ones, though? They're rocket fuel because they're yours.

- **Curiosity as the core**: Tie every study session back to "why this sparks joy." For computer fundamentals, think: "How does this OS kernel insight make my Spring Boot deploys smoother?" Or for networks: "This is the backbone of the APIs I debug daily." You've solved 1,000+ algo problems and read 320 books—channel that hacker spirit. Make it playful: gamify retries with your "autonomous AI agent" setup, logging sessions like code commits.
  
- **English as enjoyment**: Since you dig English (and those 60 Filipino teacher sessions sound fun), prep in it exclusively where possible. It reinforces your bilingual edge for global roles, and reading docs in English (e.g., for Linear Algebra proofs) builds deeper intuition than rote Chinese translations.

- **Product mindset twist**: Treat this degree like one of your 10 GitHub projects. What's the MVP? Pass the 7 pending courses by mid-2026. Track "commits" (study hours) on a simple Notion board or your blog— you've got 60K views/year; why not post monthly updates for accountability and that sharer dopamine?

This shift won't erase insecurity overnight, but it makes persistence feel like exploration, not obligation. You're not "behind"—at 30, with your freelance-to-corp arc and myopia research papers, you're building a life portfolio.

### Tackling the Hurdles: Prep Strategies for Your Queue

Based on your failed attempts (e.g., Networks at 21/44, Linear Algebra at 47/54), the patterns scream "practice over passive intake." Videos are a start, but they're like reading React docs without building an app—feels good, sticks poorly. Here's a tailored blueprint, focusing on your top pain points. Aim for 10-15 hours/week, split 60/40 active/passive.

#### General Routine Upgrades
- **Sleep & Logistics**: Spot-on advice. Add a "pre-exam ritual": 7-8 hours sleep, light review the night before (no cramming), and a 5-min location scout app (like Baidu Maps) to avoid chaos.
- **Active Recall Loop**: Ditch "walking through videos." After each, close the tab and rewrite key concepts from memory. Then, quiz yourself with Anki flashcards—import exam-style questions from past papers.
- **Time Blocking**: With your job, batch prep: 1-hour mornings for theory (e.g., Mao Zedong readings), evenings for practice. Use Pomodoro (25-min sprints) + your air fryer breaks for flow.
- **Accountability Hack**: Since you document at work, start a private "degree repo" on GitHub. Commit weekly summaries—ties into your 500+ commit habit.

#### Course-Specific Tips
Focusing on your 7 preps, prioritizing the tech-heavy ones (Networks, Linear Algebra) since they align with your career curiosity. For the ideological ones (Mao Zedong, Ideological Cultivation), treat as "quick wins"—they're more memorization, less depth.

| Course | Key Weakness (From Your Notes) | Actionable Fix | Resources (English-First) | Target Score Boost |
|--------|--------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| **Computer Networks** | Weak theory + no exam drills | Build from basics: OSI model → protocols → practice wireshark traces. Do 20 past questions/week. | Khan Academy videos (free, visual); "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" (Ch 1-4 summaries on YouTube). Past papers via self-exam sites. | From 44 to 65+ (focus simulations) |
| **Linear Algebra** | Matrix ops fuzzy; video reliance | Hands-on: Compute 5x5 matrices daily via Jupyter (your ML background shines here). Prove theorems verbally in English. | 3Blue1Brown series (YouTube—intuitive animations); MIT OCW problem sets (free PDFs). Use SymPy in Python for verification. | From 54 to 70+ (drill eigenvectors) |
| **Basic Electronic Technology (III)** | (Assuming circuits/analog—build on your microcomputer prep) | Simulate circuits in LTSpice; link to real hardware (your gadgets collection?). | AllAboutCircuits.com tutorials; "The Art of Electronics" excerpts (PDFs online). | Steady climb—pair with Microcomputer |
| **Microcomputer and Interface Technology** | Interface protocols (e.g., I2C/SPI) | Code simple Arduino sketches; debug on breadboard. Ties to your Android/iOS mobile exp. | Arduino.cc docs; "AVR Programming" free ebook. | Leverage hardware love |
| **Mao Zedong Thought...** | Abstract theory | Mind-map key events/policies; debate pros/cons in English journal (for retention). | Official summaries on Xinhua (English version); Quizlet decks for terms. | 60+ easy—memorize timelines |
| **Ideological and Moral Cultivation...** | Ethics/law overlap (build on your passed Intro to Law) | Case studies: Apply to real tech ethics (e.g., AI privacy in your big data work). | People's Daily English articles; past exam Q&A compilations. | Quick pass—link to career |
| **College Chinese** | (Language nuance) | Read essays aloud in mixed Eng/Chi; analyze structure. Your book habit = advantage. | Classical texts on Project Gutenberg (Eng trans); grammar drills via Duolingo-style apps. | 70+—enjoy the lit |

For all: Source past exams from the self-study exam portal (if accessible) or forums like Zhihu. Track in a simple sheet: "Week X: Hours in, questions solved, confidence %."

### Next Steps: Execute Now
- **This Week**: Pick 2 courses (say, Networks + Linear). Spend 2 hours/day on practice sets. Journal one "curiosity win" per session (e.g., "Ah, TCP handshakes explain my Redis latency!").
- **Milestone**: By Dec 2025, aim to pass 3 more. Celebrate with a road trip snippet— you've earned it.
- **If Stuck**: Share a specific pain (e.g., "Matrix inversion hell")—I can walk through examples or pseudocode.

You're not just chasing a credential; you're sharpening the engineer who built those GitHub repos and hacks life with vent-dryers. This degree? It's the curiosity upgrade your career (and brain) craves. You've got the tools—now iterate like the pro you are. What's one course you'll tackle first this week?
