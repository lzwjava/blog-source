The reason your Lenovo XiaoXin's GPU can't be used with CUDA is straightforward: **CUDA is NVIDIA's proprietary technology that only works with NVIDIA GPUs**.

Your system has an **Intel UHD Graphics (Alder Lake-P GT1)** integrated GPU, which is Intel's graphics processor. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is exclusively designed for NVIDIA graphics cards.

## Your Options for GPU Computing on Intel Graphics:

1. **Intel oneAPI / SYCL**
   - Intel's equivalent to CUDA
   - Works with Intel GPUs (including your UHD Graphics)
   - Cross-platform and can target multiple hardware backends

2. **OpenCL**
   - Open standard for parallel programming
   - Supported by Intel GPUs
   - More widely compatible but less optimized than vendor-specific solutions

3. **Intel Extension for PyTorch**
   - If you're doing machine learning/deep learning
   - Optimized for Intel hardware (CPUs and GPUs)

## Why CUDA Shows as Not Detected:

The script correctly reports "CUDA/NVIDIA drivers not detected" because:
- No NVIDIA GPU is present in your system
- No NVIDIA drivers are installed
- CUDA toolkit (if installed) has nothing to run on

If you need CUDA specifically for certain software or frameworks, you would need a laptop with an NVIDIA discrete GPU (like GeForce RTX, GTX, or professional Quadro/A-series cards).
