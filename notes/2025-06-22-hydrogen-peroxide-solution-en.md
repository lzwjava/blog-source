To calculate the final concentration of hydrogen peroxide after diluting 300 mL of 7.5% hydrogen peroxide with 300 mL of water, we can use the dilution formula:

**C₁V₁ = C₂V₂**

Where:
- **C₁** = initial concentration (7.5% or 0.075)
- **V₁** = initial volume (300 mL)
- **C₂** = final concentration (what we want to find)
- **V₂** = final volume (300 mL + 300 mL = 600 mL)

Rearranging for **C₂**:
**C₂ = (C₁V₁) / V₂**

Substitute the values:
**C₂ = (7.5% × 300 mL) / 600 mL = (0.075 × 300) / 600 = 0.0375 or 3.75%**

So, the final concentration of hydrogen peroxide is **3.75%**.

### Stirring the Solution
Yes, you should stir the solution to ensure the hydrogen peroxide and water mix thoroughly. Stirring helps achieve a uniform concentration faster. You can use a clean spoon, stir stick, or any non-reactive utensil. Gentle swirling or stirring for a few seconds is usually sufficient, as hydrogen peroxide mixes readily with water. Avoid vigorous shaking if the container is sealed, as hydrogen peroxide can release oxygen gas, potentially causing pressure buildup.

A 3% hydrogen peroxide solution in a 500ml bottle, left open and undisturbed, will lose its effectiveness over time due to decomposition, but the rate depends on several factors. Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) naturally breaks down into water and oxygen, especially when exposed to air, light, heat, or contaminants. Here's a breakdown:

- **Exposure to Air**: With the lid open, oxygen is released more readily, accelerating decomposition. The open bottle allows the hydrogen peroxide to interact with air, which can introduce contaminants or catalysts (like dust or microbes) that speed up the breakdown.
- **Timeframe**: At 3% concentration, hydrogen peroxide is relatively stable compared to higher concentrations, but an open bottle could lose significant potency within days to weeks. Studies suggest that even in sealed conditions, 3% hydrogen peroxide can lose about 1-2% of its strength per year at room temperature. An open bottle will degrade faster—potentially losing effectiveness within a few days if exposed to air and light.
- **Conditions**: If the bottle is left in a cool, dark place, decomposition will be slower than if it’s exposed to sunlight or heat. Light, especially UV, and higher temperatures catalyze the breakdown.

**Practical Impact**: 
- For uses like disinfection or wound cleaning, the solution may still be somewhat effective for a short period (e.g., a day or two) if uncontaminated, but potency will decrease steadily. After a week or more, it may be too weak for reliable use.
- To preserve effectiveness, store hydrogen peroxide in a sealed, opaque container in a cool, dark place.

**Recommendation**: Close the lid tightly after use and store it properly to maintain its efficacy. If it’s been open for an extended period (e.g., days), consider testing it (e.g., by checking if it fizzes on contact with organic material) or replacing it for critical applications like disinfection.

If you need more specific data (e.g., exact decomposition rates under certain conditions), I can search for additional studies or calculations. Let me know!

Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) kills bacteria by acting as a strong oxidizing agent, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage bacterial cell components like proteins, DNA, and membranes. When it interacts with bacteria, enzymes like catalase (present in many bacteria) break it down into water (H₂O) and oxygen (O₂). This decomposition can reduce its effectiveness over time, as the hydrogen peroxide is consumed.

Yes, it partially becomes oxygen (O₂) and water after reacting. The reaction is:

2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂

This means once it kills bacteria or reacts with organic material, it loses its antimicrobial potency, as it’s converted into harmless water and oxygen. The rate of this loss depends on factors like concentration, bacterial enzyme activity, and environmental conditions.
