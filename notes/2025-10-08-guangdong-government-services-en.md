The Guangdong Public Service Platform (commonly known as the Guangdong Government Services Network or "广东政务服务网") is an official online and offline integrated system for provincial administrative services, including those accessible to Guangzhou citizens. It supports "one-stop" handling of government matters across Guangdong's cities, with many services available via app (like "Yue Sheng Shi" mini-program), website, self-service kiosks, and mobile terminals. For Guangzhou residents, it's a key hub for everyday administrative tasks, and it integrates with self-service machines (e.g., at exit-entry service halls) for checking application receipts, status updates, or results—like for HK/Macau travel endorsements.

### Key Services Related to HK/Macau Endorsements
These are handled under the "Passport and Travel Permits" category, often via online appointment and self-service verification:
- Issuance, renewal, or replacement of the Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao (港澳通行证).
- Adding endorsements (签注) for tourism, business, visiting relatives, or multiple entries to HK/Macau.
- Status checks and receipt verification at self-service kiosks, which link directly to the platform for real-time updates.

Guangzhou citizens can book appointments online, upload photos/documents, and collect permits at local police stations or service centers. Processing typically takes 7-10 working days, with options for expedited service.

### Other Typical Services for Guangzhou Citizens
The platform covers over 3,000 service items across major categories, with high-frequency ones "one-network" accessible province-wide (including cross-city handling). Here's a breakdown of main categories with examples relevant to daily life in Guangzhou:

| Category | Examples of Services |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Personal Documents & Travel** | ID card issuance/renewal; household registration changes; passport applications; HK/Macau/Taiwan travel permits (as above); residence permits for foreigners. |
| **Employment & Social Security** | Unemployment registration; job matching via public recruitment; social insurance queries/payments; maternity/medical benefits claims; flexible employment subsidies. |
| **Health & Medical Insurance** | Medical insurance enrollment/renewal; cross-province settlement for treatments; health code issuance; vaccination records. |
| **Education & Family** | Student enrollment; birth registration; marriage/divorce filing; family planning certificates. |
| **Housing & Utilities** | Housing provident fund deposits/withdrawals; rental contracts registration; water/electricity/gas bill payments; property ownership transfers. |
| **Driving & Vehicles** | Driver's license exams/renewals; vehicle registration/inspections; traffic violation handling. |
| **Business & Enterprise** | Company registration; business licenses; tax filings; seal engraving for firms. |
| **Taxes & Payments** | Personal income tax declarations; invoice queries; unified public service payments (e.g., fines, fees). |
| **Other Civic Services** | Pension applications; legal aid requests; environmental complaints; cultural venue bookings. |

Most services allow online applications with electronic signatures, reducing in-person visits. Guangzhou-specific integrations include links to local halls like the Zhongshan Government Service Center for cross-boundary services. For receipts or status (e.g., endorsements), scan a QR code at kiosks to log in via WeChat/Alipay and view digitally.
