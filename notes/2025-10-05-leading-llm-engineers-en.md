### Top 10 AI Experts/Engineers in the LLM Era

The LLM era, roughly spanning the last decade since the Transformer architecture's introduction in 2017, has been shaped by pioneers who advanced model scaling, training techniques, safety, and applications. This list focuses on those with deep technical understanding and outsized impact on major systems like ChatGPT (OpenAI), Grok (xAI), Gemini (Google DeepMind), and Claude (Anthropic). I've prioritized researchers and engineers directly involved in breakthroughs, drawing from their contributions to foundational papers, model development, and open-source tools.

1. **Ilya Sutskever**  
   Co-founder and former Chief Scientist at OpenAI; led the development of GPT series models, including the core innovations behind ChatGPT's generative capabilities. His work on sequence transduction and scaling laws has defined LLM training paradigms.

2. **Dario Amodei**  
   CEO and co-founder of Anthropic (creators of Claude); previously VP of Research at OpenAI. Pioneered scalable oversight and constitutional AI techniques, ensuring safer, more aligned LLMs with massive impact on ethical deployment.

3. **Andrej Karpathy**  
   Former Director of AI at OpenAI and Tesla; key architect of GPT-2/3 interfaces and vision-language models. His educational resources and fine-tuning methods have democratized LLM engineering for millions.

4. **Jeff Dean**  
   Chief Scientist at Google DeepMind; oversaw the infrastructure for training massive models like PaLM and Gemini. Revolutionized distributed systems for LLMs, enabling trillion-parameter scales.

5. **Demis Hassabis**  
   CEO of Google DeepMind; drove integration of DeepMind's reinforcement learning into Gemini's multimodal capabilities. His neuroscience-inspired approaches have influenced episodic memory in LLMs.

6. **Aidan Gomez**  
   Co-creator of the Transformer architecture (Attention Is All You Need paper); co-founder of Cohere. Directly shaped the blueprint for all modern LLMs, from GPT to Gemini.

7. **Jason Wei**  
   Research Scientist at OpenAI; invented chain-of-thought prompting and instruction tuning, which unlocked ChatGPT's reasoning prowess and boosted performance across benchmarks.

8. **Yoshua Bengio**  
   Turing Award winner and professor at Université de Montréal; advanced generative models and AI safety frameworks adopted in Claude and Grok. His warnings on LLM risks have guided industry ethics.

9. **Jimmy Ba**  
   Co-founder and Head of AI at xAI (Grok); former student of Geoffrey Hinton. Specializes in optimization for large models, contributing to Grok's efficient training on massive clusters.

10. **Tom Brown**  
    Research Scientist at Anthropic; lead author on GPT-3 paper and key developer of Claude's core architecture. His scaling experiments demonstrated LLMs' emergent abilities, influencing the entire field.

These individuals stand out for their hands-on technical depth—authoring pivotal papers, leading model releases, and tackling real-world deployment challenges—while driving the explosive growth of LLMs over the past 10 years.
