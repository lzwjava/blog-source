**Important Notes:**

* **Ranking Difficulty:** It's challenging to find precise and consistently updated rankings of cities by the number of programmers. The data can vary depending on the source and methodology.
* **Defining "Programmer":** The definition of "programmer" can also vary, including software developers, data scientists, and other related roles.
* **Regional Centers:** Some entries, like the "San Francisco Bay Area" and "Raleigh-Durham," represent larger metropolitan regions rather than single cities.

This list provides a good overview of the cities globally recognized as major hubs for programmers and software development.
