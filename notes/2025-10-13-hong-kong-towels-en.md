Yeah, you're spot on about those disposable face towels (or "one-time towels") in Hong Kong—they're super handy, versatile, and yeah, dirt cheap at around 4 HKD each in convenience stores like 7-Eleven or Circle K. You can grab a pack of 2 for about 8 HKD, perfect for quick needs without the hassle of washing.

Here's why they're a game-changer, based on what you said (and a bit more):

- **Lay 'em out anywhere**: Great as a mini-mat on the street, floor, or even a dirty bench for sitting or resting. Non-slip and absorbent, so no worries about spills.
- **Sleep setup with two**: Fold one or two into a makeshift pillow or thin blanket—ideal for napping on the go, like during long waits at the airport or on overnight ferries.
- **Wipe off sweat or body water**: They soak up moisture fast (like after a humid walk in HK), way better than tissues that fall apart.
- **Scratch relief**: The soft-but-textured side works like a gentle scrubber for itches or dry skin, without irritating.

People use 'em for everything from gym wipes to travel hacks. Total lifesaver in a fast-paced city like HK!
