To marinate chicken wings for maximum flavor, follow these steps:

1. **Choose Your Marinade**: Select a marinade based on the flavor profile you want. Here are a few simple options:
   - **Classic BBQ**: Mix ½ cup BBQ sauce, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp smoked paprika.
   - **Spicy Buffalo**: Combine ½ cup hot sauce (like Frank’s RedHot), ¼ cup melted butter, 1 tbsp honey, and 1 tsp garlic powder.
   - **Asian-Inspired**: Blend ¼ cup soy sauce, 2 tbsp sesame oil, 2 tbsp honey, 1 tbsp rice vinegar, 2 tsp minced ginger, and 2 minced garlic cloves.
   - **Herb & Lemon**: Mix ⅓ cup olive oil, juice of 1 lemon, 2 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp thyme, 2 minced garlic cloves, and salt/pepper to taste.

2. **Prepare the Wings**: Use 2–3 lbs of chicken wings (about 20–30 wings). Pat them dry with paper towels to help the marinade stick better. Place wings in a large resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish.

3. **Marinate**: Pour the marinade over the wings, ensuring they’re fully coated. If using a bag, seal it and massage the marinade into the wings. If using a dish, toss the wings and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least **30 minutes**, but ideally **2–6 hours** for deeper flavor. For best results, don’t exceed 24 hours to avoid the meat breaking down too much.

4. **Flip Occasionally**: If marinating for longer than 30 minutes, flip the bag or toss the wings every couple of hours to ensure even coating.

5. **Cook**: Remove wings from the marinade, letting excess drip off. Discard the marinade or boil it for 5 minutes if you want to use it as a sauce (never use raw marinade directly). Cook the wings by:
   - **Grilling**: Grill over medium heat (350–400°F) for 20–25 minutes, turning occasionally, until internal temperature reaches 165°F.
   - **Baking**: Bake at 400°F on a lined baking sheet for 35–45 minutes, flipping halfway, until crispy and cooked through.
   - **Frying**: Fry in 375°F oil for 8–10 minutes until golden and cooked to 165°F internally.

**Tips**:
- For crispier wings, let them air-dry in the fridge for 30 minutes after marinating, uncovered.
- Add 1 tsp of baking powder (not baking soda) to the marinade for extra crispy baked wings.
- Always check the internal temperature (165°F) to ensure they’re fully cooked.
