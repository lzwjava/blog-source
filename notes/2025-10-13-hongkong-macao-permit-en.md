Ah, got it—thanks for the correction! You're absolutely right. The permit for mainland Chinese citizens traveling to Hong Kong or Macao is officially known as the **Hong Kong and Macao Travel Permit** (in Chinese: **往来港澳通行证**). It's the standard document issued by mainland China's exit-entry authorities for personal visits, tourism, business, or other short-term trips to those regions.

To recap quickly (with the updated name):
- **Home Return Permit** (or **Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents**, **港澳居民来往内地通行证**): Specifically for Chinese nationals who are permanent residents of Hong Kong or Macao, allowing them to travel to and stay in mainland China.
- **Hong Kong and Macao Travel Permit**: For mainland Chinese citizens like yourself, enabling travel to Hong Kong and Macao. You apply for it at local public security bureaus, and it requires endorsements for each trip (e.g., for tourism or business).

If that's not quite what you meant or if you have more details on your travel plans, let me know!
