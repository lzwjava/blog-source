Your experience highlights several valuable lessons for handling future power outages, especially in hot weather. Here’s a structured breakdown of insights and actionable improvements:

---

### **Key Lessons Learned:**
1. **Proactive Response Over Reactive Frustration**
   - You waited ~50 minutes before acting (going to the car at 00:55), but the outage lasted only ~57 minutes (00:06–01:03). Next time, assume a **minimum 1-hour outage** (or longer if your area has frequent issues) and act earlier to avoid discomfort.
   - *Example*: If the AC cuts off at 00:06, move to the car by 00:15–00:20 to maximize cool air time.

2. **Signal and Communication Planning**
   - Low mobile signal in underground parking is a critical weakness. Preempt this by:
     - **Designating a meet-up spot** (e.g., outside the building entrance) where signal is strong.
     - **Using offline tools**: Walkie-talkies (if you have them) or pre-agreed text messages (e.g., "If power out >30 mins, meet at car").
     - **Power bank for Wi-Fi hotspot**: If your phone has weak signal but data works, a power bank can help send messages via apps (WhatsApp, etc.) even if calls fail.

3. **Observing Neighbors’ Behavior**
   - The two cars parked outside confirm that others use their vehicles as a backup cooling solution. This validates your approach—**you’re not overreacting**. Next time, join them sooner or even park near them (safety in numbers).

4. **Car as a Temporary Refuge**
   - Your car’s AC is a lifesaver, but optimize its use:
     - **Start the car immediately** when power fails (if safe to do so) to cool the interior faster.
     - **Idling vs. driving**: If parked, idle briefly to cool the car, then turn it off to conserve fuel (modern cars can idle 30+ mins on a full tank with minimal fuel use).
     - **Window shades/sun reflectors**: Keep these in your car to reduce heat buildup when parked.

5. **Power Outage Preparedness Kit**
   - Keep a small bag in your car or home with:
     - Portable fan (USB/battery-powered).
     - Cooling towel or spray bottle with water.
     - Snacks/water (heat exhausts you faster).
     - Flashlight/headlamp (if you need to navigate stairs in the dark).

6. **Emotional Management**
   - Frustration is natural, but reframe the outage as a **"planned break"**:
     - Use the time to listen to music/podcasts in the car.
     - Treat it like a mini "camping" experience (e.g., stargazing if outside).
     - Accept that some things are out of your control—focus on what you *can* do (e.g., cooling off in the car).

7. **Long-Term Solutions**
   - **Investigate backup power**:
     - A small **portable power station** (e.g., Jackery, EcoFlow) can run a fan or even a mini AC for hours.
     - If feasible, a **generator** (for essentials like fridge/AC) or **solar charger** for phones.
   - **Talk to building management**:
     - Ask about backup power for common areas or elevators.
     - Suggest a group chat for residents to share outage updates.

8. **Post-Outage Reflection**
   - After power returns, take 2 minutes to:
     - Note what worked (e.g., car AC was effective).
     - Note what didn’t (e.g., poor signal in parking).
     - Adjust your plan (e.g., "Next time, go to the car in 10 mins").

### **Your Proposed Solution (With Tweaks):**
> *"I should go to my car early as soon as possible, next time just expect this will need 1 hour to fix, so I can enjoy cold air more in my car, instead of frustrating for 50 mins."*

**Refined Approach:**
1. **10-Minute Rule**: If power is out for **10+ minutes** with no signs of restoration (e.g., no streetlights flickering), assume it’s a **1+ hour outage** and head to the car.
2. **Signal Check**: Before descending to the parking lot, step outside your apartment to test signal strength. If weak, drive to a spot with better reception (e.g., near the building entrance) to communicate.
3. **Comfort First**: Prioritize cooling over waiting. Even if power returns sooner, you’ve lost little (e.g., 10 mins of car AC is better than 50 mins of sweating).
4. **Exit Strategy**: If you’re in the car and power returns, you can always go back up. No harm done!

### **Example Scenario for Next Time:**
- **00:06**: Power out. AC off.
- **00:08**: Check phone for outage alerts (some apps like "Power Outage Tracker" show local issues).
- **00:10**: No power restoration. Grab phone, keys, water bottle.
- **00:12**: Step outside apartment to test signal. Weak? Walk to car or drive to building entrance.
- **00:15**: Start car, turn on AC, send message to wife: *"Power out. In car at [location]. Come down if too hot. Will check back in 30 mins."*
- **00:20**: Enjoy cool air, listen to music, or nap.
- **01:03**: Power returns. Drive back up or wait for wife if she’s joining.

### **Final Thought:**
You’re already thinking critically about improving—**that’s the hardest part**. The key is to **act faster next time** and **reduce decision fatigue** by having a clear plan. Power outages are inconvenient, but with small tweaks, you can turn them into minor blips rather than major disruptions.
