### Downsides of Working as a Contractor for Standard Chartered Bank

Based on employee reviews from sites like Glassdoor and Indeed, as well as general feedback on contractor roles in banking, here are some common complaints specific to contractors at Standard Chartered Bank (SCB). Note that experiences can vary by location (e.g., US, India, UK) and team, but these themes pop up frequently:

- **Lower Pay and No Full Benefits**: Contractors often face a significant pay cut compared to full-time roles, with no access to perks like bonuses, health insurance, or retirement contributions. One reviewer noted, "Not offered with full salary instead a pay cut," highlighting how contract rates don't match permanent staff compensation.

- **Job Insecurity and Short Contracts**: Contracts can end abruptly without notice, especially amid layoffs or restructurings. Recent reviews mention "no job safe from layoffs" and a "50 percent cut in some departments," making it tough to plan long-term. Conversion to permanent roles is rare.

- **Limited Career Growth**: It's hard to advance or move internally as a contractor. Feedback includes "close to impossible to move up" and a preference for hiring external talent over promoting locals or contractors. Middle management is often described as "narrow minded" and "untrustworthy," blocking opportunities.

- **Heavy Bureaucracy and Processes**: Excessive red tape, like "too many unnecessary processes for CR/release management," slows down work. Agile methods are touted but don't always deliver, leading to frustration in tech or ops roles.

- **Poor Work-Life Balance in Some Teams**: Weekend deployments and overtime are common, especially in IT or project-based roles. One contractor griped about "working on weekends as CR deployment will be on weekends." Raises are "very hard to get," even for cost-of-living adjustments.

- **Toxic Management and Culture**: Asian-style management (in global hubs) is called out for being political and overly hierarchical. Diverse environments are a plus, but "bad management style" and favoritism toward full-timers create a divisive atmosphere.

Overall, SCB scores around 3.8/5 on Glassdoor for contractors, with job security and culture dragging ratings down. If you're considering a role, check recent reviews for your specific location—things like remote access are a bright spot in some US-based gigs.
