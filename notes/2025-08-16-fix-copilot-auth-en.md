That error usually means **GitHub Copilot Chat** couldn’t find a valid authentication token, so it can’t talk to the Copilot service.
It’s not a coding bug — it’s an **authentication/configuration** problem.

Here’s how to fix it step-by-step depending on where you’re using Copilot Chat:

---

### 1. Make sure you’re signed in with a Copilot-enabled account

* In **VS Code** or **JetBrains** IDE:

  1. Open the Command Palette (**Ctrl+Shift+P** / **Cmd+Shift+P**).
  2. Search for **“GitHub: Sign in”**.
  3. Follow the sign-in process (it will open a browser to authorize).
  4. Ensure the account you signed in with has **an active GitHub Copilot subscription**.
* In **Neovim CLI** (`copilot.vim` or `copilot.lua`):

  * Run `:Copilot sign in` and follow the link in your browser.

---

### 2. Check that GitHub Copilot Chat is enabled

* In VS Code:

  * Go to **Extensions** → search for “GitHub Copilot Chat” → make sure it’s installed and enabled.
  * Settings → search “Copilot Chat: Enabled” → turn it on.

---

### 3. Refresh the authentication token

Sometimes tokens expire or get lost (especially if you changed network, updated the IDE, or switched accounts).

* VS Code:

  1. Command Palette → **“GitHub Copilot: Sign out”**.
  2. Then **“GitHub Copilot: Sign in”** again.
* CLI:

  * Delete the token file (e.g., `~/.config/github-copilot/hosts.json`) and re-sign in.

---

### 4. Check network / firewall restrictions

* If you’re on a corporate VPN or firewall, GitHub Copilot may be blocked from reaching its API.
* Allow access to `github.com`, `api.githubcopilot.com`, and `copilot-proxy.githubusercontent.com`.

---

### 5. Update your IDE and Copilot extensions

* Outdated versions of VS Code or Copilot extensions sometimes cause this issue.
* Update both, then restart your IDE.

---

💡 If you fix the auth but still see errors, GitHub Copilot Chat also requires **Copilot Chat feature access** — some accounts have Copilot for coding but **not Chat** unless it’s explicitly enabled in settings.

If you want, I can give you **the exact VS Code command sequence** to completely reset Copilot Chat’s auth so it re-prompts you fresh. Would you like me to prepare that?
