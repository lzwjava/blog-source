### Performance Comparison in Algorithmic Trading (2025 YTD)

Bridgewater Associates, D.E. Shaw (assuming "DEW" refers to this firm), and Jane Street are all prominent players in quantitative and algorithmic trading, though their strategies differ: Bridgewater focuses on macro with systematic models, D.E. Shaw on multi-strategy quant approaches, and Jane Street on high-frequency market-making and options/ETF arbitrage. Direct apples-to-apples comparisons are challenging due to varying disclosure levels—hedge funds like Bridgewater and D.E. Shaw report returns, while Jane Street (a proprietary trading firm) primarily shares revenue figures.

Based on available 2025 year-to-date (YTD) data through September:

| Firm                  | Key Fund/Strategy                  | YTD Return (through Sep 2025) | Notable 2025 Highlights |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Bridgewater Associates** | Pure Alpha II (Macro/Systematic)  | 26.4%                        | Led the pack of major hedge funds; +8.1% in Q3 alone, driven by tariff volatility and global macro bets. On pace for best year since 2010. |
| **D.E. Shaw**        | Composite (Multi-Strategy Quant)  | 11.6%                        | Solid gains from AI/computational models; Oculus fund at 14%. H1 returns exceeded 7%, one of few large funds to beat the market. |
| **Jane Street**      | Proprietary Trading (HFT/Market-Making) | N/A (Returns not public)     | Record $17.3B trading revenue in H1 (up from $20.5B full-year 2024); Q2 alone hit $10.1B, surpassing Wall Street banks like JPMorgan. Captured ~10% of U.S. equity volume in 2024, with strong 2025 momentum in options and ETFs. |

#### Top Performer Assessment
- **Bridgewater** emerges as the top performer in terms of disclosed returns, with 26.4% YTD far outpacing peers amid 2025's volatile markets. Its algorithmic macro models excelled in navigating uncertainty.
- D.E. Shaw delivered consistent quant-driven gains but lagged Bridgewater.
- Jane Street's explosive revenue growth signals elite algorithmic execution (e.g., in high-speed trading), but without public returns, it's harder to quantify against hedge fund benchmarks. If focusing purely on algo trading volume/profitability, Jane Street leads.

For context, the S&P 500 rose ~14% through Q3 2025, so all outperformed the broad market.
