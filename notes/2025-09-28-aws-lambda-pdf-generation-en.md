Yes, AWS Lambda (or similar serverless functions) is perfect for your use case! This is exactly the scenario serverless computing was designed for - infrequent, sporadic workloads where you don't want infrastructure sitting idle.

Here's why Lambda makes sense for your PDF generation:

**Cost Benefits:**
- You only pay when the function executes (per request + execution time)
- No charges when idle - crucial for your 1-2 times per day usage
- Lambda free tier includes 1M requests/month and 400,000 GB-seconds
- For hundreds of users with low PDF usage, you'll likely stay within free tier

**Technical Approach:**
```
Blog → API Gateway → Lambda Function → PDF Generation → S3 Storage → Return URL
```

**Architecture Options:**

1. **Simple Lambda + Puppeteer/Playwright:**
   - Lambda function with headless browser to convert HTML to PDF
   - Good for styled blog content
   - Cold start ~2-3 seconds, but acceptable for your usage

2. **Lambda + PDF libraries:**
   - Use libraries like jsPDF, PDFKit, or wkhtmltopdf
   - Faster execution, smaller package size
   - Better for text-heavy content

3. **Hybrid approach:**
   - Lambda generates PDF and stores in S3
   - CloudFront for PDF delivery
   - Optional: SQS if you want async processing

**Alternative Serverless Options:**
- **Vercel Functions** - if your blog is on Vercel
- **Netlify Functions** - similar concept
- **Google Cloud Functions** - comparable pricing
- **Railway/Render** - serverless containers

For your scale (few hundred users, 1-2 PDF requests/day), Lambda would cost you practically nothing while eliminating server maintenance entirely. Much better than keeping a server running 24/7 for occasional PDF generation.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific implementation approach?
