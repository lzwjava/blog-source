You’re noticing something very deep: across politics, history, technology, and even personal projects like blogs, *mistakes keep happening*. Whether it’s a government policy leading to conflict, a blog full of broken links, or a software project riddled with bugs, perfection always feels out of reach. Let me unpack why.

---

### 1. Complexity and Limited Foresight

Human systems—nations, economies, or software—are extremely complex. No one can model all variables or predict every consequence.

* Governments may believe a strict lockdown saves lives, but underestimate the long-term social and economic backlash.
* Leaders in 1989 underestimated how much frustration would boil over.
* In code, one small oversight (an off-by-one error, a misconfigured dependency) creates bugs that nobody predicted.

Perfect foresight is impossible because complexity multiplies unintended consequences.

### 2. Conflicting Interests and Trade-offs

Even if we *see* problems, fixing them usually means trade-offs.

* A government may prioritize control over freedom.
* A blogger may prefer publishing quickly rather than checking every link.
* A software team may prioritize shipping features over fixing every tiny bug.

What looks like a “mistake” is often a conscious choice to accept one cost to gain another benefit.

### 3. Human Limits: Cognitive Bias and Error

People are not rational machines. We have biases, blind spots, and fatigue.

* Confirmation bias makes leaders cling to failing policies.
* Typos slip through because our brain autocorrects what we “expect” to see.
* Developers miss bugs because after hours of coding, the mind stops noticing edge cases.

We *can* improve, but our biology makes some error inevitable.

---

### 4. Change Over Time

What was once “right” may later look like a mistake.

* A policy might have worked in one era but becomes harmful in a new social context.
* A piece of code may work fine until new requirements break assumptions.
* A blog link was valid when published, but later the referenced site disappeared (link rot).

The world doesn’t stand still, so perfection decays.

### 5. The Asymmetry of Error vs. Perfection

To succeed perfectly, *everything* has to go right. To fail, only one thing has to go wrong.

* One bug can crash a program.
* One 404 breaks user trust.
* One wrong political calculation can trigger protest.

Perfection is fragile, error is resilient.

### 6. Why “Perfect” Is So Hard

* **Infinite detail**: There’s always more you *could* check, more scenarios to test.
* **Resource limits**: Time, money, attention are finite.
* **Human condition**: Our evolution didn’t prepare us for flawless execution, but for “good enough to survive.”

That’s why software always has bugs, history always has conflict, and even polished blogs have rough edges.

👉 The takeaway: **mistakes are not exceptions, they’re the default**. Progress comes not from eliminating all mistakes (impossible), but from *detecting, learning, and correcting faster* than the damage they cause.

Would you like me to give you a **practical framework** (like principles or habits) for dealing with mistakes—both in code and in life—so you can turn them into advantages instead of frustrations?
