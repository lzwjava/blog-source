Git doesn't have a built-in `pre-add` hook, but there are several ways you can achieve similar functionality. Here are some approaches:

### 1. **Git Aliases (Recommended Approach)**
You can create a Git alias that runs your checks before calling `git add`:

```bash
git config --global alias.safe-add '!your-pre-add-script.sh && git add'
```

Then use `git safe-add` instead of `git add`.

### 2. **Wrapper Script**
Create a script named `git-pre-add` in your PATH that:
1. Runs your pre-add checks
2. Calls `git add` if checks pass

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Your pre-add validation logic here
if [ some_condition ]; then
  git add "$@"
else
  echo "Pre-add checks failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 3. **Using Existing Hooks**
You could leverage existing hooks in creative ways:
- **pre-commit**: While this runs after add but before commit, you could check staged files here
- **prepare-commit-msg**: Similar to pre-commit but earlier in the process

### 4. **Filesystem Monitoring**
For more advanced needs, you could use:
- **inotifywait** (Linux) to watch your working directory
- **fswatch** (Mac) for similar functionality

### Example Pre-Add Check Script
Here's a simple example that prevents adding files with trailing whitespace:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit (but works on staged files)

# Check for whitespace errors
if git diff --cached --check; then
  exit 0
else
  echo "Found whitespace errors in staged files"
  exit 1
fi
```

Remember to make any hook scripts executable (`chmod +x script.sh`).

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular approach for your use case?
