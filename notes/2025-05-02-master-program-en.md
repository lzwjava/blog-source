Okay, let's break down your profile and assess your chances for Master's programs in Singapore, the UK, the USA, and Australia.

First, your profile has some significant strengths:

1.  **Extensive and Diverse Professional Experience:** 10 years total, with strong corporate roles (HSBC, DBS) and varied technical expertise (mobile, full-stack, ML/Big Data). This is a huge plus for many Master's programs, especially those with a practical or industry focus.
2.  **Strong Technical Skills & Portfolio:** Your detailed list of technologies, cloud familiarity, extensive GitHub portfolio (with high commit counts), and personal projects (campus app, English app) demonstrate strong practical ability, initiative, and passion.
3.  **Algorithmic Background & Problem Solving:** Your performance in NOIP and ACM/ICPC shows a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals and competitive programming skills.
4.  **Self-Taught Ability & Initiative:** Pursuing the associate degree through self-study, solving 1000 algorithm problems, reading widely, and conducting self-taught research on vision restoration highlight your strong ability to learn independently and pursue interests deeply.
5.  **Research Interest:** Your academic-style papers, even outside a formal academic setting, show intellectual curiosity and the ability to engage with complex topics.
6.  **English Proficiency:** IELTS 6 meets the minimum requirement for *some* universities, though not all, especially more competitive ones.

Now, let's look at the challenges and the primary requirement for most Master's programs:

1.  **Lack of a Completed Bachelor's Degree:** This is the most significant hurdle. Master's programs almost universally require a completed Bachelor's degree (typically a 4-year program or equivalent) from a recognized institution. Your one year at Beijing Forestry University (dropout) and the ongoing Associate Degree (which is typically a 2-year program and not yet completed) mean you do not currently meet this standard requirement.
2.  **Associate Degree vs. Bachelor's:** An Associate Degree, especially one pursued through self-study exams, is generally *not* considered equivalent to a Bachelor's degree for direct entry into a Master's program in these countries. It might qualify you for entry into the later years of a Bachelor's program, but rarely straight into a Master's.
3.  **IELTS Score:** While 6 is acceptable in some cases, many universities, particularly competitive ones, require a higher score (e.g., 6.5 or 7.0 overall, often with minimums in each band).

**Assessment by Country:**

* **General:** The lack of a Bachelor's degree is the primary barrier across the board for standard Master's programs.
* **Singapore:** Highly competitive universities (NUS, NTU) strictly require a Bachelor's degree, usually with a strong GPA. An Associate Degree is unlikely to be sufficient for direct entry.
* **UK:** Universities are quite strict on degree requirements (usually a 2:1 or 1st class Bachelor's). An Associate Degree alone is highly unlikely to grant entry to a Master's. IELTS 6 might be borderline for many programs; 6.5 or 7.0 is more common.
* **USA:** Requires a 4-year Bachelor's degree. While professional experience is valued for graduate admissions, it rarely substitutes for the foundational degree. An Associate Degree is insufficient. IELTS 6 is often too low for graduate programs; 7.0+ is common for competitive CS programs, and GRE might also be required.
* **Australia:** Similar to the UK and USA, requires a completed Bachelor's degree. IELTS 6 is often the minimum *overall*, but sections might need to be higher. Competitive programs will want higher. An Associate Degree is insufficient for direct Master's entry.

**Conclusion:**

Based on standard admission requirements, **it is highly unlikely you will be able to apply directly to a Master's program** in Singapore, the UK, the USA, or Australia without a completed Bachelor's degree. Your impressive work experience, skills, and projects are valuable, but they typically cannot substitute for the fundamental academic credential of a Bachelor's degree for Master's level study.

**Possible Pathways & Recommendations:**

1.  **Prioritize Completing Your Associate Degree:** Finish your current program. This is the immediate next step in formal education.
2.  **Seek a Bachelor's Degree:** The most direct path to Master's eligibility is to obtain a Bachelor's degree.
    * See if your Associate Degree credits can transfer into a Bachelor's program, potentially allowing you to enter in the second or third year. Look for Bachelor's programs in Computer Science or a related field.
    * Consider Bachelor's programs in China or potentially online programs from recognized international institutions, focusing on completing the degree.
3.  **Improve Your IELTS Score:** While pursuing further education, aim to retake the IELTS and score at least 6.5, preferably 7.0 or higher, to meet the language requirements for more universities when you eventually apply for a Master's.
4.  **Research Alternative Entry Options (with Caution):** Very, very rarely, some universities *might* have alternative entry routes for individuals with *exceptional* professional experience in lieu of a standard degree. These are uncommon for technical Master's degrees and more likely for professional Master's or MBAs. You would need to meticulously check the specific admission requirements of individual programs and universities, looking for options like "Recognition of Prior Learning" or specific provisions for mature students with extensive work experience. Be prepared for this route to be difficult and less common.
5.  **Consider Postgraduate Diplomas/Certificates:** These are shorter qualifications than a Master's and might have slightly more flexible entry requirements, potentially considering a combination of your Associate Degree progress and extensive work experience. Completing a postgraduate diploma could sometimes serve as a stepping stone or pathway to a Master's, but again, check specific university progression rules.

In summary, while your professional background is outstanding, the lack of a Bachelor's degree is a major obstacle for standard Master's applications. Your most realistic path is to focus on completing your current Associate Degree and then exploring options to obtain a Bachelor's degree, which will then make you eligible for Master's programs.
