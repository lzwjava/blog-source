A bee sting is usually not dangerous for most people, but the severity depends on several factors. Here's a quick breakdown:

- **Typical Reaction**: Pain, redness, swelling, and itching at the sting site. These symptoms usually subside within a few hours to a couple of days. Over-the-counter remedies like antihistamines, hydrocortisone cream, or cold compresses can help.

- **Allergic Reactions**: For some, bee stings can trigger an allergic reaction:
  - **Mild Allergic Reaction**: Hives, itching beyond the sting site, or mild swelling.
  - **Severe Allergic Reaction (Anaphylaxis)**: Rare but life-threatening. Symptoms include difficulty breathing, swelling of the throat or tongue, dizziness, rapid pulse, or loss of consciousness. This requires immediate medical attention (call emergency services or use an epinephrine auto-injector like an EpiPen if available).

- **Risk Factors**:
  - **Allergy History**: If you’ve had a severe reaction to a sting before, you’re at higher risk for anaphylaxis.
  - **Multiple Stings**: Being stung multiple times (e.g., by a swarm) can lead to a toxic reaction from venom overload, causing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or fever. This is more dangerous and requires urgent care.
  - **Location of Sting**: Stings in sensitive areas like the mouth, throat, or eyes can cause swelling that may obstruct breathing or vision, needing prompt attention.

- **What to Do**:
  1. Remove the stinger quickly (scrape it off with a card or fingernail; don’t squeeze it).
  2. Wash the area with soap and water.
  3. Apply a cold pack and consider pain relievers or antihistamines.
  4. Monitor for signs of a severe reaction (e.g., trouble breathing, swelling, or dizziness). Seek emergency care if these occur.

- **When It’s Dangerous**:
  - You have a known bee sting allergy.
  - You experience symptoms of anaphylaxis.
  - You’re stung multiple times (more than 10-20 stings can be serious, especially in children or smaller adults).
  - The sting is in a critical area like the throat.

If you’re unsure about your reaction or have a history of allergies, consult a doctor or allergist. For most people, a single bee sting is painful but not dangerous. If you need real-time advice or suspect a severe reaction, call a medical professional immediately.
