The idea of increasingly complex software stacks with hundreds of layers is an interesting topic in software development and architecture. As technology evolves, several trends and challenges could emerge:

1. **Abstraction Layers**: More abstraction layers can simplify development by allowing developers to build on top of existing platforms and frameworks. This can speed up development and reduce the need to "reinvent the wheel" for common functionalities.

2. **Complexity Management**: With more layers, managing complexity becomes crucial. Tools and practices for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining software will need to evolve. Techniques like observability, distributed tracing, and advanced logging will become even more important.

3. **Performance Considerations**: Each layer can introduce some level of overhead. As the number of layers increases, performance optimization will become critical to ensure that applications remain responsive and efficient.

4. **Security**: More layers can mean more potential vulnerabilities. Ensuring security across a complex stack will require robust practices and tools to identify and mitigate risks at each layer.

5. **Developer Experience**: The developer experience will need to adapt. Integrated development environments (IDEs), debugging tools, and documentation will need to handle deeper stacks and provide insights across multiple layers.

6. **Interoperability and Standards**: As systems become more layered, standards and interoperability between layers and components will be essential. This ensures that different parts of the stack can work together seamlessly.

7. **Education and Training**: Developers will need to understand not just their immediate layer of work but also how it interacts with other layers. This might require more comprehensive education and training programs.

8. **Innovation and Flexibility**: While more layers can add complexity, they can also provide more opportunities for innovation. Developers can leverage existing layers to build new and creative solutions.

In the context of platforms like WeChat, which already support multiple layers of applications (e.g., mini-apps), we can see some of these trends in action. These platforms provide a foundation that others can build upon, creating ecosystems of applications and services.

Overall, while a future with hundreds of layers in the software stack presents challenges, it also offers opportunities for creating more powerful, flexible, and innovative applications. The key will be developing the tools, practices, and knowledge needed to manage this complexity effectively.
