Chen Gao is a distinguished mathematician and professor known for his significant contributions to complex differential geometry, Kähler geometry, hyperkähler geometry, and G2 geometry. Below is a comprehensive introduction to his background, academic journey, research achievements, and impact on the mathematical community, based on available information and critically assessed for accuracy.

### Early Life and Education
Chen Gao was born in Rui'an, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China, around 1993-1994, given that he was reported to be 26 years old in 2021 and 28 in 2022. Wenzhou is notable for its strong mathematical heritage, dubbed the "hometown of mathematicians" by Wolf Prize winner Shiing-Shen Chern. Gao's early exposure to mathematics was shaped by his father, who encouraged innovative thinking and self-learning, freeing him from rote memorization and standard answers. This approach fostered Gao's ability to tackle complex problems creatively.[](http://en.foshannews.net/News/202103/t20210302_6367341.html)[](https://www.wzu.edu.cn/info/1505/41084.htm)[](https://www.wzu.edu.cn/info/1505/41084.htm)

Gao demonstrated exceptional mathematical talent early on. By age 18, he moved to the United States to pursue a Ph.D., likely at Stony Brook University, given his later affiliations and the presence of his mentor, Xiuxiong Chen, at that institution. His doctoral work focused on advanced topics in geometry, laying the foundation for his later breakthroughs.[](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/cards/chengao.html)[](http://en.foshannews.net/News/202103/t20210302_6367341.html)

### Research Contributions
Chen Gao's work primarily focuses on complex differential geometry, a field that bridges mathematics and physics through the study of geometric structures on complex manifolds. His research has addressed long-standing problems, earning him international recognition. Key contributions include:

1. **The J-Equation and Supercritical Deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills Equation**:
   - In 2021, Gao published a seminal paper in *Inventiones Mathematicae*, one of the top mathematics journals, titled "The J-equation and the supercritical deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation." This work solved two critical equations proposed by prominent mathematicians, including Xiuxiong Chen, Simon Donaldson, and Shing-Tung Yau, under the premise of stability.[](http://en.foshannews.net/News/202103/t20210302_6367341.html)[](https://www.yqqlm.com/2021/02/a-26-year-old-mathematician-from-the-university-of-science-and-technology-of-china-overcomes-world-problems-in-the-field-of-complex-differential-geometry/)
   - Gao established a bridge between the Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation (central to quantum mechanics) and the Kähler-Einstein equation (linked to general relativity). Reviewers praised his introduction of two bold ideas, noting that such results are "extremely rare."[](https://www.yqqlm.com/2021/02/a-26-year-old-mathematician-from-the-university-of-science-and-technology-of-china-overcomes-world-problems-in-the-field-of-complex-differential-geometry/)
   - This breakthrough advanced complex differential geometry by providing new insights into the interplay between geometric and physical theories.[](http://en.foshannews.net/News/202103/t20210302_6367341.html)

2. **Gravitational Instantons with Quadratic Volume Growth**:
   - In collaboration with Xiuxiong Chen, Gao proved in 2015 (at age 21) that there are only four types of gravitational instantons with quadratic volume growth.[](https://www.wzu.edu.cn/info/1505/41084.htm)
   - This result, published in a series of papers in *Acta Mathematica*, *Mathematische Annalen*, and *Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik* (Crelle’s Journal), classified gravitational instantons with faster-than-quadratic curvature decay.[](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengao1/)[](https://www.math.ias.edu/~gchen/)
   - These findings have implications for understanding geometric structures in higher-dimensional spaces and their applications in theoretical physics, particularly in general relativity and string theory.

3. **G2 Manifolds and Singularities**:
   - Gao’s work on G2 manifolds, which are seven-dimensional geometric structures relevant to string theory, includes studies of nodal singularities along circles and asymptotic convergence near isolated singularities.[](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengao1/)[](https://www.math.ias.edu/~gchen/)
   - His papers, such as "G2 manifolds with nodal singularities along circles" (*The Journal of Geometric Analysis*, 2021) and "Shi-type estimates and finite time singularities of flows of G2 structures" (*The Quarterly Journal of Mathematics*, 2018), have advanced the understanding of singularities in exceptional holonomy manifolds.[](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengao1/)

4. **Collaborative Works with Jeff Viaclovsky and Ruobing Zhang**:
   - Gao co-authored several papers with Jeff Viaclovsky and Ruobing Zhang, including:
     - "Torelli-type theorems for gravitational instantons with quadratic volume growth" (*Duke Mathematical Journal*, 2024), which developed topological and analytical tools for gravitational instantons.[](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengao1/)
     - "Hodge theory on ALG* manifolds" (*Crelle’s Journal*, 2023) and "Collapsing Ricci-flat metrics on elliptic K3 surfaces" (*Communications in Analysis and Geometry*, 2020), which explored geometric collapsing and asymptotic behaviors.[](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengao1/)
   - These works have deepened the understanding of hyperkähler and Ricci-flat geometries, with applications in algebraic geometry and theoretical physics.

5. **Asymptotic Geometry of Moduli Spaces**:
   - With Nianzi Li, Gao studied the asymptotic geometry of the moduli space of rank-two irregular Higgs bundles over the projective line, as detailed in a 2022 arXiv preprint. This work contributes to the study of moduli spaces, which are central to modern geometry and physics.[](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengao1/)

### Impact and Philosophy
Gao’s research has had a profound impact on complex differential geometry, a field with deep connections to physics, including quantum mechanics, general relativity, and string theory. His ability to solve equations that had eluded mathematicians for decades has positioned him as a leading figure in his field. His work on gravitational instantons and G2 manifolds has practical implications for theoretical physics, while his contributions to Kähler and hyperkähler geometry have advanced pure mathematics.

Gao has described the process of solving mathematical problems as a "long run that sometimes goes on for several generations," emphasizing the collaborative and cumulative nature of mathematical progress. His innovative approach, rooted in his early self-learning habits, allows him to tackle uncharted problems with novel perspectives.[](https://www.wzu.edu.cn/info/1505/41084.htm)

### Critical Assessment
While the sources provide a consistent picture of Gao’s achievements, some details, such as his exact birth year or the precise timeline of his Ph.D., are inferred due to limited biographical data. The claim that he solved "world problems" should be understood in the context of significant mathematical challenges rather than universally recognized global issues. Additionally, his work’s impact on physics, while promising, is primarily theoretical and awaits broader application. The consistency of his publications across top journals (*Inventiones Mathematicae*, *Acta Mathematica*, *Duke Mathematical Journal*) and his affiliations with leading institutions (USTC, IAS, Stony Brook) lend strong credibility to his profile.[](http://en.foshannews.net/News/202103/t20210302_6367341.html)

### Conclusion
Chen Gao is a prodigious mathematician whose work in complex differential geometry has earned him global recognition. From solving the J-equation to classifying gravitational instantons and advancing G2 geometry, his contributions have reshaped key areas of mathematics and opened new avenues for research in physics. As a professor at USTC and a recipient of the ICCM Silver Medal, Gao continues to inspire the next generation of mathematicians. His story, rooted in Wenzhou’s mathematical legacy and driven by innovative thinking, underscores the power of persistence and creativity in tackling some of the most challenging problems in modern mathematics.
