### Avaloq Error Codes and Responses

Avaloq is a proprietary core banking software platform used by financial institutions worldwide for tasks like account management, trading, and compliance. Its error codes and responses are not publicly standardized like those in open-source systems (e.g., HTTP errors or SQL codes), as they are designed to be secure and specific to the platform's architecture. This helps prevent exploitation, so detailed public documentation is limited—access typically requires an Avaloq license or partnership.

#### Typical Structure of Avaloq Errors
From general knowledge of Avaloq's system (based on developer forums, support snippets, and industry reports), errors often follow this pattern:
- **Format**: Errors are usually prefixed with "ERR-" or a numeric code, followed by a descriptive message. They can be categorized by module (e.g., ACS for Core Services, AMS for Asset Management).
- **Code Ranges**: 
  - Common codes are in the 1000–9999 range, often grouped by severity or type:
    - **1000s**: General system errors (e.g., authentication failures, invalid inputs).
    - **2000s**: Business logic errors (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid transaction types).
    - **3000s–5000s**: Integration or data errors (e.g., API failures, database constraints).
    - **6000s+**: Module-specific (e.g., compliance or reporting issues).
  - Examples of known or typical codes (not exhaustive, as these vary by version like R16–R23):
    - **ERR-1001**: Invalid user credentials or session timeout. Response: "Authentication failed. Please log in again."
    - **ERR-2005**: Insufficient balance for transaction. Response: "Transaction rejected: Account balance too low."
    - **ERR-3002**: Data validation error. Response: "Invalid input format detected in field [X]."
    - **ERR-4004**: API endpoint not found or unauthorized. Response: "Service unavailable or access denied."
    - **ERR-5001**: Internal server error (often transient). Response: "System temporarily unavailable. Retry later."

#### Error Response Format
Avaloq APIs and interfaces (e.g., via REST/SOAP) typically return structured JSON or XML responses like this:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "ERR-2005",
  "errorMessage": "Transaction rejected: Account balance too low.",
  "severity": "ERROR",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-05T14:30:00Z",
  "details": {
    "accountId": "ACC123456",
    "requiredBalance": 1000.00,
    "currentBalance": 500.00
  }
}
```

- **HTTP Status Codes**: Often wrapped in standard HTTP responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request for client errors, 500 Internal Server Error for system issues).
- **Severity Levels**: INFO, WARNING, ERROR, FATAL—ERROR/FATAL halt operations.
- **Logging**: Errors are logged in Avaloq's audit trails for compliance (e.g., under Basel III standards), with codes like "AVQ-ERR-XXXX" for traceability.

#### How to Handle or Find More
- **Official Sources**: These are best obtained from Avaloq's developer portal, knowledge base, or support (e.g., via MyAvaloq portal). If you're a user/developer, check the Avaloq Core Platform documentation or contact Avaloq support (part of NEC Corporation now).
- **Troubleshooting Tips**:
  - Use the system's trace/debug tools (e.g., in Avaloq's Eclipse-based IDE).
  - Common causes: Input validation failures, network issues, or configuration mismatches.
  - For testing: Avaloq provides sandbox environments for partners.
- **Security Note**: Sharing or reverse-engineering error codes outside authorized channels could violate licensing agreements.

If you have a specific error code or context (e.g., from a log), provide more details for tailored advice. I'm not affiliated with Avaloq, so this is based on publicly available info—always verify with official resources!
