title: TiDB's Challenges and 2025 Alternatives
translated: false
type: note
---

I'll search for recent information about TiDB's current status and alternatives people are using in 2025.Let me search for more specific information about TiDB's technical challenges and limitations.TiDB's design challenges stem from attempting to implement Google Spanner and F1's concepts without the specialized hardware that makes them practical. Here are the key issues:

## Core Design Problems

**Hardware Dependency**: TiDB uses "the Timestamp Allocator introduced in Percolator" but "if there are multiple datacenters, especially if these DCs are geologically distributed, the latency is really high" because it lacks Google's specialized atomic clock hardware (TrueTime) that makes Spanner's design work efficiently.

**Resource Overhead**: TiDB's distributed nature necessitates more resources compared to traditional relational databases, requiring multiple components (TiDB servers, PD servers, TiKV nodes) on separate machines, which increases hardware and operational costs.

**Operational Complexity**: It's challenging to troubleshoot issues in a distributed database because the information about the system is scattered in different machines.

## What People Are Using Instead in 2025

Based on the search results, organizations are choosing several alternatives:

**Cloud-Native Solutions**: Many are moving to fully managed services like Google Cloud SQL, Amazon Aurora, and other cloud database services that handle the operational complexity.

**Specialized Use Cases**: Some companies like Plaid are still transitioning to TiDB by mid-2025, but they're dealing with significant migration challenges including removing foreign keys and enforcing primary keys for compatibility.

**Traditional Sharded Approaches**: Many organizations are returning to proven MySQL/PostgreSQL sharding strategies with better tooling rather than dealing with distributed SQL complexity.

**Modern Alternatives**: Companies are exploring other distributed databases like CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, or purpose-built solutions that don't try to replicate Spanner's architecture without its hardware foundation.

The fundamental issue is that TiDB attempted to recreate Spanner's benefits without Google's specialized infrastructure, leading to higher latency, increased complexity, and operational overhead that often outweighs the scaling benefits for most use cases.
