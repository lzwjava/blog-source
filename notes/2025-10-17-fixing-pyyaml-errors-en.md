title: Fixing PyYAML Installation Errors
translated: false

### Understanding the Error

This output appears to be from a `python setup.py install` or `pip install pyyaml` (from source) on a Linux system with Python 3.13. There are two main issues:

1. **Compilation Failure for C Extension**:
   - The build process is trying to compile the C extension (`yaml._yaml`) but can't find the source file `yaml/_yaml.c`.
   - This happens because newer versions of PyYAML (starting around 4.x) generate the `_yaml.c` file dynamically using Cython during the build. The source distribution on PyPI doesn't include the pre-generated `.c` file, so Cython must be installed beforehand to create it.
   - As a result, it falls back to the pure Python version (which works but is slower and lacks some features like libyaml support).

2. **Permission Denied During Installation**:
   - The install is attempting to write to the system-wide Python directory (`/usr/local/lib/python3.13/dist-packages`), which requires root privileges.
   - This is common when running without `sudo` or the `--user` flag.

### Solutions

#### Fix the Compilation Issue
Install Cython first, then retry the PyYAML installation. This will generate the missing `_yaml.c` file and allow the C extension to build.

- **Using pip (recommended)**:
  ```
  pip install cython
  pip install pyyaml
  ```
  - If you want the faster C extension with libyaml support (requires system libyaml-dev installed via your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt install libyaml-dev` on Ubuntu/Debian):
    ```
    pip install cython libyaml
    pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir pyyaml
    ```

- **If using setup.py directly** (not recommended, prefer pip):
  ```
  pip install cython
  python setup.py build_ext --inplace
  python setup.py install
  ```

Note: Python 3.13 is relatively new, so ensure you're using the latest Cython (e.g., 3.0.11 or newer) for compatibility. If you're on a free-threaded Python build, there may be additional compilation tweaks needed—check PyYAML's GitHub issues for updates.

#### Fix the Permission Issue
- **Install to user directory** (safest, no sudo needed):
  ```
  pip install --user cython pyyaml
  ```
  - This installs to `~/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages`.

- **Use sudo for system-wide install** (use cautiously, as it can conflict with package managers):
  ```
  sudo pip install cython pyyaml
  ```

- **Best Practice: Use a Virtual Environment**:
  To avoid permission issues entirely:
  ```
  python -m venv myenv
  source myenv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
  pip install cython pyyaml
  ```
  This keeps everything isolated.

After installation, test with `python -c "import yaml; print(yaml.__version__)"`. If it imports without errors, you're good.

If these don't resolve it (e.g., due to a specific Python 3.13 quirk), provide more details like your exact command and OS version.
