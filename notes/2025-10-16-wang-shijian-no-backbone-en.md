### Wang Shijian "No Backbone" Popular Song AI Prompt Generation (English Version)

Based on your request, I've generated AI prompts for Wang Shijian's viral hit song "No Backbone" (derived from his iconic interrogation line against Ko Wen-je: "It should have been calm and composed, masterful and at ease, but now it's frantic and flustered, scrambling and tumbling. What are you choking up about? Why are you crying? No backbone!"). These prompts are suitable for AI tools to create music, images, or videos, compatible with platforms like Suno AI, Midjourney, or Runway. The song's style is electronic, catchy, and satirical, with over 200 million views on Douyin, beloved by audiences across the Taiwan Strait.

Here are 3 prompts tailored to different scenarios, concise yet detailed, ready for direct input into AI tools.

#### 1. **AI Image Generation Prompt (Song Cover Design)**
```
Design a satirical pop album cover for Taiwanese politician Wang Shijian's viral song "No Backbone." In the center, a middle-aged man (Wang Shijian) with intense eyes, furrowed brows, slamming a desk as if holding back tears, dressed in a suit, standing in a chaotic Taiwanese legislative chamber. Background blends neon blue and red electronic sound waves, protest signs, microphones, with Chinese meme text "从从容容游刃有余" (calm and composed, masterful and at ease) fading into "匆匆忙忙连滚带爬" (frantic and flustered, scrambling and tumbling). Style: cyberpunk mixed with pop art, inspired by Andy Warhol and K-pop covers, high contrast, ultra-detailed, 4K resolution.
```

#### 2. **AI Music/Lyrics Generation Prompt (Song Remix Version)**
```
Create an electronic pop remix of Taiwanese legislator Wang Shijian's interrogation rant-turned-song "No Backbone." Core lyrics: "本来应该从从容容、游刃有余，现在是匆匆忙忙、连滚带爬，你在哽咽什么啦，你在哭什么哭？没出息！" (Include English subtitles for global appeal). Genre: high-energy EDM with heavy bass, auto-tune mimicking Wang's passionate, choking vocals. Add a humorous rap verse on political scandals or everyday failures (like rushing homework or failed diets). Tempo: 128 BPM, length: 3 minutes, incorporate meme sound effects (desk slams, crowd cheers). Optimized for viral spread on Douyin/TikTok.
```

#### 3. **AI Video/MV Generation Prompt (Dynamic Short Clip)**
```
Generate a 30-second animated music video for Wang Shijian's hit "No Backbone." Scene 1: A calm office worker (symbolizing "calm and composed") transforms into a frantic runner ("scrambling and tumbling") against a backdrop fusing Taipei's legislative hall and Beijing streets. Sync lyrics to visuals: desk-slamming rage at 5s, teary breakdown with rain effects at 15s. Style: 2D anime blended with real clips of Wang's interrogation, fast cuts, glitch effects, popping neon Chinese subtitles. Music: electronic remix with vocal chops. End with meme text: "Cross-strait resonance, no backbone!" High-energy, humorous, 1080p, loopable for social media.

These prompts are optimized in English while preserving the song's core elements, perfect for direct use in AI tools. If you need style tweaks (e.g., rock version, ballad), platform-specific optimizations, or additions like other politicians in a "group chorus," just provide more details for customization!
