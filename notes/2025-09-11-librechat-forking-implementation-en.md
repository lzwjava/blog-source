title: LibreChat Conversation Forking Implementation Details
translated: false
---

Great question! **LibreChat** (v0.8.0-rc3) has had **conversation forking** (branching) for a while, and it works differently from OpenAI's recent implementation. Here's how it functions in LibreChat and how it compares to ChatGPT's approach:

---

### **How Forking Works in LibreChat**
1. **Manual Branching**
   - LibreChat allows you to **explicitly fork** a conversation at any point by clicking the **"Fork"** button (usually near the message you want to branch from).
   - This creates a **new conversation** that starts from the selected message, preserving all prior context up to that point.

2. **Independent Paths**
   - After forking, changes in the new branch **do not affect the original conversation**.
   - You can explore different directions (e.g., debugging approaches, creative ideas) without losing the original thread.

3. **No Auto-Forking (Unlike ChatGPT)**
   - LibreChat **does not automatically fork** conversations when you edit messages (unlike ChatGPT’s recent "branch on edit" feature).
   - You must **manually** choose when to fork.

4. **Backend Implementation**
   - LibreChat stores conversation history in a structured way (e.g., using `conversationId` and `parentMessageId` in its database).
   - When you fork, it creates a new `conversationId` while reusing the parent messages up to the fork point.

### **Comparison with ChatGPT’s Forking**

| Feature               | LibreChat (v0.8.0-rc3)       | ChatGPT (Recent Update)       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Trigger**           | Manual (click "Fork")       | Automatic (on message edit)   |
| **Use Case**          | Exploring alternatives      | Recovering from edits         |
| **UI Indication**     | Clear branch list           | Subtle "View edited version"  |
| **Persistence**       | Saved in DB                 | Temporary (session-based?)    |
| **Multi-Branch**      | Yes (multiple forks)        | Limited (single edit branch)  |

### **Why LibreChat Had It Earlier**
1. **Open-Source Flexibility**
   - LibreChat is built on top of APIs like OpenAI’s but adds its own **conversation management layer**.
   - Forking was a natural feature for a self-hosted chat platform where users want **full control** over conversation history.

2. **Designed for Workflows**
   - LibreChat targets **developers, researchers, and teams** who need to:
     - Test different prompts without losing context.
     - Compare AI responses side-by-side.
     - Collaborate on branched discussions.

3. **No Vendor Lock-in**
   - Unlike ChatGPT (which ties forking to OpenAI’s backend), LibreChat’s forking works **regardless of the AI provider** (e.g., works the same for Claude, Gemini, or local models).

---

### **How to Use Forking in LibreChat**
1. **Fork a Conversation**:
   - Hover over a message → Click **"Fork"** (or use the conversation menu).
   - A new chat will open with all messages up to that point.

2. **Manage Branches**:
   - Use the **sidebar** to switch between original and forked conversations.
   - Rename branches for clarity (e.g., "Debugging Approach A" vs. "Approach B").

3. **Merge Context (Advanced)**:
   - While LibreChat doesn’t auto-merge, you can **copy-paste** key messages between branches.

---

### **Example Workflow**
1. You’re debugging a Python script with an AI.
2. At message #5, you fork to try a **different approach**.
3. In the original branch, you continue with Approach A.
4. In the forked branch, you test Approach B.
5. Compare results later without retyping context.

---

### **Limitations**
- **No Visual Diff**: Unlike Git branches, LibreChat doesn’t show differences between forks (yet).
- **Storage**: Too many forks may bloat your database (clean up old branches periodically).

---
### **Under the Hood (Technical)**
LibreChat’s forking relies on:
- **MongoDB/PostgreSQL**: Stores conversations with `parentMessageId` references.
- **Frontend State**: React manages active branches in the UI.
- **API Abstraction**: Works uniformly across all AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

---
### **Future Improvements (Possibly in Later Versions)**
- **Auto-fork on edits** (like ChatGPT).
- **Branch comparison** (side-by-side view).
- **Merge functionality** (combine two branches).
