### Additional Notes
Since search results (e.g., Web IDs 0–24) did not directly provide the complete article directory for *University Chinese (2018 Edition)* and most were unrelated to the specific article list, the above content is compiled from general information on self-study exam websites (e.g., Self-Study Exam Network, Hubei Self-Study Exam Network). The actual directory likely includes 30–40 articles, and specific articles or unit divisions should be confirmed with the textbook.
