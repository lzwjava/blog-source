You’re looking for an **open-source, Python-friendly chat UI**, similar to OpenWeb-UI—but specifically compatible with **OpenRouter** (so you can bring your own API keys) and ideally able to run locally.

Here are some great options (no table comparisons, just a clean list):

---

### 1. **LibreChat**

* A polished, open-source ChatGPT-style UI with powerful features like multi-user support, agent building, plugin systems, and rich context controls. Uses familiar web interface patterns.
* Works with **custom endpoints**, meaning you can plug in **OpenRouter APIs** easily. ([GitHub][1])

**Why it fits your needs:**

* Supports OpenRouter directly.
* Rich Python backend (Node/React UI), lots of extensibility.
* Actively developed and easy to self-host.

---

### 2. **AnythingLLM**

* A versatile chat app that integrates local models, document Q\&A, agents, RAG workflows—and **explicitly supports OpenRouter**. ([APIpie.ai][2], [AnythingLLM][3])

**Why it fits your needs:**

* Python-friendly stack and supports desktop or server deployment.
* Great for interacting with your own knowledge bases, choosing models, and building specialized agents.

---

### 3. **Chatbot UI**

* A clean, minimalist open-source chat interface with support for both cloud and local models. It supports ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Ollama, and others—and implicitly OpenRouter through custom endpoints. ([APIpie.ai][2], [Helicone.ai][4])

**Why it fits your needs:**

* Lightweight and easy to use.
* Database-backed, sleek UI, self-hostable.

---

### 4. **Hugging Face Chat-UI**

* A SvelteKit-based chat interface powering HuggingChat, designed to talk to open source models like LLaMA. It supports OpenAI-compatible local endpoints, which makes it adaptable to OpenRouter. ([GitHub][5])

**Why it fits your needs:**

* Modern single-page app, local model support.
* Great if you’re comfortable with Svelte and want a UI you can deploy quickly.

---

### 5. **Open WebUI** *(Mentioned as the baseline)*

* You’re already familiar: multi-model orchestration, plugin pipelines, Python support—but built around Ollama and local models primarily. ([APIpie.ai][2])
* While powerful, integration with OpenRouter isn't central—so the above tools are more tailored to your requirement of BYO-key via OpenRouter.

### Quick Recommendation

If you're after **full OpenRouter integration with strong UI, Python backend compatibility, and local deploy**, here’s what I'd suggest:

* **Top Pick**: **LibreChat** — mature, extensible, direct OpenRouter support, rich UI/agent features.
* **Runner Up**: **AnythingLLM** — great for document-centric workflows and flexible deployment.
* **Lightweight Option**: **Chatbot UI** — simple, elegant, easy to host.
* **Modern UI Option**: **Hugging Face Chat-UI** — SvelteKit, elegant if you don’t mind adapting it slightly for OpenRouter.
