### Introduction to Jaipur, India

Jaipur, the vibrant capital of Rajasthan, is one of India's most iconic cities, often called the "Pink City" for its distinctive terracotta-hued buildings. Founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II as a planned urban center to replace the older hilltop fort of Amber, it was designed by the renowned architect Vidyadhar Bhattacharya in a grid layout inspired by ancient Hindu texts. This walled city, nestled against the Aravalli Hills, seamlessly blends Rajput, Mughal, and European architectural influences, reflecting Rajasthan's royal heritage.

The nickname "Pink City" originated in 1876 when the entire city was painted pink—a color symbolizing hospitality in Rajasthani culture—to welcome the visiting Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII). A law soon mandated that all buildings maintain this shade, giving Jaipur its enduring rosy glow. Today, with a population exceeding 3 million, it's a bustling metropolis where history meets modernity, famous for its handicrafts, jewelry, textiles, and lively bazaars.

Jaipur's cultural tapestry is woven with royal legacies, including grand palaces, forts, and observatories. Key highlights include:
- **Amber Fort (Amer Fort)**: A majestic hilltop complex with intricate mirror work and elephant rides.
- **Hawa Mahal**: The "Palace of Winds," a five-story honeycomb facade built for royal women to observe street life.
- **City Palace**: A royal residence-turned-museum housing artifacts, courtyards, and the Chandra Mahal.
- **Jantar Mantar**: A UNESCO-listed astronomical observatory with massive stone instruments.

The city pulses with festivals like Diwali and Teej, traditional folk music, and vibrant street food scenes. Whether exploring its forts by day or savoring kebabs at night, Jaipur offers an immersive dive into India's regal past and colorful present.
