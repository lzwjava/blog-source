Here’s a breakdown of how **DeepWiki** works in **Devin**, based on available documentation. If you want, I can also walk through an example to make it clearer.

## What is DeepWiki in Devin

DeepWiki is a component of Devin (by Cognition Labs) that automatically generates documentation-like “wikis” for code repositories, especially GitHub repos. It helps developers understand unfamiliar codebases quickly by producing summaries, architecture diagrams, source-code links, etc. ([docs.devin.ai][1])

Key things it provides:

* Overviews and summaries of what the repository is about. ([MarkTechPost][2])
* Technology / dependency stack, important modules/functions. ([Medium][3])
* Diagrams: architecture, dependency graphs, showing how modules relate. ([Medium][3])
* Search / Q\&A: you can ask questions about specific parts of the codebase and get context-aware answers. ([Medium][3])

## How it is built / what makes it work under the hood

Here are the technical pieces and workflow, as described in the docs:

1. **Indexing Repositories**

   When you connect a repo (during “onboarding” or by visiting DeepWiki for a public GitHub repo), the system indexes the repo. It looks at folder structure, files, configuration files (e.g. README, package files), source code, etc. ([docs.devin.ai][1])

2. **Automatic Generation**

   From the indexed data, DeepWiki generates:

   * Summaries and descriptions of parts of the code
   * Architecture diagrams (showing how modules/folders/classes interact) ([MarkTechPost][2])
   * Documentation pages (wiki-style), possibly with hierarchical structure (“pages” with “parent” pages, etc.) ([docs.devin.ai][1])

3. **Configuration / Steering**

   If you want more control over what is documented, you can add a `.devin/wiki.json` in the root of the repository. That file lets you provide:

   * `repo_notes`: guidance/notes to steer what the auto-documentation should focus on. ([docs.devin.ai][1])
   * `pages`: specific pages (titles, purposes, parent relationships) you want created. If you use `pages`, then only those pages are generated. ([docs.devin.ai][1])

4. **Validation and Limits**

   There are limits on how much you can steer with `wiki.json`:

   * Max number of pages (\~30) ([docs.devin.ai][1])
   * Notes size, etc. ([docs.devin.ai][1])

5. **Interaction / Usage**

   Once generated, DeepWiki integrates in the Devin interface (sidebar, etc.), so:

   * You can browse the generated wiki structure. ([docs.devin.ai][1])
   * You can use “Ask Devin” or Q\&A about the codebase, which leverages the information in the wiki. ([docs.devin.ai][1])

6. **Public vs Private Repos**

   For public GitHub repos, DeepWiki is freely available; it can index them automatically. For private repos or enterprise use, there are authentication / permission considerations. ([MarkTechPost][2])

---

## Why it’s useful

* Speeds up onboarding and understanding of large or poorly-documented codebases.
* Helps find the high-level structure without manually reading through every file.
* Acts as searchable documentation + natural-language query interface.
* Lets teams focus documentation on what matters via configuration.

If you like, I can show you how DeepWiki would handle a specific repo (e.g. one you pick), or I can simplify this into the steps you’d take to use it. Do you want that?
