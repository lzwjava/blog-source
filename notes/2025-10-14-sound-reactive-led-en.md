### Simple Music Reactive LED Circuit on Breadboard

It sounds like you're remembering a cool sound-reactive LED project from 2021—basically, a circuit where LEDs pulse or "dance" to the beat of music, detected via a microphone or audio input. The "bubble lights" are likely just colorful LEDs on the breadboard, and the "volume down" part might refer to adjusting sensitivity or using a potentiometer to control the LED brightness/response.

For a super simple version (no microcontroller needed, just basic components), you can build one that lights up multiple LEDs in rhythm with nearby music or sound. This uses an electret microphone (often listed as a "speaker" in basic tutorials, but it acts as a mic here) to pick up audio, some diodes for signal processing, and transistors implicitly through the zeners for driving the LEDs. It's breadboard-friendly and costs under $10 in parts.

#### Hardware Components Needed
Here's a minimal list for 6 LEDs (scale down if you want fewer):

| Component       | Value/Spec      | Quantity |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Resistor       | 56Ω            | 6       |
| Capacitor      | 470µF          | 2       |
| Diode          | 1N4007 (or similar) | 2     |
| Zener Diode    | 1N4148         | 5       |
| Electret Microphone (small speaker/mic) | 8Ω, 0.5W | 1     |
| LED            | Any color, 5mm | 6       |
| Breadboard     | Standard size  | 1       |
| Jumper Wires   | Male-male      | ~20     |
| Power Supply   | 9V battery or 5-12V adapter | 1    |

Optional for "volume control": Add a 10kΩ potentiometer in series with the mic to adjust sensitivity (like turning down the "volume" of the input signal).

#### Quick Build Overview
1. **Setup the Mic Input**: Connect the microphone between power and ground via a capacitor (for AC audio signal). This picks up sound vibrations and converts them to electrical pulses.
2. **Signal Processing**: Use the diodes and zener diodes in a rectifier/filter setup to convert the audio waveform into pulses that trigger the LEDs at different intensities based on volume/beat strength. The zeners protect against voltage spikes.
3. **LED Driving**: Wire each LED in parallel with a 56Ω resistor to limit current. Connect the processed signal to the LED anodes—louder bass or beats will make them flicker brighter/faster.
4. **Power It Up**: Hook to 9V. Play music nearby (phone speaker works), and the LEDs should sync to the rhythm. The capacitors smooth the signal for a "dancing" effect.
5. **Breadboard Tips**: Place the mic on one side, diodes/caps in the middle, LEDs in a row on the other. Test with a multimeter for continuity before powering on.

This creates that hypnotic light show without fancy parts. If you want to add a pot for volume adjustment, just inline it on the mic signal line—it'll dial down the LED response like you mentioned.
