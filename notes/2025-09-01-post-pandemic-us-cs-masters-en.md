## Context & Motivation

* 21Fall cycle was uniquely hard: COVID-19 campus closures, visa suspensions (e.g., Proclamation 10043), travel bans/NIE rules, and U.S.–China tensions.
* Article assumes you already decided on a U.S. CS master and hold TOEFL & GRE scores.

## Country & Program Choices

* Country pros/cons (author’s take):

  * **U.S.** best CS hiring (NYC/Silicon Valley) but highest cost.
  * **UK/HK** weigh undergrad pedigree (985/211 bias).
  * **EU/Japan** may require extra language exams.
  * **Canada/Singapore/Australia** solid but weaker CS job market vs U.S.
* Program types:

  * **Course-based vs Research-based**; only **MS with thesis** cleanly targets PhD.
  * **Terminal** (e.g., MCS/MEng) typically not PhD-feeder; **MS without thesis** often can transition to PhD.
* Internships matter: programs offering **CPT** provide crucial hiring on-ramps.

## Applicant Profile & Materials

* Author: non-985 undergrad, TOEFL \~98+, GRE \~320+3, GPA \~3.82/4 (major 3.9).
* **GPA**: aim high; consider **WES** evaluation where accepted (excludes politics/PE courses → often higher converted GPA).
* **TOEFL/GRE**: finish early to avoid delaying applications.
* **Soft background**: research, competitions, exchanges, big-tech internships; **summer research** can yield strong faculty recommendations.
* **Essays**: tailor “Why school/program/track”; diversity essays need real alignment with school values (not stats).
* **Recommendations**: prefer 2 academic + 1 industry; watch anti-fraud (IP, file metadata, upload patterns).

## Application Strategy

* **Tiers** from “lottery” (Stanford/MIT/CMU/UC Berkeley/Princeton) down to Tier 3.
* **Deadlines**: rolling rounds fill fast—submit **R1** for target and even safeties.
* Expect interviews (live/Kira) and occasional coding tests.

## I-20 & Funding

* Prepare financial proof early.
* Avoid “self-funding” unless you can show **full program cost**; **parental sponsorship** is simpler and safer.

## Visas (F-1) in the COVID Era

* Embassy closures led many to **Singapore “third-country”** routing (ATP, insurance, PCR, quarantine hotels, local fee payment).
* Once China reopened slots, many switched back (CGI account transfers, long call waits).
* **First attempt**: refused under **214(b)** (strong immigration intent signals: self-funding, years of work, traveling with partner).
* **Second attempt**: removed risk factors (no dependent, parental funds), resulted in **administrative processing** then **issued**.

## Pre-Departure Logistics

* Health certificates (“yellow/red books”), vaccines (school-required + COVID), consider dental work **before** departure, spare glasses, timed PCRs, customs forms.

## Pandemic-Driven Shifts

* Massive **application surge** (50%+ in places), slower staff responses (WFH), later decision releases; some schools dropped GRE temporarily → more volume and competition.

## Outcomes & Costs

* **Admits** include CMU (MSSE, MSE SCS), Columbia MSCS, UChicago MPCS, USC (multiple), Rice MCS, WUSTL MSCS, NEU COE, Tufts, UTD.
* **Rejections** include CMU MCDS/MITS, Cornell Tech MEng, GaTech MSCS, NYU Tandon, UCSD CSE, Stanford, UoT MScAC, etc.
* Rough application spend: \~23 programs ≈ **\$3,151** (fees + score reports; extra certification fees possible).

## Key Lessons

* Front-load tests and submit **early**.
* Pick programs with **CPT** if aiming to work in the U.S.
* Optimize **funding narrative** and ties to home for visa.
* Customize essays deeply; secure **strong, authentic** recommendations.
* Expect volatility (policy changes, delays); build plan B/C (countries, terms).
