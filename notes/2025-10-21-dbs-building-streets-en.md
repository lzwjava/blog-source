The DBS Building, officially part of the Marina Bay Financial Centre (MBFC) Tower 3 at 12 Marina Boulevard, Singapore 018982, is located in the heart of the Marina Bay financial district. This area is a modern reclaimed land zone with a mix of boulevards, expressways, and secondary roads connecting to the Central Business District.

### Key Nearby Streets and Roads
Here's a summary of the major streets immediately surrounding the building (within ~500 meters), based on its position along the waterfront:

- **Marina Boulevard**: The primary south-facing road directly in front of the building, running east-west along the Marina Bay waterfront. It's a major arterial road connecting to Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE).
- **Central Boulevard**: To the east, a short connector road linking to Shenton Way and the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE). It's about 100-200 meters away.
- **Straits View**: To the north, a north-south road parallel to the Singapore River, leading toward Clarke Quay and the Esplanade. Roughly 200-300 meters north.
- **Raffles Quay**: To the west, another key waterfront road running parallel to Marina Boulevard, connecting to Collyer Quay and the financial core. About 300 meters away.
- **Robinson Road**: Slightly further west (~400 meters), a major east-west thoroughfare in the CBD, often used for access to the area.
- **Bayfront Avenue**: To the southeast (~300 meters), a scenic promenade road linking to Marina Bay Sands and the bayfront attractions.

The layout forms a grid-like pattern with the MBFC complex at the intersection of Marina Boulevard and Straits View/Central Boulevard. Pedestrian paths, including underground linkways to Downtown MRT Station (DT17), make it highly walkable. For navigation, use apps like Google Maps or OneMap for real-time details.
