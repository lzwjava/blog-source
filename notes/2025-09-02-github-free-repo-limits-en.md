A free GitHub user can create **unlimited private repositories**, but there’s a restriction on **collaborators**.

* You can have as many private repos as you want.
* Each private repo can have up to **3 collaborators** (people you invite to work with you).

If you need more collaborators, you’d need to upgrade to a paid plan (GitHub Pro, Team, or Enterprise).

Do you also want me to explain how this changed from the older GitHub policy (before 2019, when free users couldn’t have private repos at all)?
