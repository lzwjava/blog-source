In hairdressing, *“oxidant color 3%”* usually refers to a **developer/oxidizing lotion** with a hydrogen peroxide concentration of **3% (10 volume)**.

### What it is

* It’s basically **hydrogen peroxide** diluted to 3%.
* In the salon context, developers (oxidants) come in different strengths: 3% (10 vol), 6% (20 vol), 9% (30 vol), 12% (40 vol).
* They’re mixed with permanent hair dye or bleach. The peroxide opens the hair cuticle and reacts with the color molecules inside the cortex.

### What 3% specifically does

* **Gentle developer**: 3% is the lowest commonly used concentration.
* Typically used for:

  * Depositing color without lightening (darker shades, toners).
  * Covering hair slightly, refreshing color, or when minimal lift is needed.
  * More protective for fragile or damaged hair.

### Difference to hydrogen peroxide (general)

* Hydrogen peroxide is the *pure chemical compound* (H₂O₂), available in different strengths (from 3% in pharmacies up to 35%+ in industrial/lab use).
* “Oxidant 3%” is a **cosmetic-grade hydrogen peroxide developer** standardized for hair use, usually stabilized with buffers and conditioners to keep it safe and consistent.
* In short: oxidant = hydrogen peroxide solution, formulated for hair dyeing.
* The difference is **context and formulation**:

  * Hydrogen peroxide: raw chemical, many uses (antiseptic, bleaching, cleaning).
  * Oxidant 3%: salon product, controlled stability, meant to be mixed with hair color.

Would you like me to also explain the difference between 3%, 6%, 9%, and 12% oxidants, and how stylists choose among them?
