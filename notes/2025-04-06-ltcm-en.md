Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a highly leveraged hedge fund founded in 1994 by John Meriwether, a former vice-chairman and head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers. The fund's partners included several prominent figures, most notably Myron Scholes and Robert Merton, who later won the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics for their work on option pricing theory.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of LTCM and its collapse:

**Investment Strategy:**

* **Convergence Trading/Arbitrage:** LTCM's core strategy revolved around identifying and exploiting small, temporary price discrepancies between related securities. They believed that in the long run, these prices would converge to their "fair" values, allowing them to profit from the difference.
* **High Leverage:** To amplify these small potential profits, LTCM employed an enormous amount of leverage. They borrowed heavily to finance their positions, meaning they controlled assets worth many times their initial capital. Some estimates suggest their leverage reached over 100 to 1.
* **Sophisticated Mathematical Models:** The fund relied heavily on complex mathematical models and algorithms to identify trading opportunities and manage risk. These models were based on historical data and statistical relationships.
* **Diverse Positions:** LTCM held a vast array of positions across various asset classes, including government bonds, corporate bonds, emerging market debt, interest rate swaps, and equity options. The idea was that diversification would reduce overall risk.

**The Collapse of LTCM:**

* **Initial Success:** LTCM initially achieved remarkable success, delivering high returns to its investors in its first few years. This attracted more capital and further boosted its reputation.
* **The Asian Financial Crisis (1997) and Russian Financial Crisis (1998):** In 1997, the Asian financial crisis began to create market turmoil. This was followed by the Russian financial crisis in August 1998, when Russia devalued the ruble and defaulted on its debt.
* **"Flight to Quality":** These crises triggered a "flight to quality," as investors rushed to sell risky assets and buy safe, liquid ones like U.S. Treasury bonds. This caused many of the price discrepancies that LTCM was betting on to widen dramatically instead of converging.
* **Massive Losses:** As their positions moved against them, LTCM faced massive losses. Due to their high leverage, even relatively small price movements resulted in huge declines in their capital.
* **Margin Calls:** As losses mounted, LTCM's lenders issued margin calls, demanding that the fund put up more collateral to cover their borrowed positions. This forced LTCM to sell assets, often at unfavorable prices, further exacerbating their losses and putting downward pressure on the market.
* **Systemic Risk:** The sheer size and interconnectedness of LTCM's positions posed a significant risk to the global financial system. If LTCM had collapsed and been forced to liquidate its vast portfolio in a disorderly manner, it could have triggered a chain reaction of defaults and failures among its counterparties (the banks and other institutions it traded with). This could have led to a widespread financial crisis.

**Berkshire Hathaway's Involvement in the Potential Bailout:**

* **Federal Reserve Intervention:** Recognizing the systemic risk, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York stepped in to organize a private bailout of LTCM. They brought together representatives from several major banks and financial institutions that had significant exposure to LTCM.
* **Warren Buffett's Offer:** Amid these discussions, Warren Buffett, along with Berkshire Hathaway, insurance giant AIG, and Goldman Sachs, made an independent offer to buy out LTCM's partners for $250 million and inject $3.75 billion of capital into the fund. Their offer came with a very short deadline.
* **Offer Rejected:** The partners of LTCM ultimately rejected Buffett's offer. They reportedly found the terms unfavorable and believed they could work out a better deal with the consortium of banks organized by the Federal Reserve.
* **Consortium Bailout:** Ultimately, a consortium of 14 banks agreed to inject $3.625 billion into LTCM in exchange for a 90% stake in the fund and greater control over its operations. This bailout prevented an immediate collapse and allowed for a more orderly liquidation of LTCM's assets over time.

**Buffett's Lesson:**

In his speech, Buffett used the LTCM saga as a cautionary tale to illustrate the dangers of:

* **Excessive Leverage:** Even highly intelligent people can be undone by too much borrowing.
* **Relying Solely on Models:** Mathematical models, while useful, are based on historical data and may not account for unforeseen events or extreme market conditions.
* **Risking What You Need for What You Don't:** LTCM's partners, already wealthy, risked the stability of the financial system (and their own remaining capital) in pursuit of even greater gains.

Buffett's recounting of Berkshire's involvement highlights his opportunistic approach to investing, his ability to quickly assess complex situations, and his willingness to act decisively when he sees an opportunity arising from the mistakes of others. He also implicitly criticized the hubris of LTCM's principals who, despite their intelligence, made decisions that nearly led to a financial catastrophe.
