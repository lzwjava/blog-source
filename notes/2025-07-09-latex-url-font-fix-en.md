It looks like you are encountering an issue with `latex` or `xelatex`, specifically related to undefined characters while formatting URLs. This type of error usually occurs when there’s an issue with a package or font configuration in your LaTeX setup. You also mentioned you're trying to stop the process but have been unable to do so with `Ctrl + C` or `Ctrl + D`. Here’s how you can address both issues:

### **Stopping the Process (When Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D Don’t Work)**

1. **Use `Ctrl + Z` (Suspend the Process)**:

   * This command suspends the process and allows you to return to the terminal prompt without closing it.
   * After that, you can use `kill` to terminate the process if necessary.

2. **Find the Process and Kill It**:

   * Open a new terminal window and find the process ID (PID) of the LaTeX process using the command:

     ```
     ps aux | grep latex
     ```
   * Once you find the PID, use the `kill` command to terminate the process:

     ```
     kill -9 <PID>
     ```

### **Fixing the LaTeX Errors**

The specific error you're encountering (`\textfont 0 is undefined`) usually happens when there’s an issue with how URLs are formatted or a problem with the font being used. Here are some steps to fix it:

1. **Ensure `hyperref` Package is Correctly Used**:
   If you are using `\url{}`, make sure that you have included the `hyperref` package correctly in your LaTeX document:

   ```latex
   \usepackage{hyperref}
   ```

2. **Use `\url{}` Properly**:
   Make sure that you are using the correct syntax for URLs:

   ```latex
   \url{https://example.com}
   ```

   Avoid any special characters in URLs that might need to be escaped.

3. **Font Configuration**:
   The error message regarding undefined characters might be due to a font issue, especially if you're using a specific font in your LaTeX configuration. If you're using a custom font, try switching to a standard font like `Latin Modern` to see if the problem persists.

   You can also force LaTeX to use a font package like:

   ```latex
   \usepackage{lmodern}  % Load Latin Modern font
   ```

4. **Ensure Your Compiler is Correct**:

   * If you're using `xelatex`, ensure that you’re compiling with the proper fonts and Unicode support.
   * If you're using `pdflatex`, try switching to `xelatex` if you are dealing with Unicode characters in the URLs or other text.

5. **Update LaTeX Packages**:
   Make sure your LaTeX distribution is up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues:

   * For **TeX Live**, run: `tlmgr update --all`
   * For **MikTeX**, run: `miktex-update`.

Try these steps and see if they fix the issue. Let me know if you need further help!
