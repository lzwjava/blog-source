Based on recent data and trends as of July 2025, there isn't strong evidence to suggest that WeChat Moments is experiencing a widespread "silencing" or significant decline in overall usage, postings, or views. WeChat as a platform continues to show user growth, with monthly active users (MAUs) reaching around 1.3 billion globally, up about 2% year-over-year. However, there are some nuances indicating subtle shifts in user behavior:

- **Overall Platform Growth**: WeChat added approximately 43 million more users in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year, and projections suggest it could reach nearly 865 million users in China alone by year-end. This growth is driven by features like Mini Programs (which hit over 800 million MAUs in May 2025) and e-commerce integrations, but Moments specifically isn't highlighted as a growth driver in most reports.

- **Time Spent and Engagement Trends**: Average daily time spent on WeChat by Chinese users has dipped slightly, from 82 minutes in 2022 to about 79 minutes in 2025. This could imply less intensive use of social features like Moments, as users gravitate toward short-form video (via WeChat Channels or competitors like Douyin/TikTok), private group chats, or community-focused interactions. Marketing analyses for 2025 emphasize a shift from broad "traffic-driven" posting to more targeted, trust-building communities, which might reduce casual Moments activity.

- **Potential for Reduced Activity in Moments**: While direct stats on Moments postings or views are scarce, anecdotal trends and expert insights point to it becoming less central. Users increasingly prefer private sharing over public feeds due to privacy concerns, ad fatigue, or competition from apps like Xiaohongshu (for lifestyle content) and TikTok. Business strategies in 2025 focus more on WeChat's e-commerce and analytics tools rather than Moments ads, suggesting the feature might be deprioritized. However, it's not "dying"—it's still used for personal updates, with about 60% of users opening WeChat 9-11 times daily, often including Moments checks.

In summary, WeChat Moments isn't dramatically silenced, but it may feel quieter for some users due to evolving preferences toward other in-app features or external platforms. If you're noticing less activity in your own circle, it could be influenced by regional factors, age demographics (younger users favor videos), or algorithm changes. For the latest user sentiments, monitoring Chinese social media or reports from Tencent (WeChat's parent) would provide more clarity.
