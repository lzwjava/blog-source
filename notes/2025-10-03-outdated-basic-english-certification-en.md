Here’s a concise translation and explanation of your statement for an English-speaking audience:

---

**"I have a Level 2 English certification, but it’s from 30 years ago in China—back then, it was considered a 'dumb' or basic level."**

### Context:
- **Level 2 English in China (30 years ago):**
  - This likely refers to a **basic or entry-level English proficiency test**, such as the **Public English Test System (PETS) Level 2** or a local/regional exam.
  - At the time, English education was less widespread, and passing Level 2 might have been seen as a minimal or "beginner" achievement—hence the self-deprecating term "dumb level."

- **Comparison to today:**
  - Modern English proficiency tests (e.g., **CET-4/6, IELTS, TOEFL**) are more rigorous and globally recognized.
  - A Level 2 from 30 years ago would roughly equate to **high school-level English or below CET-4** today.
