title: How to Find or Create Java Agent JAR
translated: false
---

The `/path/to/java-agent.jar` in your code is just a placeholder — there’s no official, universal "Java Agent" JAR you can download that contains `com.example.Agent`.

Where you get the actual JAR depends entirely on **what Java agent you want to connect to**:

---

**1. If this is your own Java agent**

* You need to **write and build** it in Java.
* Create a Java project with the package `com.example` and a class `Agent` that implements `getJVMInfo()`, `getMemoryUsage()`, and `getThreadInfo()`.
* Compile it and package it into a JAR with something like Maven or Gradle.
* Example Maven command:

  ```bash
  mvn clean package
  ```

  After build, you’ll find `java-agent.jar` in the `target/` directory.

---

**2. If it’s part of a specific monitoring/profiling tool**

* Tools like **VisualVM**, **Java Mission Control**, **YourKit**, or **New Relic** have their own agent JARs.
* You’ll need to download that tool’s package from its website and look for the agent JAR inside its `lib` or `agent` folder.
* For example, YourKit’s agent is often named something like `yjpagent.jar`.

---

**3. If it’s from a GitHub or open-source project**

* Search for the project repository that defines `com.example.Agent`.
* Clone the repo and build it into a JAR.
* Example:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/java-agent.git
  cd java-agent
  mvn package
  ```

---

**4. If you just want to test your Python–Java JPype connection**

* You can create a minimal Java agent class yourself and compile it:

  ```java
  package com.example;

  public class Agent {
      public String getJVMInfo() {
          return System.getProperty("java.version");
      }
      public String getMemoryUsage() {
          return Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory() + " free / " +
                 Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() + " total";
      }
      public String getThreadInfo() {
          return Thread.activeCount() + " active threads";
      }
  }
  ```

  Then compile and JAR it:

  ```bash
  javac com/example/Agent.java
  jar cf java-agent.jar com/example/Agent.class
  ```

---

If you want, I can **write you a working Java agent source code** that exactly matches the Python interface you wrote, so you can compile it into `java-agent.jar` and run your script immediately. Would you like me to prepare that?
