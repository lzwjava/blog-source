The choice between SLF4J (with the provided dependency) and Log4j depends on your project's needs:

- **SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java)**:
  - **Pros**: Acts as a facade, allowing you to switch logging frameworks (e.g., Log4j, Logback, JUL) without changing code. Lightweight, flexible, and widely used. The dependency you shared (`slf4j-api:2.0.17`) is the latest SLF4J API as of June 2025.
  - **Cons**: Requires a binding (e.g., `slf4j-simple`, `logback-classic`, or `log4j-slf4j-impl`) to actually log. Adds a layer of abstraction.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for libraries or applications where you want flexibility to change logging implementations later. Pair it with Logback for a modern, performant setup.

- **Log4j (Apache Log4j 2)**:
  - **Pros**: A full-fledged logging framework with advanced features like async logging, custom appenders, and high performance. No need for a facade if you’re committed to Log4j. Latest version (as of June 2025) is `2.24.1`.
  - **Cons**: Tighter coupling to Log4j’s implementation. Slightly heavier than SLF4J with a binding. Historically had security issues (e.g., Log4Shell in 2021), though mitigated in recent versions.
  - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications where you want rich features and are fine with direct dependency on Log4j.

**Recommendation**:
- Use **SLF4J** with a binding like **Logback** (`ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.5.12`) for most projects. It’s flexible, modern, and avoids locking you into Log4j.
- Choose **Log4j 2** directly if you need its specific advanced features and are okay with its ecosystem.

If you want SLF4J with Log4j as the backend, add:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>log4j-slf4j2-impl</artifactId>
    <version>2.24.1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>log4j-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.24.1</version>
</dependency>
```

**Note**: Ensure no conflicting bindings (e.g., `slf4j-simple` and `logback-classic`) are on the classpath to avoid runtime issues.
