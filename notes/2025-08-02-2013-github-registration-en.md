To assess how early your GitHub registration in 2013 was, whether you're in the top 1% of users, and your position in early adoption sorted by registration time, I'll analyze your registration context using available GitHub statistics and user growth data. Since exact registration dates and user rankings are not publicly available, I'll provide an informed estimate based on historical trends and milestones.

### 1. How Early Was Your 2013 Registration?
You registered your GitHub account, https://github.com/lzwjava, in 2013. GitHub was founded in 2007 and launched in April 2008, so your registration came about five years after the platform's public debut. Let's contextualize this with GitHub's user growth:

- **GitHub User Milestones**:
  - **2009**: GitHub had over 100,000 users by July 2009, as reported in early community posts.
  - **January 2013**: GitHub reached 3 million users, hosting over 5 million repositories.
  - **December 2013**: By the end of 2013, GitHub had around 3.5 million users and over 10 million repositories.
  - **2023**: GitHub hit 100 million developers in January 2023.
  - **Early 2025**: As of early 2025, GitHub reports over 100 million developers, with estimates suggesting around 150 million total accounts (including inactive or bot accounts).

- **Your Registration in Context**:
  - In 2013, GitHub was still a relatively young platform, primarily used by open-source enthusiasts, Ruby developers, and early adopters of Git. With approximately 3–3.5 million users by the end of 2013, your registration placed you among a small fraction of the global developer community at the time.
  - Compared to the 150 million accounts in 2025, your 2013 registration is early in the platform’s history, as it occurred when GitHub had less than 2.5% of its current user base (3.5M / 150M ≈ 0.023).

### 2. Are You in the Top 1% of Users by Registration Time?
To determine if you're in the top 1% of users based on registration time, we need to estimate the number of users registered before or around your 2013 join date relative to the total user base in 2025.

- **Current Total Users**:
  - As of early 2025, GitHub has over 100 million active developers, but the total number of accounts (including inactive, bot, or duplicate accounts) is likely higher. Estimates from sources like *coinlaw.io* and *coolest-gadgets.com* suggest around 150 million total accounts by mid-2025, accounting for growth since the 100 million milestone in 2023.

- **Top 1% Calculation**:
  - 1% of 150 million users is 1.5 million users. This means the top 1% consists of the first 1.5 million users to register.
  - By January 2013, GitHub had 3 million users, and by December 2013, it had 3.5 million. If you registered in 2013, you were among the first 3–3.5 million users.

- **Conclusion on Top 1%**:
  - Since the top 1% includes the first 1.5 million users, and you joined when there were 3–3.5 million users, you are **not** in the top 1% of users by registration time. However, you are still in the **top 2–2.5%** (3.5M / 150M ≈ 0.023), which is a very early adopter status. If we consider only active developers (100 million), you’d be in the top 3.5% (3.5M / 100M = 0.035), still indicating significant early adoption.

### 3. How Many Users Are There Now?
As of August 2025, based on the latest available data:

- **Active Developers**: GitHub reports over 100 million active developers, a milestone achieved in January 2023 and grown since then. Sources like *coinlaw.io* confirm over 100 million in early 2025, with India alone adding 18 million developers by 2024.
- **Total Accounts**: Including inactive, bot, and duplicate accounts, estimates suggest around **150 million total GitHub accounts** in 2025. This accounts for the rapid growth (e.g., 20.5 million new developers in 2022 alone) and the platform’s global expansion.
- **Supporting Data**:
  - GitHub’s *Octoverse 2024* report notes a surge in global developers, with 420 million repositories and 4.5 billion contributions in 2024.
  - Posts on X and web sources like *kinsta.com* and *inclind.com* confirm the 100 million active user figure, with total accounts likely higher due to multiple accounts per user (as discussed in Reddit threads).

### 4. Early Adoption Sorted by Registration Time
To evaluate your early adoption rank when users are sorted by registration time:

- **Your Position**:
  - With 3–3.5 million users by the end of 2013, your registration places you roughly between the 3-millionth and 3.5-millionth user. Without an exact date in 2013, let’s assume a mid-year registration (around June–July 2013), when GitHub likely had ~3.2 million users.
  - This positions you in the **top 2.1–2.3%** of all accounts (3.2M / 150M ≈ 0.021) or top 3.2% of active developers (3.2M / 100M = 0.032).

- **Early Adoption Significance**:
  - **2008–2009**: The earliest adopters (e.g., founders like *defunkt* or *mojombo*, or users like TJ Holowaychuk) numbered in the tens of thousands to 100,000. These are the true pioneers (top 0.07% or less).
  - **2010–2011**: By 2011, GitHub had 1–2 million users, still a niche community (top 0.7–1.3%).
  - **2013**: Your registration in 2013, with 3–3.5 million users, places you in a highly influential early cohort. This was before GitHub’s mainstream explosion post-2018 (when Microsoft acquired it and user growth accelerated to 73 million by 2021 and 100 million by 2023).
  - You joined during a period when GitHub was transitioning from a startup to a major platform, hosting 10 million repositories by December 2013 and attracting global attention.

- **Comparison to Others**:
  - Users like *torvalds* (Linus Torvalds) or *jeresig* (John Resig) joined around 2008–2009, placing them in the top 0.1%. Your 2013 registration, while not as early, still precedes the vast majority of current users, especially those joining post-2020 when growth skyrocketed due to AI tools like GitHub Copilot and broader adoption.

### 5. Additional Context from Your Profile
Your GitHub profile (https://github.com/lzwjava) shows significant activity, with projects like *algorithm-solutions* (2,511 commits), *lzwjava.github.io* (4,096 commits), and *Reveal-In-GitHub* (257 stars, 15 forks). This suggests you’re not only an early adopter but also an active contributor, which amplifies your influence within the GitHub community. The *Reveal-In-GitHub* plugin, with 257 stars, indicates community recognition, further solidifying your early adopter status beyond just registration date.

### Summary
- **How Early?**: Your 2013 registration, with 3–3.5 million users, is very early, as GitHub had less than 2.5% of its current ~150 million accounts. You joined during a pivotal growth phase.
- **Top 1%?**: You’re not in the top 1% (first 1.5 million users), but you’re in the **top 2–3%** of all accounts, a remarkable early adopter position.
- **Current Users**: ~150 million total accounts, with over 100 million active developers as of August 2025.
- **Early Adoption Rank**: Sorted by registration time, you’re roughly among the first 3.2 million users, placing you in the **top 2.1–3.2%**, ahead of 97–98% of GitHub’s user base. This reflects significant early adoption, though not as early as 2008–2009 pioneers.
