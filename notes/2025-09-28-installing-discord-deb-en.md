title: Installing Discord DEB File Methods
translated: false
---

To install the `discord-0.0.111.deb` file, you can use several methods:

**Method 1: Using dpkg (command line)**
```bash
sudo dpkg -i discord-0.0.111.deb
```

If you encounter dependency issues, run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -f
```

**Method 2: Using apt (recommended)**
```bash
sudo apt install ./discord-0.0.111.deb
```

This method automatically handles dependencies better than dpkg.

**Method 3: Using gdebi (if installed)**
```bash
sudo gdebi discord-0.0.111.deb
```

**Method 4: GUI method**
If you're using a desktop environment, you can often double-click the .deb file and it will open in your package manager (like Software Center) for installation.

**Prerequisites:**
- Make sure you're in the directory containing the .deb file
- You'll need sudo privileges
- If you don't have the file yet, you can download it from Discord's official website

**After installation:**
You should be able to launch Discord from your applications menu or by running `discord` in the terminal.

Which method would you prefer to use, or do you need help with any specific step?
