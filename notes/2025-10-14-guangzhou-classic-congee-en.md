### Typical Congee (Porridge) in Guangzhou

Guangzhou, in Guangdong province, is famous for its Cantonese-style congee (known as *zhou* in Mandarin or *jook* in Cantonese), a creamy rice porridge that's a go-to for breakfast, late-night snacks, or comfort food. It's usually made by simmering rice in a large amount of water or broth until it breaks down into a silky texture, then topped with savory ingredients. Congee is light, warming, and versatile—perfect for the humid subtropical climate. You'll find it at street stalls, dim sum spots, or specialized porridge shops, often paired with youtiao (fried dough sticks) or pickled veggies.

Here are some of the most typical varieties, including the ones you mentioned:

#### Seafood Congee (*Hoi Sin Zhou*)
This is one of Guangzhou's stars, especially the claypot version cooked over high heat for a smoky flavor. It's loaded with fresh seafood like sand shrimp, mud crab, clams, squid, and sometimes dried elements like scallops. The broth absorbs the ocean flavors, making it rich yet not heavy. It's a popular midnight snack—vendors serve it steaming hot from big pots. Originating from Chaozhou influences, it's common at places like Xin Wen Ji on Panfu Road.

#### Pig Organ Congee (*Zha Za Zhou* or Pig Miscellaneous Porridge)
I believe "pig za zhuza porridge" refers to *zha za zhou* (literally "mixed pig bits congee"), a hearty local favorite using offal like pig intestines, liver, kidney, and blood cake. The organs are sliced thin, blanched for tenderness, and simmered in the porridge for a savory, slightly chewy contrast to the smooth rice. It's nutritious (high in iron) and affordable, often eaten at night markets or hidden stalls that draw long lines—some open only a few hours a week. Spots like Liuhua Porridge City or viral Guangdong shops specialize in it.

#### Other Common Types
- **Sampan Congee (*Ting Zai Zhou*)**: A Guangzhou original from Pearl River boat vendors. It's a lighter seafood-pork mix with fried peanuts, scaly fish fillets, crispy dough fritters, and roasted duck bits for crunch. Now served in boat-shaped bowls at restaurants.
- **Century Egg Congee (*Pi Dan Zhou*)**: Plain porridge topped with preserved duck eggs (dark and jelly-like), lean pork, and ginger—simple and iconic for breakfast.
- **Chicken Congee (*Gai Ji Zhou*)**: Broth-based with shredded chicken, ginger, and scallions; soothing for hangovers or colds.
- **Lean Meat Congee (*Shao Rou Zhou*)**: Minced pork with preserved veggies; everyday comfort.

If you're visiting, head to areas like Liwan District or Yuexiu for authentic spots. Congee culture here is all about freshness and balance—sweet, salty, crunchy textures in every bowl.
