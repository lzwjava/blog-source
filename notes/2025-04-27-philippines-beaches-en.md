The Philippines is *famous* for having some of the most beautiful beaches in the world! 🏝️ Here are some of the truly great ones:

---

### 1. **White Beach – Boracay** (Aklan, Visayas)
- World-famous for its powdery white sand and stunning sunsets.
- The beach is divided into Stations 1, 2, and 3 — each with a different vibe (luxury, party, and chill).
- After a major rehabilitation, it’s cleaner and more beautiful than ever.

### 2. **El Nido Beaches – Palawan**
- Think dramatic limestone cliffs, hidden lagoons, and crystal-clear waters.
- **Nacpan Beach** is particularly stunning, and **Seven Commandos Beach** is a secret paradise.
- Perfect for island hopping and snorkeling.

### 3. **Alona Beach – Panglao Island** (Bohol)
- White sand, vibrant marine life, and easy access to diving spots like Balicasag Island.
- It’s lively at night with bars and restaurants but still peaceful compared to Boracay.

### 4. **Saud Beach – Pagudpud** (Ilocos Norte, Luzon)
- Sometimes called the "Boracay of the North."
- Wide shores, gentle waves, and very peaceful — ideal for those seeking a less commercialized beach.

### 5. **Malapascua Island Beaches** (Cebu)
- Known for great diving, especially for seeing thresher sharks.
- The beaches are quiet, with fine white sand and small resorts.

### 6. **Kalanggaman Island** (Leyte)
- Famous for its long, narrow **sandbar** stretching into turquoise waters.
- Great for day trips, swimming, snorkeling, and photography.

### 7. **Siargao Beaches** (Surigao del Norte)
- **Cloud 9** is famous for surfing, but Siargao also has beautiful, uncrowded beaches like **Daku Island**, **Guyam Island**, and **Sugba Lagoon**.
- Chill surfer vibes everywhere.

### 8. **Camiguin White Island** (Camiguin)
- A small, uninhabited sandbar with gorgeous views of Camiguin’s volcanoes.
- It's perfect for swimming and relaxing.

### 9. **Subic Beach – Sorsogon** (Luzon)
- Known for its pinkish-white sand (caused by crushed red corals).
- Very serene and far from crowds.

### 10. **Samal Island Beaches** (Davao del Norte, Mindanao)
- Resorts like Pearl Farm Beach Resort are famous for luxury, but there are also plenty of budget options.
- Easy to access from Davao City.

Each beach has a slightly different character — some are lively and festive, others feel like private paradises.
