title: XRP Has Lowest Transaction Fees

To determine which cryptocurrency among Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) has the lowest fees for transactions initiated from a Localcoin ATM in Hong Kong, we need to consider **blockchain transaction fees** (not ATM fees, which are 5-8% for all coins at Localcoin ATMs). Fees vary based on network congestion, transaction complexity, and market conditions, but below are typical values as of 2025, based on current blockchain data.

### Transaction Fee Comparison

| Cryptocurrency | Typical Transaction Fee (USD) | Notes |
|---------------|------------------------------|-------|
| **XRP**       | ~$0.0002 - $0.001           | Lowest fees; fixed low cost for transfers due to XRP Ledger's design for fast, cheap payments. |
| **LTC**       | ~$0.01 - $0.05              | Very low; designed for cheaper transactions than BTC. Fees rise slightly during network spikes. |
| **ETH**       | ~$0.50 - $2.00              | Post-Dencun upgrade (2024), base fees dropped, but complex transactions (e.g., DeFi) can cost more. Layer 2 solutions (e.g., Arbitrum) can reduce to ~$0.10. |
| **BTC**       | ~$1.00 - $5.00              | Highest; fees depend on mempool size and priority. Lightning Network can lower costs (~$0.01) but isn’t typical for ATM sends. |

### Key Points
- **XRP has the lowest fees**, often fractions of a cent, making it ideal for cost-conscious transfers.
- **LTC** is a close second, with fees typically under $0.05, great for everyday use.
- **ETH** fees are moderate but can spike for complex transactions or during network congestion.
- **BTC** has the highest fees, especially during peak times, due to limited block space.

### ATM Context
When using a Localcoin ATM, the purchase process (cash to crypto) incurs a 5-8% fee regardless of the coin. The blockchain fee only matters when you *send* the crypto from your wallet post-purchase. For example:
- Buying $100 of XRP: ~$5-8 ATM fee + ~$0.0002 to send later.
- Buying $100 of BTC: ~$5-8 ATM fee + ~$1-5 to send later.

### Recommendation
**XRP** is your best bet for the lowest transaction fees after withdrawing from a Localcoin ATM. If you prioritize both speed (from your previous query) and low fees, XRP is the clear winner. If you need Solana (SOL, not supported by Localcoin), its fees are also very low (~$0.00025), comparable to XRP, but you’d need another platform like CoinHero or an exchange.
