title: Fixing Firefox APT Repository Error
translated: false
type: note
---

The error you're seeing is specific to the Mozilla Firefox APT repository (`https://packages.mozilla.org/apt`), where the fetch for the `binary-all/Packages` index file fails with a 400 Bad Request. This is a known intermittent issue reported by other Ubuntu/Debian users, often tied to proxy configurations (your local proxy at `127.0.0.1:7890` suggests something like Clash, V2Ray, or a similar tool is in play, which can mangle HTTPS requests for APT). The good news is that APT ignores the failure and uses cached/old indexes, so system updates aren't blocked—but it can prevent getting the latest Firefox deb packages.

### Quick Fixes to Try (in order)
1. **Clear APT cache** (this resolves corrupted or stale index files, which fixed it for several users):
   ```
   sudo apt clean
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Temporarily bypass your proxy for APT** (since the 400 often stems from proxy interference with the repo's HTTPS):
   ```
   unset http_proxy https_proxy all_proxy
   sudo -E apt update
   ```
   - Run this in the same terminal session. If it works, you can make it permanent by adding the `unset` lines to your `~/.bashrc` (or just before APT commands) or disabling the proxy app briefly.
   - If your proxy is set system-wide (e.g., in `/etc/environment`), edit that file to exclude APT or comment out the lines temporarily.

3. **Disable proxy globally for APT** (if the above works but you want a set-it-and-forget-it option):
   ```
   echo 'Acquire::http::Proxy "";
   Acquire::https::Proxy "";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99no-proxy
   sudo apt update
   ```
   - This tells APT to ignore proxies entirely. Revert by deleting `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99no-proxy` if needed.

### If You Need Latest Firefox Without the Repo
If the repo keeps failing and you just want updated Firefox:
- **Switch to Snap** (Ubuntu's default, easy updates, no repo hassle):
  ```
  sudo snap install firefox
  ```
- **Or Flatpak** (if you prefer):
  ```
  sudo apt install flatpak
  flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
  flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.firefox
  ```

### Prevention/Notes
- The Mozilla repo is unofficial for getting bleeding-edge Firefox debs—consider sticking with Ubuntu's snap version unless you specifically need the deb.
- If none of this works, check your proxy logs (e.g., Clash dashboard) for rejected requests to `packages.mozilla.org`, or test without the proxy entirely.
- Run `sudo apt update` again after fixes to verify.

If these don't resolve it, share more details like your proxy setup or full `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mozilla.list` contents for deeper troubleshooting.
