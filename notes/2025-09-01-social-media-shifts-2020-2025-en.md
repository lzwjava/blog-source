You’re spot on—there’s a noticeable shift in the “social network vibe” from **2020** to **2025**, and the contrast is pretty striking.

---

## 1. 2020: Pandemic, Politics, and Polarization

* In 2020, social platforms—especially spaces like Chinese Twitter/X communities—were dominated by fierce political and COVID-19 discussions. Figures like **Dr. Li Wenliang (Yan Limeng)** and **Miles Guo (Guo Wengui)** were central to conspiracy narratives, dissent, and activism. Social media felt urgent, chaotic, and rife with global anxiety and rapid-fire information (and misinformation).

## 2. 2025: AI Everywhere—but the Mood Is Shifting

By 2025, the tone has evolved. While AI remains a dominant theme, the ways it’s showing up—and how people respond—paint a more nuanced picture.

### Generative AI & Agentic Systems

* AI has moved from experimental to deeply embedded in social media workflows. Tools now assist with caption writing, image generation, content scheduling, and even automated engagement. Most marketers see generative AI as a powerful collaborator—not a risky experiment anymore ([Hootsuite][1], [Exploding Topics][2]).
* Behind the scenes, AI agents are becoming more autonomous, performing tasks like predictive content optimization, personalized interaction, and even coding or deep research. They're rapidly evolving—from simple bots into complex, multi-modal decision-makers ([MarkTechPost][3]).
* Within platforms, social AI agents are increasingly handling real-time responses and interactions. Meta, for example, is testing AI buddies, engineering agents, and voice-driven assistants integrated into devices like its Ray-Ban smart glasses ([Financial Times][4]). However, there's also growing skepticism about AI overload. Voices are rising for more humanity in digital spaces—favoring “slow web” vibes, curated creativity, and resistance to AI-generated noise ([Axios][5]).

### Content & Community Trends

* **Content experimentation rules.** Brands are loosening consistent branding—taking creative risks, adopting distinct voices, and prioritizing entertainment, education, or raw connection over polished ads ([Hootsuite][1]).
* **Social listening & micro-virality.** Instead of chasing big viral waves, platforms emphasize listening, trend-spotting, and engaging in more pace-sensitive ways—leaning into smaller, meaningful viral moments ([Hootsuite][1]).
* **Video is still king—but evolving.** Short-form formats like TikTok, Reels, and Shorts remain influential, but long-form content has made a comeback, offering more narrative depth and nuance ([Sprout Social][6]).
* **Cultural fluency & authenticity matter.** Consumers expect brands to be culturally attuned and emotionally honest. Content that feels genuine—like user-generated stories or human-forward narratives—lands better than hard sells ([Sprout Social][6], [Exploding Topics][2], [Later][7]).
* **Interest in niche and personalized spaces is growing.** As mainstream platforms grow oversaturated, Gen Z and Gen Alpha are exploring new, more tailored social networks. Investors are backing niche, AI-powered, community-first platforms over noisy mega sites ([businessinsider.com][8]).
* **Prosocial media on the rise.** Movements toward empathy, inclusivity, and constructive discourse are gaining traction. Platforms like Threads (via Fediverse), Community Notes (on X), and decentralized networks are emphasizing kindness and trust over clickbait conflict ([WIRED][9]).

## Summary: From Turbulent to Tool-Driven (But Tactile)

| Period   | Dominant Vibe                        | Key Themes                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2020** | Urgent, fragmented, sensational      | COVID anxieties, conspiracies, political fractures      |
| **2025** | AI-infused, experimental, reflective | Agentic automation, content creativity, real connection |

---

**In short:**

* **2020** felt frantic—conspiracies and pandemic dominated the social feed.
* **2025** is defined by technological integration—but there’s also a pushback toward authenticity, creative experimentation, and more thoughtful, community-driven interaction.
