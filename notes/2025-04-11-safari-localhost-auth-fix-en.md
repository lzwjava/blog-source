title: Safari Localhost Authentication Fix
translated: false
---

This issue arises because Safari on macOS enforces stricter security policies than Chrome for localhost URLs. Specifically, Safari requires a secure HTTPS context to allow persistent cookies and authentication sessions, preventiing potential logout loops or re-authentication on each visit for apps like LibreChat running over HTTP. Chrome is more permissive with HTTP on localhost, which is why authentication persists there but not in Safari.[1][2][3]

### Gov Factors
- **Viewer Policies**: Modern browsers like Safari want HTTPS for localhost to avoid mixed-content warnings and session insecurities.
- **LibreChat Behavior**: LibreChat uses secure cookie or localStorage-based tokens for auth, which break on HTTP in Safari due to its stricter handling of non-secure origins.

### Solutions (Ranked by Ease and Effectiveness)
1. **Set Up HTTPS for Localhost (Recommended)**:
   - LibreChat's own documentation and blog recommend this to prevent HTTP-induced logouts.[1]
   - Use `mkcert` (a free tool) to generate and trust local SSL certificates for localhost:
     - Install `mkcert` via `brew install mkcert` or download from GitHub.
     - Run `mkcert -install` to install the root CA.
     - Create certs: `mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1`.
     - Configure LibreChat (e.g., via Docker env vars or config) to use these certs: Add `HTTPS=true`, `SSL_CRT_FILE=/path/to/localhost.pem`, and `SSL_KEY_FILE=/path/to/localhost-key.pem` in your `.env` file or environment.
     - Restart LibreChat and access via `https://localhost:3080`.
     - Safari will now treat it as secure, allowing seamless logins.

2. **Alternative: Use 127.0.0.1 Instead of localhost**:
   - Safari sometimes behaves differently with `localhost` (due to IPv6 or DNS resolution). Try accessing `http://127.0.0.1:3080` – this has resolved similar connection issues in some cases, though it may not fully fix auth persistence.[4][4][5]

3. **Clear Safari Website Data for localhost**:
   - Go to Safari > Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data > Search for "localhost" > Remove any entries.
   - This forces Safari to stop enforcing HTTPS upgrades or cached insecure contexts.[3][2]
   - Restart Safari and test; if LibreChat supports it, auth should hold.

If none of these work, check LibreChat logs for auth errors, ensure your `.env` has no conflicting flags (e.g., `ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=true` disables auth entirely if desired), and confirm you're not in Safari's private browsing mode, which blocks persistent storage.[6][7] If the problem persists, provide your LibreChat version and .env config for deeper troubleshooting.
