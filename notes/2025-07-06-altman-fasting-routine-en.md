title: Sam Altman's 15-Hour Fasting Routine
translated: false
---

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has publicly shared his practice of **intermittent fasting**.

Specifically, he states that he **rarely eats breakfast**, resulting in a daily fasting window of approximately **15 hours**. The only thing he consumes when he wakes up is an espresso.

Altman believes this routine offers various benefits, including:
* Promoting fat loss
* Reducing inflammation
* Protecting against age-related diseases

He also notes that while this approach works well for him, he suspects it might not be optimal for everyone, emphasizing the importance of individual experimentation to find what works best for one's own body.

Beyond fasting, Altman incorporates other health habits into his routine, such as regular blood testing to optimize his nutritional intake and supplementing with various vitamins. He is also a vegetarian and tries to avoid sugar and foods that cause inflammation or digestion issues.
