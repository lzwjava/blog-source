### Parking at Lianhuashan Park (North Gate), Shenzhen

Lianhuashan Park (also known as Lotus Hill Park) is a major urban green space in Shenzhen's Futian District, right near Shennan Avenue (Shennan Dadao). The north gate area connects directly to Shenzhen Book City, and its parking lot—called the "North Gate Reservation Ground Parking Lot"—is popular but often requires advance booking, especially on weekends, holidays, or during events like the Lantern Festival. Parking spaces can fill up quickly due to high visitor numbers, so pre-ordering a spot is recommended to avoid circling or fines.

#### How Pre-Ordering Works
Reservations are handled through the official WeChat mini program called **"Park Shenzhen" (公园深圳)**, accessible via the "Beautiful Shenzhen" (美丽深圳) WeChat official account. This is a free government-backed tool for booking spots in Shenzhen's public parks. Here's a step-by-step guide (all in Chinese, but you can use WeChat's translation feature or a helper app like Pleco for navigation):

1. **Open WeChat**: Search for and follow the "Beautiful Shenzhen" (美丽深圳) official account, or directly search for the "Park Shenzhen" mini program in WeChat's search bar (under "Discover" > "Mini Programs").
2. **Navigate to Parking**: In the mini program, go to the "Park Services" (公园服务) section, then select "Parking Reservation" (预约停车).
3. **Choose Online Booking**: Click "Online Appointment" (在线预约).
4. **Select the Park and Lot**: Search for "Lianhuashan Park" (莲花山公园), then pick the "North Gate" (北门) parking lot. You'll see real-time availability.
5. **Book Your Spot**: Enter your vehicle details (license plate number), select date/time (up to 2-7 days in advance, depending on the day), and confirm. Payment for parking fees (if any) is done via WeChat Pay upon arrival or exit—rates are about ¥5 for the first hour, then ¥1 per 30 minutes for small cars (workdays 8 AM-8 PM).
6. **At the Gate**: Scan a QR code at the entrance with your booking confirmation. The system validates your spot automatically.

- **Tips**: Book early (e.g., 1-2 days ahead for weekends). Capacity is limited (around 200-300 spots at north gate). If full, alternatives include south/west gate lots (no reservation needed but tighter) or nearby paid lots at Shenzhen Book City (¥10-20/hour, walkable to park).
- **Fees**: Free entry to the park; parking is pay-per-use, but reservations guarantee entry.
- **Location**: North gate is at approx. 2001 Hongli Road, Futian—super close to Shennan Dadao (about 1-2 km north).

If you're a foreigner, link an international card to WeChat Pay first (via the app's "Me" > "Services" > "Wallet"). A Chinese SIM helps for SMS verification.

#### Is Pre-Ordering Common in China (Shenzhen/Guangzhou)?
Yes, it's increasingly standard for high-traffic spots to manage crowds and reduce congestion—especially post-COVID. In **Shenzhen**, it's mandatory or highly advised for major parks like Lianhuashan, Shenzhen Bay Park, and Bijia Hill during peaks (holidays like Dragon Boat Festival). The "Park Shenzhen" mini program covers 20+ parks citywide.

In **Guangzhou**, it's similar but more focused on airports (e.g., Baiyun International via WeChat), malls, and tourist sites. Parks like Yuexiu or Baiyun Mountain often use apps like "Guangzhou Travel" mini program for reservations, especially for events. Overall, WeChat mini programs dominate (over 80% of urban bookings), with Alipay as a backup. It's not universal for small parks but common in big cities to avoid "parking wars."
