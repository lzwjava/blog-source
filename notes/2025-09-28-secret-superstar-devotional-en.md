### Lyrics of "Nachdi Phira"

"Nachdi Phira" is a Punjabi-Hindi song from the 2017 Bollywood film *Secret Superstar*, composed by Amit Trivedi and sung by Meghna Mishra. The lyrics are written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Below are the full lyrics:

**Verse 1**  
Teri hi boli boloongi main  
Teri hi baani gaaungi main  
Tere ishq da chola pehan ke  
Main tujhme hi rang jaungi  
Tere ishq da chooda pehan ke  
Main tujhme hi saj jaungi  

**Chorus**  
Mai nachdi phira  
Ban than baliye ho  
Main nachdi phira  
Chham chham chhaliye ho  

**Verse 2**  
Kehti hai duniya  
Main hoon banwariya  
Sudh se gayi main  
Khud se gayi main  
Teri ho gayi main  
Par jag kya jaane  
Man ke fasane  
Kho kar khud ko  
Paa kar tujh ko  
Meri ho gayi main  

**Verse 3**  
Teri nagariya jaungi main  
Teri nazariya varoongi main  
Tere ishq da chola pehan ke  
Main tujhme hi rang jaungi  
Tere ishq da chooda pehan ke  
Main tujhme hi saj jaungi  

**Chorus (Repeated)**  
Mai nachdi phira  
Ban than baliye ho  
Main nachdi phira  
Chham chham chhaliye ho  
Mai nachdi phira  
Ban than baliye ho  
Main nachdi phira  
Chham chham chhaliye ho  

### Explanation

"Nachdi Phira" is a joyful, devotional folk-inspired track that celebrates themes of love, devotion, and liberation through dance. The title itself translates to "I Dance and Twirl" in English, evoking the image of a woman spinning freely in ecstatic surrender, much like a Sufi dancer or a bride lost in bliss. The song draws heavily from Punjabi folk traditions, blending elements of bhakti (devotional love) with romantic longing, where the "love" in question can be interpreted as either divine (for God) or earthly (for a beloved).

#### Key Themes and Breakdown:
- **Devotion and Surrender (Ishq)**: The recurring motif of wearing the "chola" (robe) and "chooda" (bangles) of love symbolizes adorning oneself in the colors of devotion. Lines like "Tere ishq da chola pehan ke / Main tujhme hi rang jaungi" ("Wearing the robe of your love / I will blend into you") suggest complete immersion in the beloved, losing one's identity to merge with the divine or the loved one. This echoes Sufi poetry, where love erases the self.

- **Loss and Gain in Love**: In Verse 2, the singer reflects on worldly perceptions ("Kehti hai duniya / Main hoon banwariya" – "The world says / I am a madwoman"). She describes forsaking sanity ("Sudh se gayi main / Khud se gayi main" – "I've lost my senses / I've lost myself") to become "Teri ho gayi main" ("I've become yours"). Yet, this loss is a gain: "Kho kar khud ko / Paa kar tujh ko" ("By losing myself / I've found you"). It's a poignant commentary on how true love transforms madness into ecstasy, defying societal judgment.

- **Dance as Liberation**: The chorus is the heart of the song – "Mai nachdi phira / Ban than baliye ho" ("I dance and twirl / Adorned in finery"). "Ban than baliye ho" implies being dressed up like a bride, with the "chham chham" mimicking the jingle of bangles or ghungroo (ankle bells) during dance. This portrays dance not just as movement, but as a ritual of freedom, where the protagonist twirls away constraints, embodying unbridled joy and spiritual high.

In the context of *Secret Superstar*, which follows a young girl's pursuit of her singing dreams against patriarchal odds, the song serves as an anthem of empowerment. The innocent, childlike vocals by Meghna Mishra (a then-14-year-old) amplify its purity, making it a metaphor for breaking free from oppression through art and self-expression.

Overall, the song's upbeat rhythm, laced with dhol and flute, creates an infectious energy that invites listeners to embrace vulnerability as strength. It's a reminder that in love – whether for God, a person, or one's passion – true fulfillment comes from letting go and spinning into the unknown.
