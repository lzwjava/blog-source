For stir-frying rice with meat or vegetables (like making fried rice), **leftover rice from your last meal is the best choice**. Here's why, along with some quick tips:

### Why Leftover Rice?
- **Texture matters**: Freshly cooked rice from a rice cooker is hot, steamy, and very moist, which makes it sticky and prone to clumping or turning mushy when you stir-fry it. Leftover rice has had time to cool and dry out (ideally overnight in the fridge), so the grains separate easily, giving you that fluffy, non-gummy fried rice texture.
- **Flavor boost**: Chilled leftover rice absorbs flavors from the meat, veggies, oils, and seasonings better without getting soggy.

### Quick Tips for Using Leftover Rice
- **Prep it**: If your leftovers are fridge-cold and a bit dry, break up any clumps with your hands or a fork before stir-frying. No need to thaw if frozen—just add it straight to the hot wok/pan.
- **If you must use fresh rice**: It's not ideal, but you can spread it out on a baking sheet to cool completely (at least 30-60 minutes) and dry it a bit. Pat it dry with a towel if needed. Still, leftovers are superior.
- **Portion and storage**: Aim for medium- or long-grain rice (like jasmine or basmati) for the best results—they stay separate. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days or freeze for longer.

This is a classic technique in Asian cooking (e.g., Chinese fried rice or Indonesian nasi goreng). If you have a specific recipe or rice type in mind, I can refine this advice!
