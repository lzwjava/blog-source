title: Control-M Job Workflow and Dependencies Explained
translated: false
---

Great question! Let’s break it down step by step.

**Control-M** is a popular **Workload Automation and Job Scheduling tool** developed by BMC Software. It helps automate batch processes, job pipelines, and workflows across multiple systems and applications in enterprises.

---

## **Job Dependency in Control-M**
A **dependency** defines conditions that a job needs to meet before it can run. These could include:
- Another job finishing successfully (Job A must end “OK” before Job B runs).
- A file arriving at a specified location.
- A time condition (e.g., job can only run at 10 AM).
- A resource being available (e.g., a database connection).
- External conditions (such as an acknowledgment from another system).

So, job dependencies ensure proper sequence and integrity of batch processes.

---

## **Control-M Workflow**
In Control-M, a **workflow** is a series of dependent jobs organized together into a **folder**. This represents a process flow.

1. **Folder** – A container that holds related jobs. Folders can represent an application or a business process (e.g., "End of Day Processing").
2. **Job** – A single task that Control-M runs (like a script, file transfer, data pipeline, or ETL job).
3. **Dependencies** – Jobs are linked with conditions so that control flows in a specific sequence.
4. **Execution** – Control-M’s scheduler orchestrates the run based on the conditions and triggers.

---

## **Task and Folder in Detail**
- **Task (Job Task)**: The smallest execution unit. A task could be:
  - A script/job (shell script, batch file, etc.).
  - A database query.
  - A file transfer.
  - An API call or cloud workflow trigger.
  
- **Folder**: A logical container for multiple jobs/tasks. It:
  - Groups together related jobs.
  - Represents end-to-end workflow logic.
  - Allows setting overarching parameters (like calendars, run-time properties).
  - Supports **Smart Folders**, which apply common rules and conditions across all jobs inside.

---

## **Example of Workflow**
Imagine an **ETL process**:
1. Job A: Extract data from source → Job B depends on A finishing successfully.
2. Job B: Transform data → Job C depends on B finishing successfully.
3. Job C: Load data into data warehouse.
4. Job D: Send completion email (dependent on C).

All four jobs are placed inside a folder named **"Daily_ETL_Process"**. Control-M manages dependencies, retries, and failures automatically.

---

✅ In summary:  
- **Job** = individual unit of execution.  
- **Folder** = container grouping related jobs.  
- **Dependency** = condition(s) defining when jobs can run.  
- **Workflow** = sequence of jobs (in a folder) connected by dependencies.

Do you want me to also include a **diagram of a sample Control-M workflow** (with jobs and dependencies) so you can visualize it better?
