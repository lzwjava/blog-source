title: Git Clean Command Explained

### What the Command Does
The command `git clean -f -d` (assuming "clean clean" is a typo and you meant `git clean`) removes untracked files and directories from your Git working directory. The flags break down as:
- `-f` (force): Required to actually delete files, as Git won't remove them by default to avoid accidental data loss.
- `-d` (directories): Extends the cleanup to include untracked directories, not just files.

You wrote `-fd -f`, which combines `-f -d -f`. Since `-f` appears twice, it's redundant but harmless—flags can be repeated without issue. If you meant something else, clarify!

### How It Works
Git clean operates on the working tree (your local files), not the repository itself. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its behavior:

1. **Scans the Working Directory**: It identifies "untracked" items—files/directories not in the Git index or tracked by any commits. Examples: temporary files like `*.log`, build artifacts, or empty directories from removed branches.

2. **Applies Options**:
   - Without `-f`, it only shows what would be deleted (dry-run mode). With `-f`, it proceeds to delete.
   - Without `-d`, it skips directories. With `-d`, it removes empty or recursively empty directories containing untracked files.
   - It respects the `.gitignore` file by default: ignored files stay untouched unless you add `-x` (eXclude from ignore rules) or `-X` (only clean ignored files).

3. **Safety Measures**: Git warns if `-f` isn't used. It won't remove files in ignored directories unless explicitly told. Run `git clean --dry-run -f -d` first to preview changes.

4. **Example Usage**:
   - To clean interactively: `git clean -i` (prompts for each item).
   - Typical workflow: After `git reset`, use this to match your last commit exactly.

### Caveats and Proof
- **Risk**: Deleting files is irreversible without backups or `git reflog`. Always commit important work first.
- **Evidence from Git Docs**: The official Git documentation (e.g., `man git-clean` or docs at git-scm.com) confirms this: `-f` forces removal, `-d` includes directories. It uses filesystem operations like `unlink` and `rmdir`, but only on untracked items to avoid corrupting tracked data.
- **Testing Tip**: In a mock repo, create an untracked file and dir, then run the command—observe the output and file system changes.

If this doesn't match your intent, provide more context!
