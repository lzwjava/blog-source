### Who is Robert Greene?

Robert Greene is an American author, born on May 14, 1959, in Los Angeles, California, to Jewish parents. He is best known as a bestselling writer of non-fiction books on power, strategy, seduction, human behavior, and mastery. His works draw heavily from historical figures like Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, Napoleon, and modern examples, blending philosophy, psychology, and biography into practical guides. Greene's books have sold millions of copies worldwide, making him one of the most influential contemporary thinkers on ambition and self-improvement. He has been referenced by celebrities (e.g., Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Kanye West), politicians, and even banned in U.S. prisons for their perceived manipulative content. Greene lives in Los Angeles with filmmaker Anna Biller, speaks five languages, practices Zen Buddhism, and identifies as politically liberal.

### How Did He Become Successful?

Greene's path to success was unconventional and marked by persistence rather than early breakthroughs—he often describes it as an "overnight success after 30 years of failure." Here's a breakdown:

#### Early Life and Education
Raised in Los Angeles, Greene developed an early fascination with history and power dynamics. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, but transferred and earned a B.A. in classical studies from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1981. From a young age, he dreamed of becoming a writer but faced repeated rejections in his early attempts at fiction and screenwriting.

#### Early Career: The Grind of 50+ Jobs
For nearly two decades, Greene supported himself through an estimated 50–80 odd jobs, which he later credited with providing real-world insights into human nature and power. These included:
- Construction worker and dishwasher in various U.S. cities.
- Translator and teacher in Spain and Greece.
- Magazine editor and Hollywood script assistant.
- Waiter, tutor, and even a steel-drummer in the Caribbean.

This nomadic phase honed his observational skills but left him frustrated. By his early 30s, he was writing unpublishable novels and feeling directionless. In 1995, at age 36, he landed a job as a writer at Fabrica, an elite art and media school in Italy run by Benetton. There, he met book packager Joost Elffers, who became his key collaborator.

#### The Breakthrough: Pitching *The 48 Laws of Power*
While at Fabrica, Greene pitched Elffers an idea for a book distilling timeless "laws" of power from history, inspired by his classical studies and life experiences. He wrote a treatment (outline) in just two weeks, and they secured a deal with Viking Press. *The 48 Laws of Power* was published in 1998 when Greene was 39. The book—framed as 48 concise "laws" with historical anecdotes and modern applications—exploded in popularity:
- It sold over 1.2 million copies in the U.S. alone.
- Initially controversial for its amoral tone (critics called it a "backstabber's bible"), it resonated in Hollywood, hip-hop culture, and business circles.
- Word-of-mouth endorsements from figures like 50 Cent (who later co-authored a book with Greene) propelled it to cult status.

Greene has called this his life's turning point: "It took me 36 years to get the missing piece to my puzzle." The success allowed him to quit odd jobs and focus on writing full-time.

#### Building on Momentum: Bestsellers and Influence
Greene's formula—dense research (he reads 200–400 books per project), aphoristic style, and visual layouts—proved addictive. He followed up with more hits, each building his brand:
- Collaborations (e.g., with 50 Cent) expanded his reach into pop culture.
- Media appearances on CNN, The Today Show, TED, and Google Talks amplified his voice.
- By the 2010s, his books topped *The New York Times* and *USA Today* lists, with global audiobook success (e.g., *The 48 Laws* ranked top 5–6 on Spotify in 2024).

Challenges included a severe stroke in 2018 from a wasp-sting blood clot, which temporarily paralyzed his left side just before a book launch—but he recovered and continued. Today, at 66, his net worth is estimated in the millions from book sales, speaking fees, and adaptations. His success stems from relentless observation, historical synthesis, and tapping into universal desires for control and mastery.

### Major Books
Greene has authored or co-authored seven international bestsellers:
- *The 48 Laws of Power* (1998) – Strategies for gaining and wielding power.
- *The Art of Seduction* (2001) – Profiles of seducer archetypes and attraction tactics.
- *The 33 Strategies of War* (2006) – Military-inspired approaches to life's battles.
- *The 50th Law* (2009, with 50 Cent) – Fearlessness as the ultimate power law.
- *Mastery* (2012) – Paths to excellence through historical geniuses.
- *The Laws of Human Nature* (2018) – 18 laws decoding motivations and biases.
- *The Daily Laws* (2021) – Daily meditations on strategy and wisdom.

His works remain polarizing: empowering for some, cynical for others, but undeniably impactful.
