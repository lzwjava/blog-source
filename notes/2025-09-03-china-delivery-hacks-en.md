In China, it’s fairly common to add little requests in the delivery notes (配送备注), especially if you give a small tip (like 5 RMB). Here are some practical things you could ask a delivery person to do:

**1. Trash Help**
Ask them to take your household trash down to the community bin. This is very common—just write something like: “帮忙把垃圾带到楼下垃圾桶，给您5块，谢谢” (“Please help bring the trash downstairs to the bin, I’ll give you 5 RMB, thank you”).

**2. Face-to-Face Delivery**
Tell them not to leave the package at the gate or parcel locker, but to meet you directly. For example: “请一定送到门口，当面交给我，不要放快递柜” (“Please deliver to my door, hand it to me directly, don’t leave it in the parcel locker”).

**3. Extra Errands in the Complex**
If convenient, you can ask them to drop something off at the property office, security desk, or to a neighbor in the same building. A small tip helps here.

**4. Beverage Requests**
When ordering coffee, milk tea, or similar, you can ask the rider to shake/mix gently, keep the drink upright, or even bring straws/napkins carefully. Some people add: “请注意不要倒，辛苦啦” (“Please keep it upright, thanks”).

**5. Weather Considerations**
On rainy or very hot days, you can ask them to keep food in a shaded/covered area or call you before arrival so you can come down quickly.

💡 **Tips for Wording in Notes (Chinese context):**

* Keep it short and polite.
* Add “给您5块辛苦费” (“I’ll give you 5 RMB for your trouble”) if it’s beyond normal delivery.
* Always say “谢谢” to increase chances of compliance.

Do you want me to draft a few ready-to-use Chinese note templates (e.g., for trash help, must-meet delivery, or beverage care) that you could copy-paste into Meituan/Eleme order notes?
