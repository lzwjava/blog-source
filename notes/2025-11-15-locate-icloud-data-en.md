Here are the most reliable ways to figure out exactly where your iCloud data is physically stored (as of November 2025). Since you’re in Taiwan (TW), your data is **not** in China — it’s treated as “overseas”/global.

### Quick Checks You Can Do Yourself

1. **Check your Apple ID region setting** (this is the #1 indicator)
   - On iPhone/iPad: Settings → [your name] → Payment & Shipping → look at the country/region listed
   - Or: Settings → [your name] → Media & Purchases → View Account → Country/Region
   - If it says “Taiwan” or anything other than “China mainland”, your iCloud data is stored outside China (usually in the U.S., Singapore, or other global Apple data centers).

2. **Look at iCloud Terms & Conditions language when you log in**
   - Go to icloud.com on a computer and sign in.
   - If you see the regular global terms (operated by Apple Inc. or Apple Distribution International), you’re on global servers.
   - If it ever shows “iCloud operated by GCBD” or mentions Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, it’s China (you won’t see this from Taiwan).

3. **Check the iCloud data center partner notice (official Apple page)**
   Apple publishes this list:  
   https://support.apple.com/en-us/111754  
   - Taiwan = “Apple” (global infrastructure)  
   - China mainland = “Guizhou-Cloud Big Data”

4. **Use Apple’s System Status page (indirect clue)**
   Sometimes during outages you’ll see which data center is affected. Taiwan users are grouped with Asia-Pacific/global, never with the separate “China mainland” row.

5. **Ping iCloud servers (technical method)**
   Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:
   ```
   ping -c 3 www.icloud.com
   ping -c 3 www.icloud.com.cn
   ```
   - Taiwan accounts resolve to global IPs (usually in Singapore or U.S.).
   - China mainland accounts resolve to .cn domains and GCBD IPs in Guizhou.

### Summary for Taiwan Users (2025)
- Your iCloud photos, backups, messages, etc. are stored in Apple-owned or Apple-controlled data centers outside mainland China (mostly U.S. or Singapore for Asia-Pacific).
- Encryption keys are also managed by Apple globally (not handed to a state partner like in China).
- Zero chance your data is in the Guizhou data center unless you deliberately created a +86 China mainland Apple ID.

So unless you specifically set your Apple ID region to “China mainland” and use a +86 phone number, you’re 100% on global servers.
