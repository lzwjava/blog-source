The GRE (Graduate Record Examination) is a standardized test used mainly for admissions into U.S. and some international graduate schools, especially for master’s and PhD programs. It’s widely required for Computer Science, Engineering, Business, and other fields.

## GRE Structure

The GRE General Test has three main sections:

1. **Analytical Writing (AWA)**

   * 2 essays: *Analyze an Issue* and *Analyze an Argument*.
   * Tests critical thinking, logical reasoning, and ability to express ideas clearly.

2. **Verbal Reasoning**

   * Tests vocabulary, reading comprehension, and critical reasoning.
   * Typical question types: sentence equivalence, text completion, reading comprehension.
   * Strong vocabulary is crucial.

3. **Quantitative Reasoning (Math)**

   * Covers arithmetic, algebra, geometry, data analysis.
   * Focuses on reasoning and problem-solving, not extremely advanced math.
   * Similar to high-school level but requires speed and accuracy.

## Preparation Strategies

### For All Students

* **Take a diagnostic test early**: Know your baseline score and weak areas.
* **Make a study plan**: Usually 3–6 months is enough for consistent preparation.
* **Use official materials**: ETS GRE Official Guide, PowerPrep practice tests.
* **Simulate test conditions**: Practice with a timer on a computer.

### For Chinese Students (Specific Tips)

1. **Verbal Vocabulary Challenge**

   * This is the hardest part for many Chinese students.
   * Build vocabulary systematically (Barron’s 333, Magoosh word list, Anki flashcards).
   * Practice not just memorizing but applying words in context.

2. **Reading Comprehension**

   * English reading speed is often a bottleneck.
   * Read *The Economist*, *Scientific American*, or academic papers to get used to GRE-style passages.
   * Practice skimming for structure and argument, not translating word by word.

3. **Writing (AWA)**

   * Chinese students often write grammatically correct but stiff essays.
   * Practice writing short essays daily.
   * Learn templates for Issue and Argument essays, then customize with real examples.
   * Focus on logical flow rather than advanced vocabulary.

4. **Quantitative Reasoning**

   * Usually easier for Chinese students due to strong math background.
   * Still practice: questions can be tricky with wording.
   * Learn to avoid careless mistakes and manage time.

## Final Advice

* Treat GRE as both an *exam of skill* and *test-taking strategy*.
* Focus on weak sections first (usually verbal for Chinese students).
* Practice consistently and review mistakes deeply.
* Don’t aim for perfection—most U.S. CS programs are happy with 320+ (out of 340), but top schools may prefer 325–330+.
