translated: false
---

Java's versatility extends far beyond Java agents, powering a wide range of innovative and practical projects. The PySonar2 project you mentioned is a great example of Java’s capability to build sophisticated tools, in this case, a semantic indexer for Python with interprocedural type inference. Below, I’ll highlight other interesting and useful Java-based projects that may not be mainstream but showcase Java’s strengths in various domains. These projects span tools, frameworks, games, and more, emphasizing Java’s portability, robustness, and ecosystem.

### Interesting and Useful Java Projects (Beyond Java Agents)

1. **TeaVM**  
   - **What it is**: TeaVM is an open-source project that transpiles Java bytecode to JavaScript or WebAssembly (Wasm). It enables developers to write web applications in Java and deploy them in browsers, leveraging Java’s type safety and libraries.  
   - **Why it’s interesting**: It bridges Java with modern web development, allowing developers to use frameworks like Spring or Hibernate in browser-based apps. This is particularly useful for full-stack developers who prefer Java’s ecosystem but need to target the web.  
   - **Use case**: Building complex web applications with Java’s robust frameworks without needing extensive JavaScript knowledge.
