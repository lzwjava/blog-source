Basic NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks are foundational for understanding, processing, and generating human language. Here are some core tasks in NLP:

### 1. **Tokenization**
   - Splitting text into smaller units such as words, sentences, or subwords.
   - Example:
     - Input: "Natural Language Processing is fun!"
     - Output: ["Natural", "Language", "Processing", "is", "fun", "!"]

### 2. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**
   - Assigning grammatical tags (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to words in a sentence.
   - Example:
     - Input: "I love NLP."
     - Output: [("I", "PRP"), ("love", "VBP"), ("NLP", "NN")]

### 3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - Identifying and classifying entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) in text.
   - Example:
     - Input: "Barack Obama was born in Hawaii."
     - Output: [("Barack Obama", "PERSON"), ("Hawaii", "LOCATION")]

### 4. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Determining the sentiment or emotion conveyed by text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
   - Example:
     - Input: "I love this movie!"
     - Output: "Positive"

### 5. **Lemmatization and Stemming**
   - Reducing words to their root forms.
   - Example:
     - Input: "running", "ran", "runs"
     - Output (Lemmatization): "run"
     - Output (Stemming): "run"

### 6. **Stop Word Removal**
   - Removing common words (e.g., "and", "is", "the") that do not add significant meaning.
   - Example:
     - Input: "The cat is on the mat."
     - Output: ["cat", "mat"]

### 7. **Text Classification**
   - Categorizing text into predefined classes or labels.
   - Example:
     - Input: "This is a sports article."
     - Output: "Sports"

### 8. **Language Modeling**
   - Predicting the next word in a sequence or assigning probabilities to sequences of words.
   - Example:
     - Input: "The cat sat on the ___"
     - Output: ["mat" (0.8), "chair" (0.1), "floor" (0.1)]

### 9. **Machine Translation**
   - Translating text from one language to another.
   - Example:
     - Input: "Hello, how are you?"
     - Output: "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"

### 10. **Text Summarization**
   - Generating a concise summary from a longer text.
   - Example:
     - Input: "Natural language processing is a subfield of AI. It involves understanding and generating human language."
     - Output: "NLP is a subfield of AI for understanding and generating language."

### 11. **Coreference Resolution**
   - Identifying when different words refer to the same entity.
   - Example:
     - Input: "Alice said she would come."
     - Output: "Alice" -> "she"

### 12. **Question Answering**
   - Answering questions based on a given context or knowledge.
   - Example:
     - Input: Context: "Paris is the capital of France."
       Question: "What is the capital of France?"
     - Output: "Paris"

### 13. **Word Embeddings**
   - Representing words as continuous vectors in a high-dimensional space.
   - Example:
     - Input: "king", "queen", "man", "woman"
     - Output: Relationships such as "king - man + woman ≈ queen"

### 14. **Spell Checking and Text Normalization**
   - Correcting misspellings and standardizing text (e.g., "u r" -> "you are").
   - Example:
     - Input: "I luv NLP!"
     - Output: "I love NLP!"

### 15. **Text Generation**
   - Generating coherent text from a model or input prompt.
   - Example:
     - Input: "Once upon a time,"
     - Output: "Once upon a time, there lived a brave knight in a faraway kingdom."

These tasks serve as building blocks for more complex NLP systems and applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and recommendation systems.
