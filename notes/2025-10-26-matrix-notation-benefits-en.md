I totally get where you're coming from—coming from an engineering background myself (in spirit, at least), I thrive on that crisp, indexed notation for matrices. It turns what could be a vague "plug in the numbers" vibe into a precise blueprint, making it easier to debug, generalize, or scale up to bigger systems. Your example with the cofactor \\( C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} \det(M_{ij}) \\) and the adjugate as \\( \adj(A) = C^T \\) (where the (i,j) entry is actually \\( C_{ji} \\)) is spot-on; that level of detail prevents mix-ups, like confusing the minor with the cofactor or forgetting the transpose step. It's like labeling every wire in a circuit diagram—tedious at first glance, but it saves hours of head-scratching later.

### My Take on It
I love this style. It's rigorous without being pedantic, and it aligns perfectly with how engineers (and physicists, coders, etc.) often think: modular, verifiable, and ready for implementation. In linear algebra, where matrices can represent anything from stress tensors to neural net weights, explicit indices make the math *executable*—you can almost see the loops in your code mirroring the summation. Plus, it bridges theory and practice; I've seen folks breeze through derivations because the notation forces you to track dependencies clearly. If more textbooks or LLMs defaulted to this, we'd cut down on those "wait, which row did I delete?" moments.

That said, matrix annotation isn't always good (or at least, not always *optimal*) for a few reasons:
- **Overload for beginners or quick sketches**: If someone's just trying to compute a 2x2 inverse by hand, slapping on full \\( i,j \\) indices feels like overkill—like using a CAD program to doodle a stick figure. It can slow comprehension when the goal is intuition over formality.
- **Readability in dense text**: In prose-heavy explanations, heavy indexing can clutter the page, turning a fluid narrative into a LaTeX soup. Visual aids (like partitioned matrices) or verbal shortcuts ("the minor from row 1, col 2") work better for storytelling.
- **Context mismatch**: In applied fields like ML or graphics, we often abuse notation for brevity (e.g., Einstein summation implied), assuming the audience fills in the indices. Forcing explicit ones here might obscure the "big picture" forest for the indexed trees.
- **Tool limitations**: Not every medium renders sub/superscripts well (think emails or whiteboards), so it risks coming off as sloppy or inaccessible.

The key is audience and purpose—your style shines in technical deep dives, but flexes poorly in casual or high-level overviews. Balance is everything.

### A Prompt to Make LLMs Stick to This Style
To nudge an LLM (like me, or others) into consistently using clear, indexed matrix annotations, try this as a **system prompt** (if you're using something like ChatGPT's custom instructions) or prepend it to your **user queries**. It's engineered to be specific, positive, and self-reinforcing without being too wordy:

**System Prompt:**  
You are a precise linear algebra tutor with an engineering mindset. In every response involving matrices, vectors, or tensors:  
- Always use explicit index notation (e.g., \\( a_{ij} \\) for the (i,j)-entry of matrix A, with i for rows and j for columns, 1-indexed).  
- Define submatrices clearly (e.g., \\( M_{ij} \\) as the submatrix deleting row i and column j).  
- For operations like cofactors, minors, or adjugates, show the full formula with signs and transposes (e.g., \\( C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} \det(M_{ij}) \\), \\( \adj(A) = C^T \\)).  
- Annotate examples with indices inline, even for small matrices, to build clarity.  
- If brevity is needed, note it explicitly but default to indexed detail. Keep explanations step-by-step and verifiable.

Example user query with this prompt: "Explain the adjugate of a 3x3 matrix."  
(The LLM should then spit out something like your quote, with indices everywhere.)

Tweak the "engineering mindset" bit if you want it more domain-specific (e.g., "control systems focus"). Test it on a few queries—if it drifts, add "Enforce this in 100% of matrix-related responses" for extra stickiness. Let me know how it works, or if you want variants!
