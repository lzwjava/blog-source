title: Fixing GPG Signature Verification Errors
translated: false
---

### Understanding the Error

The error you're seeing occurs because the `gpg --verify` command expects two arguments in most cases: the **signature file** (e.g., `zhs.tw.yaml.sig` or `zhs.tw.yaml.asc`) **first**, followed by the **actual file** to verify (e.g., `zhs.tw.yaml`). 

In your command:
```
gpg --verify zhs.tw.yaml
```
GPG is trying to interpret `zhs.tw.yaml` as both the signature *and* the data file, but it doesn't contain valid OpenPGP signature data (YAML files aren't signatures). Hence the "no valid OpenPGP data found" message.

### How to Fix It

1. **Locate the Signature File**: You need the detached signature file that matches your YAML. It's usually named something like:
   - `zhs.tw.yaml.sig` (binary format)
   - `zhs.tw.yaml.asc` (ASCII-armored format)

   If you don't have it, you'll need to download it from the source where you got `zhs.tw.yaml` (e.g., a project repo or website).

2. **Run the Correct Command**: Once you have the signature, use this format:
   ```
   gpg --verify zhs.tw.yaml.sig zhs.tw.yaml
   ```
   - Replace `.sig` with `.asc` if that's your file.
   - The order matters: signature first, then the file.

3. **Expected Output on Success**:
   If the signature is valid and you trust the key, you'll see something like:
   ```
   gpg: Signature made [date] using [key type]
   gpg: Good signature from "[signer name/email]"
   ```
   If it's invalid or the key isn't trusted, you'll get warnings/errors.

### Additional Tips

- **Import the Public Key**: If GPG complains about an unknown key, fetch and import the signer's public key:
  ```
  gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys [KEY_ID]
  ```
  (Replace `[KEY_ID]` with the actual key fingerprint from the error output or the project's docs.)

- **Batch Mode for Scripts**: If you're automating this, add `--batch` to suppress prompts:
  ```
  gpg --batch --verify zhs.tw.yaml.sig zhs.tw.yaml
  ```

- **Inline Signatures**: If the signature is *embedded* in the YAML (unlikely for `.yaml`), you'd just do `gpg --verify zhs.tw.yaml` after ensuring the file ends with `-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----`. But based on the error, it's detached.

If this doesn't resolve it or you share more details (e.g., where the file came from), I can refine the advice!
