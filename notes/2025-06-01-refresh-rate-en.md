To determine if your monitor is running at 60Hz or a higher refresh rate (like 120Hz), you can use a few different methods, including watching specific test videos or using online tools. Here's how:

### **Method 1: Use Online Refresh Rate Test Websites**
Several websites can help you detect your monitor's refresh rate:

1. **TestUFO (Blur Busters)**  
   - Visit: [https://www.testufo.com/](https://www.testufo.com/)  
   - This site displays moving UFOs and shows your detected refresh rate at the bottom.  
   - If it says **"60Hz"**, your monitor is running at 60Hz.  
   - If it shows **"120Hz" or higher**, your monitor is running at the higher refresh rate.  

2. **Frame Rate Test Videos (YouTube)**  
   - Search for **"120Hz vs 60Hz test"** or **"refresh rate test"** on YouTube.  
   - Example video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXt8y2X9WkA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXt8y2X9WkA)  
   - If the motion looks **smoother and less blurry**, your monitor is likely running at 120Hz.  
   - If it looks **choppier**, it's probably at 60Hz.  

### **Method 2: Check Display Settings (Manual Verification)**
- **Windows:**  
  - Right-click on the desktop → **Display Settings** → **Advanced Display Settings** → **Display Adapter Properties** → **Monitor Tab** → Check **"Screen Refresh Rate"**.  
- **macOS:**  
  - Go to **System Preferences** → **Displays** → Hold **Option** and click **"Scaled"** to see refresh rate options.  
- **Gaming Consoles (PS5/Xbox):**  
  - Go to **Settings** → **Display** → Check **Video Output Information**.  

### **Method 3: Use a High-Speed Camera (Smartphone Slow-Mo)**
- Record your monitor (at 60Hz vs 120Hz) with a smartphone in **slow-motion mode (240fps or higher)**.  
- If the screen flickers noticeably, it's likely **60Hz**.  
- If it appears smoother, it's running at **120Hz or higher**.  

### **Key Differences Between 60Hz and 120Hz**

| Feature        | 60Hz Monitor | 120Hz Monitor |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Motion Smoothness | Slight blur in fast motion | Much smoother motion |
| Gaming Feel   | More input lag | Lower input lag |
| Video Playback | Standard playback | Smoother if content supports high FPS |
| Mouse Cursor Movement | Slightly choppy | Very smooth |

### **Conclusion**
- If you **see a noticeable smoothness difference** in motion, your monitor is likely running at 120Hz.  
- If motion looks **standard (some blur)**, it's probably 60Hz.  
- Use **TestUFO or system settings** for the most accurate confirmation.
