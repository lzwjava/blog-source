### Acquisition Timeline and Process

IBM's acquisition of Red Hat, a major player in open-source software and enterprise solutions, was a landmark deal completed in 2019. Announced in October 2018, it aimed to bolster IBM's hybrid cloud offerings by integrating Red Hat's Linux and container technologies, and resulted in IBM becoming a leading hybrid cloud provider.[1][2][3]

#### Key Dates and Milestones
- **Announcement**: IBM intended to acquire Red Hat on October 28, 2018, for $34 billion, equating to $190 per share—a 63% premium over the previous close.[4][2][5]
- **Regulatory Approvals**: The deal faced scrutiny from regulators, including antitrust reviews in the U.S. (Federal Trade Commission), European Union, and other jurisdictions. It was cleared after IBM agreed to certain concessions, such as preserving Red Hat's business practices and allowing continued support for competitors like Microsoft.[5][6]
- **Completion**: The acquisition closed on July 9, 2019, following shareholder approvals from both companies.[4][1][2]

#### Financial Details
- **Total Value**: $34 billion in cash, making it IBM's largest acquisition ever and the third-largest in U.S. IT history at the time.[5][7]
- **Payment Structure**: All-cash deal, with IBM financing it largely through debt.[6]
- **Market Impact**: Red Hat's stock had risen 170% in the five years prior, while IBM's had declined 30%, highlighting the strategic fit in a broader tech M&A wave that year.[5]

#### Advisors and Negotiations
- **IBM Advisors**: Lazard, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase.[5]
- **Red Hat Advisors**: Guggenheim Partners and Morgan Stanley.[5]
- The deal was structured as a stock-for-stock transaction initially but finalized as cash-only to simplify the process.[5][6]

#### Strategic Rationale and Outcomes
IBM acquired Red Hat to enhance its hybrid multicloud platform, promote open-source innovation, and create secure, portable cloud solutions. Red Hat operates as an independent unit within IBM, retaining its autonomy, brand, and commitment to open source, while integrating with IBM's services like Kubernetes and AI.[1][3][8][6][4]

This acquisition marked a shift toward open-hybrid cloud markets, positioning IBM as the top hybrid cloud provider globally.[1][3][8]
