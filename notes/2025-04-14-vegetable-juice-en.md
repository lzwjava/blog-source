It's generally **okay** to drink vegetable-fruit juice, including tomato juice, as part of a balanced diet. **NFC (Not From Concentrate)** juice is simply a type of processing that retains more of the original flavor and nutrients compared to juice made from concentrate.

However, there are a few things to consider regarding sugar content and the specific caloric value you mentioned:

**Sugar Content:**

* **Natural Sugars:** Vegetable and fruit juices contain natural sugars. Even though they aren't "added sugars," they are still sugars and contribute to your overall sugar intake.
* **Tomato Juice:** Tomato juice generally has a lower sugar content compared to many fruit juices. Per 100g, it typically contains around 2-3 grams of sugar.
* **Fruit Juices:** The sugar content in fruit juices varies widely depending on the fruit. Some fruits like grapes, mangoes, and apples are naturally higher in sugar.
* **Overall Intake:** It's important to be mindful of your total daily sugar intake from all sources, as excessive sugar consumption can have negative health effects. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends limiting free sugar intake to less than 10% of total daily calories, and ideally less than 5%.

**Caloric Value (195 cal per 100 ml):**

* **This is a very high caloric density for juice.** Most natural, unsweetened fruit and vegetable juices have significantly fewer calories per 100 ml. For example, orange juice is often around 45-50 calories per 100 ml, and tomato juice is around 17-20 calories per 100 ml.
* **Likely Added Ingredients:** A juice with 195 calories per 100 ml likely has a significant amount of added sugar, other high-calorie ingredients, or is not a pure vegetable/fruit juice.
* **Check the Label:** You **must** check the nutrition label of this specific juice to understand its ingredients and where those 195 calories per 100 ml are coming from. It might contain added sugars, oils, or be a blend with very high-calorie fruits.

**In summary:**

* Drinking NFC vegetable-fruit juice, including tomato juice, can be a way to get some vitamins and minerals.
* Tomato juice itself is relatively low in sugar.
* **A juice with 195 calories per 100 ml is unusually high in calories for pure fruit or vegetable juice and likely contains added ingredients that increase the sugar and calorie content significantly.**
* **It is crucial to check the nutrition label of that specific juice to determine its sugar content and ingredients before considering it a regular part of your diet.** Consuming such a high-calorie juice regularly could contribute to excessive calorie and sugar intake.

Consider diluting fruit juices with water or prioritizing whole fruits and vegetables over juice to get more fiber and manage sugar intake more effectively.
