Yes, you're on the right track with understanding the **NanoGPT** architecture (as implemented in Andrej Karpathy's popular repository), but let's clarify and structure it properly — especially the relationship between **sequence length (512 tokens)**, **heads**, **embeddings**, and the **transformer blocks**.

---

### NanoGPT Overview (Typical Config)
NanoGPT is a **from-scratch GPT-2-like model** trained on Shakespeare (or tiny datasets). The default config is roughly **GPT-2 small** scaled down.

| Parameter | Typical Value in NanoGPT |
|---------|--------------------------|
| `block_size` (max sequence length) | **512** |
| `n_embd` (embedding dimension) | **768** (for 124M model) |
| `n_head` | **12** |
| `n_layer` | **12** |

But for **smaller demos**, it uses even tinier configs (e.g., 64M or less).

### Your Question Breakdown:

> "for every 512 tokens, they have GPT model"

**No.**  
The **entire input sequence is 512 tokens**, and **one GPT model processes all 512 tokens at once** (in parallel during training, autoregressively during inference).

So:
- Input: batch of sequences, each up to **512 tokens**
- One single GPT model processes **all 512 positions in parallel** (thanks to attention masking)

---

> "512 will be like 8 head 64 tokens"

**Close, but not quite.**

Let’s clarify **multi-head attention**:

- `n_embd` = total embedding dimension (e.g., 768)
- `n_head` = number of attention heads (e.g., 12)
- **Head dimension** = `n_embd // n_head` = `768 // 12 = 64`

So:
- Each head operates on **64-dimensional vectors**
- There are **12 heads**, each looking at all **512 tokens**
- Total: 12 heads × 64 dim = 768 dim

So yes — **each head processes 512 tokens with 64-dim queries/keys/values**

```
Input: [512 tokens] → each token has 768-dim embedding
       ↓ split into 12 heads
       → each head: 512 × 64 matrix (Q, K, V)
       → self-attention over 512 positions
```

---

### Inside the Transformer Block (Forward Pass)

Each **transformer block** does:

```python
def forward(x):
    # x: [batch, seq_len=512, n_embd=768]

    # 1. LayerNorm + Multi-Head Self-Attention
    attn_out = self.attn(self.ln1(x))   # 12 heads, each 64-dim
    x = x + attn_out                    # residual

    # 2. LayerNorm + Feed-Forward (MLP)
    ff_out = self.mlp(self.ln2(x))      # usually 4× expansion (3072 dim)
    x = x + ff_out                      # residual

    return x
```

This block is repeated `n_layer` times (e.g., 12).

### Full Forward Pass Summary

```python
Input tokens → [B, 512]
→ Token + Position Embeddings → [B, 512, 768]
→ For each of 12 layers:
    → Multi-Head Attention (12 heads × 64 dim) over 512 tokens
    → Feed-Forward (768 → 3072 → 768)
→ Final LayerNorm
→ Linear head → logits [B, 512, vocab_size]
```

### Key Points

| Concept | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Max sequence length | 512 tokens |
| Model processes | **All 512 tokens at once** |
| Attention heads | 12 (for 124M model) |
| Per head dim | 64 |
| Attention computes | `softmax(QK^T / √64)` over **512×512** matrix |
| Causal masking | Ensures token only attends to past |

### Visual

```
[Token 1] → emb → [768]
[Token 2] → emb → [768]
...
[Token 512] → emb → [768]
      ↓
[512 × 768] → 12 Transformer Blocks
      ↓
[512 × 768] → Linear → [512 × 50257] logits
```

Each block has **12 attention heads**, each doing attention over **all 512 positions**.

### Reference (NanoGPT code)
From `model.py`:
```python
self.transformer = nn.ModuleDict(dict(
    wte = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_embd),
    wpe = nn.Embedding(block_size, n_embd),
    h = nn.ModuleList([Block(n_embd, n_head) for _ in range(n_layer)]),
    ln_f = nn.LayerNorm(n_embd),
))
```

And in `Block`:
```python
self.attn = CausalSelfAttention(n_embd, n_head)  # n_head=12, head_size=64
```

---

### Final Answer to Your Question

> **Yes**, in NanoGPT:
- The model takes **up to 512 tokens** as input.
- It uses **multi-head attention** (e.g., 12 heads).
- Each head works with **64-dimensional vectors**.
- **Inside each transformer block**, there is a **forward pass** with:
  - Self-attention over all 512 tokens (causal)
  - Feed-forward network
- The **entire GPT model** (all layers) processes **all 512 tokens in parallel** during training.

So your intuition is **mostly correct** — just remember: **one model, 512 tokens, 12 heads × 64 dim, repeated in layers**.

Let me know if you want the exact config for 124M vs smaller models!
