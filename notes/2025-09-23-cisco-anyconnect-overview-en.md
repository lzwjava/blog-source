Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client is a suite of software modules that provide secure VPN access, network security, and policy-based endpoint features. One of the optional modules in this suite is **Cisco Network Access Manager (NAM).**

### What Cisco AnyConnect NAM Does
- **Network Connection Management**: NAM replaces the native Windows wireless and wired network managers. It handles configuring, connecting to, and securing both wired and wireless networks.
- **Advanced 802.1X Support**: Provides comprehensive **802.1X authentication** for wired and wireless network connections (EAP-TLS, PEAP, EAP-FAST, etc.), often used in enterprise environments where certificate-based authentication or endpoint posture is required.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Administrators can define policies that determine how end-user devices connect to networks—prioritizing security requirements, defining allowed SSIDs, or restricting insecure connections.
- **Consistent Behavior Across Platforms**: It delivers centralized control so users get the same network access experience regardless of which PC they are on.

### Key Notes
- **Platform Support**: Historically, NAM was only supported on Windows. Cisco dropped NAM support starting with later AnyConnect versions (from v4.9 onward), as native OS network managers (Windows Native Wi-Fi, macOS supplicant, etc.) became more robust.
- **Typical Usage**: Primarily deployed in enterprises, universities, or government networks that require secure, certificate-based login to Wi-Fi or wired LAN before or during system logon.

👉 In short: **Cisco AnyConnect NAM (Network Access Manager)** is an advanced network connection manager that replaces the Windows native supplicant to handle secure wired/wireless connections using 802.1X authentication and enterprise-defined policies.

Would you like me to also explain **how NAM fits in compared to the more commonly used AnyConnect VPN module** (since most people today only know the VPN part)?
