title: Becoming a Lead Software Engineer or Staff Software Engineer
translated: false
type: note

Becoming a Lead Software Engineer or Staff Software Engineer is a natural stepping stone toward roles like Principal Software Engineer. These positions sit between Senior Engineer and Principal, focusing on technical leadership, broader impact, and complex problem-solving, often with less managerial responsibility than a traditional manager role. Here’s how to get there:

---

### Lead Software Engineer
A Lead Engineer typically oversees a team or project, guiding technical execution while still coding and mentoring. Think of it as a "team captain" role.

#### 1. Build Core Skills
- **Technical Proficiency**: Be a strong Senior Engineer first—master your tech stack, write clean code, and understand system design basics (e.g., REST APIs, databases, caching).
- **Project Ownership**: Take full responsibility for a feature or system, from design to deployment. Handle trade-offs like speed vs. quality.
- **Mentorship**: Start helping junior engineers with debugging, code reviews, or explaining concepts.

#### 2. Show Leadership
- **Drive Projects**: Volunteer to lead initiatives, even small ones. Define tasks, coordinate with teammates, and ensure delivery.
- **Communicate Clearly**: Write specs, update stakeholders, and present your work. A Lead bridges tech and non-tech teams.
- **Resolve Conflicts**: Mediate technical disagreements (e.g., tabs vs. spaces, monolith vs. microservices) with data and reasoning.

#### 3. Gain Visibility
- **Step Up**: When a project lacks direction, propose a plan. Be the one who says, “Here’s how we’ll do this.”
- **Earn Trust**: Deliver consistently and be reliable in crises (e.g., fixing a production bug at 2 a.m.).
- **Advocate for Yourself**: Tell your manager you’re aiming for a Lead role and ask what’s needed.

#### Timeline
- Often achievable with 5-8 years of experience, depending on your impact and company size.

#### Practical Steps
- Lead your next sprint: assign tasks, track progress, and report results.
- Mentor a new hire or intern on a small task.
- Propose a process improvement (e.g., better testing practices).

### Staff Software Engineer
A Staff Engineer operates at a higher scope, tackling cross-team or company-wide challenges. They’re less about day-to-day team leadership and more about technical strategy and big-picture problem-solving. Think of it as a "technical architect" role.

#### 1. Expand Technical Depth & Breadth
- **Master Systems**: Understand how multiple systems interact (e.g., frontend, backend, infra). Study distributed systems, scalability, or cloud architecture.
- **Solve Hard Problems**: Tackle issues that span teams, like reducing downtime across services or unifying a tech stack.
- **Stay Hands-On**: You’ll still code, but focus on critical pieces (e.g., a core library) rather than routine tasks.

#### 2. Think Strategically
- **See the Big Picture**: Align your work with business goals—e.g., “This refactor saves $100K in server costs.”
- **Influence Decisions**: Contribute to architecture reviews, tech roadmaps, or tool choices. Back your ideas with data or prototypes.
- **Handle Ambiguity**: Define problems when requirements are unclear. Staff Engineers often set the direction.

#### 3. Lead Without Authority
- **Cross-Team Impact**: Collaborate with other teams to solve shared problems (e.g., standardizing APIs).
- **Mentor at Scale**: Teach through docs, talks, or workshops, not just 1:1. Build reusable solutions others adopt.
- **Be a Multiplier**: Enable others to succeed—your success is measured by team or org-wide outcomes.

#### 4. Navigate the Promotion
- **Demonstrate Impact**: Quantify your work (e.g., “Improved throughput by 30% across 5 services”).
- **Build Relationships**: Gain support from peers and senior leaders who’ll vouch for your expertise.
- **Ask for It**: Many companies don’t advertise Staff roles—pitch yourself with a case of your contributions.

#### Timeline
- Typically requires 8-12 years of experience, though exceptional engineers can hit it earlier with standout achievements.

#### Practical Steps
- Pick a cross-team problem (e.g., slow builds) and propose a solution with a proof-of-concept.
- Write a design doc for a system improvement and get feedback from senior engineers.
- Present a technical topic at a team meeting or company all-hands.

### Key Differences
- **Lead**: Team-focused, execution-oriented, often tied to a specific project or squad.
- **Staff**: Org-focused, strategy-oriented, works on broader, thornier issues.

### General Tips for Both
- **Feedback Loop**: Regularly ask your manager, “What would make me a strong candidate for Lead/Staff?” Act on it.
- **Learn from Others**: Shadow or talk to current Leads/Staff Engineers at your company. What do they do daily?
- **Document Wins**: Keep a brag doc of your achievements—crucial for promotion discussions.
