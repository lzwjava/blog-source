Yes, that's a solid high-level way to think about GPG (GnuPG)—it primarily revolves around two core areas:

1. **Key Management**: This includes generating key pairs (public/private), importing/exporting keys, listing/editing keys, signing keys, revoking them, and managing trust levels. Commands like `gpg --gen-key`, `--import`, `--list-keys`, and `--edit-key` handle this.

2. **Encrypt/Decrypt (and Related Ops)**: This covers encrypting files or messages with public keys (so only the recipient can decrypt with their private key), decrypting with your private key, plus signing/verifying data for authenticity. Commands like `gpg -e -r user@example.com` (encrypt), `gpg -d` (decrypt), and `-s` (sign) fall here.

It's all built on asymmetric cryptography (public-key systems like RSA or ECC), but GPG also supports symmetric encryption for simpler cases. If you're diving deeper, the signing/verification is often bundled with encrypt/decrypt workflows for end-to-end security.
