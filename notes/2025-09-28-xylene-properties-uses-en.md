I believe you're asking about "二甲苯" (èrjiǎběn), which is the Chinese term for **xylene**.

Xylene is an organic chemical compound with the formula C₈H₁₀. It's an aromatic hydrocarbon that exists in three isomeric forms:

- **ortho-xylene (o-xylene)**
- **meta-xylene (m-xylene)** 
- **para-xylene (p-xylene)**

**Common uses of xylene include:**
- Solvent in paints, varnishes, and adhesives
- Cleaning agent and degreaser
- Raw material in plastic production (especially PET bottles from para-xylene)
- Component in gasoline
- Laboratory solvent
- Paint thinner

**Properties:**
- Clear, colorless liquid
- Sweet aromatic odor
- Flammable
- Less dense than water
- Derived from petroleum

Xylene is widely used in industry but requires proper handling due to its flammability and potential health effects from prolonged exposure. It's commonly found in many household and industrial products.

Is this the chemical you were asking about, or were you referring to something else?
