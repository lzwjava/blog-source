For potato slices in an air fryer (about 0.5–1 cm thick), here's what actually works best in practice:

| Situation | Recommended time & temp | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------|
| Raw potato slices, no pre-soaking/boiling, just oil + seasoning | 15–20 minutes at 200°C (400°F) | Shake the basket every 5–7 minutes. They come out crispy outside, cooked inside. 20 minutes is usually perfect for slightly thicker slices. |
| You soak the slices in sauce/marinade first (e.g., soy sauce, garlic, herbs, etc.) | 18–25 minutes at 190–200°C | Sauce adds moisture → needs a couple extra minutes. Still shake halfway. If the sauce has sugar (BBQ, honey, etc.), drop to 180–190°C the last 5 minutes to avoid burning. |
| You want them very crispy (like chips) | 20–25 minutes at 200°C, flip/shake twice | Thinner slices (3–4 mm) can be done in 12–15 min. |

Your original plan (20 minutes at 200°C) is actually spot-on for most cases, even with sauce soaking.

Quick best-practice tips for perfect results:
- Pat the slices dry after soaking in sauce (or the outside stays soft)
- Lightly spray with oil even if the sauce already has oil
- Don’t overcrowd the basket — single layer is key
- Preheat the air fryer 3–5 minutes if your model allows

So: stick with your 20 minutes at 200°C → you’ll get nicely browned, fully cooked potato slices with good texture. If they look pale at 18 minutes, just give them 2–4 more minutes. No need for half an hour unless the slices are very thick (>1.5 cm).

Enjoy your air-fried potatoes! 🥔
