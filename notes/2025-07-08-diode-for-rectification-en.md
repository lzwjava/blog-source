The semiconductor device primarily used for rectification in DC power supplies is the **Diode**.

Here's an explanation of all the options:

* **BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor):**
    * **Explanation:** A BJT is a three-terminal semiconductor device (emitter, base, collector) that can amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It's called "bipolar" because its operation depends on two types of charge carriers: electrons and holes. A small current applied to the base controls a much larger current between the collector and emitter.
    * **Role in DC power supplies:** While BJTs can be used in some power supply circuits for voltage regulation or switching, their primary function is not rectification. They are primarily used for amplification and switching in various electronic circuits.

* **Diode:**
    * **Explanation:** A diode is a two-terminal semiconductor device that acts like a one-way valve for electric current. It allows current to flow easily in one direction (forward bias) but blocks it in the opposite direction (reverse bias). Most diodes are made from silicon and have an anode (positive lead) and a cathode (negative lead).
    * **Role in DC power supplies:** This is the correct answer. Diodes are fundamental components in rectifier circuits. They are used to convert alternating current (AC) into pulsating direct current (DC) by allowing only one half-cycle of the AC waveform to pass through (half-wave rectification) or by converting both half-cycles into DC (full-wave rectification, often using a bridge rectifier made of four diodes). This is the essential first step in a DC power supply to get a usable DC voltage from an AC source.

* **Op-Amp (Operational Amplifier):**
    * **Explanation:** An op-amp is an integrated circuit (IC) that is a high-gain, DC-coupled electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input and a single-ended output. Its name comes from its original use in performing mathematical operations in analog computers. Op-amps are extremely versatile and, with external components, can be configured for a wide range of applications like amplifiers, buffers, comparators, filters, and more.
    * **Role in DC power supplies:** Op-amps are not used for rectification. While they might be part of more advanced regulated DC power supplies (e.g., in feedback loops for voltage regulation), they don't perform the AC-to-DC conversion directly.

* **Transistor:**
    * **Explanation:** "Transistor" is a broad term that encompasses various semiconductor devices, including BJTs and FETs (Field-Effect Transistors). In general, a transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It has at least three terminals, where a small voltage or current applied to one pair of terminals controls the current through another pair.
    * **Role in DC power supplies:** While transistors are integral to modern electronics and are used in power supplies for voltage regulation, switching, and other control functions, the term "transistor" itself is too general to specifically identify the primary device for rectification. Diodes are a specific type of semiconductor device whose primary function includes rectification. If "Transistor" were to refer to a specific type of switching transistor in a switched-mode power supply, that would be a different application than the basic rectification process.

Therefore, the **Diode** is the semiconductor device primarily used for rectification in DC power supplies.
