For database ranking indices, here are the most reliable sources that track the popularity of database management systems (DBMS) based on various metrics like search volume, community engagement, and job market demand:

1. **DB-Engines Ranking**  
   - **Website**: [db-engines.com](https://www.db-engines.com/en/ranking)  
   - **Description**: The DB-Engines Ranking is a leading monthly index that ranks over 400 DBMS, including relational, NoSQL, and graph databases. It measures popularity using parameters like search engine results (Google and Bing), Google Trends, Stack Overflow and DBA Stack Exchange discussions, job offers (Indeed and Simply Hired), and social media mentions. As of June 2024, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server were the top three. It also provides historical trends and category-specific rankings (e.g., graph DBMS).[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Engines_ranking)[](https://www.statista.com/statistics/809750/worldwide-popularity-ranking-database-management-systems/)[](https://www.red-gate.com/blog/db-engines-shares-q1-2025-database-industry-rankings-and-top-climbers-snowflake-and-postgresql-trending)

2. **TOPDB Top Database Index**  
   - **Website**: [pypl.github.io/TOPDB](https://pypl.github.io/TOPDB.html)  
   - **Description**: Similar to the PYPL Index for programming languages, the TOPDB Index ranks databases based on Google search frequency for database-related terms, assuming higher search volume indicates popularity. It’s a simple, leading indicator updated monthly, with data available for specific countries.[](https://pypl.github.io/DB.html)

3. **Red9 Database Rankings**  
   - **Website**: [red9.com](https://red9.com/db-engines-rankings-2025/)  
   - **Description**: Red9 provides monthly DBMS rankings using a weighted algorithm that analyzes data from sources like Amazon book searches, online mentions, and other metrics. It emphasizes current trends and includes charts and tables for easy comparison.[](https://red9.com/database-popularity-ranking/)

4. **Stack Overflow Developer Survey**  
   - **Website**: [survey.stackoverflow.co](https://survey.stackoverflow.co)  
   - **Description**: This annual survey ranks databases based on developer usage and preference. In 2024, PostgreSQL (48.7%), MySQL (40.3%), and SQLite (33.1%) were the top three databases among developers, reflecting real-world adoption.

5. **benchANT Database Ranking**  
   - **Website**: [benchant.com](https://benchant.com/database-ranking)  
   - **Description**: Focused on performance and cost, benchANT ranks SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL databases using benchmarks like YCSB and TSBS. It evaluates throughput and latency for workloads like general-purpose (50% read/write), OLTP, and time-series data. This is ideal for performance-driven comparisons but less about popularity.[](https://benchant.com/ranking/database-ranking)

These sources differ in focus: DB-Engines and TOPDB emphasize popularity, Stack Overflow reflects developer usage, and benchANT prioritizes performance. For the most comprehensive view, DB-Engines is the go-to due to its broad metrics and frequent updates. If you’re interested in a specific type of database (e.g., NoSQL or relational) or metric (e.g., performance vs. popularity), let me know, and I can recommend the best source!
