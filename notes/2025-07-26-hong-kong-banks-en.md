### Major International Banks in Hong Kong

Hong Kong is a major financial hub with a mix of local and international banks. Some of the prominent international banks operating there include:

- **HSBC Hong Kong** (The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation): One of the largest, offering a wide range of personal and international banking services.
- **Standard Chartered Hong Kong**: A British multinational bank with strong presence in Asia, providing debit, credit, and multi-currency options.
- **Citibank Hong Kong**: A U.S.-based bank focused on global banking, wealth management, and cards for expats and non-residents.
- **DBS Bank (Hong Kong)**: Singapore-based, known for digital banking and services tailored to cross-border needs.
- **Bank of America**: U.S. bank with correspondent services, though more limited for personal accounts.
- **JPMorgan Chase Bank**: Another U.S. player, primarily for high-net-worth and corporate clients.
- Other notable ones include Bank of China (Hong Kong) – which has strong ties to mainland China – and Hang Seng Bank (a subsidiary of HSBC).

These banks often cater to non-residents, including mainland Chinese citizens, but requirements vary based on the type of account or card.

### Other Cards You Can Have as a Mainland Chinese Citizen in Guangzhou

Since you already have an HSBC HK debit card (which you obtained by visiting Hong Kong with your entry permit), you can explore similar options from other banks. As a non-resident mainland Chinese citizen, you're eligible to open personal bank accounts and get debit or credit cards in Hong Kong, but you typically need to be physically present in Hong Kong during the application process (using your Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao, often called the "pass" or "permit"). Remote options are limited but improving, especially for Greater Bay Area residents like those in Guangzhou.

Here's what you can consider:

- **Debit Cards from Other Banks**:
  - **Bank of China (Hong Kong) (BOCHK)**: Easy for mainland Chinese; you can open an account via their mobile app (BOC Mobile Banking) while in Hong Kong. They offer debit cards with UnionPay, Visa, or Mastercard networks. Requirements: Mainland ID card, valid entry permit, and proof of address (e.g., a utility bill from Guangzhou).
  - **Standard Chartered Hong Kong**: Offers multi-currency Mastercard debit cards. Non-residents can apply in-branch with your passport/ID and entry permit.
  - **Citibank Hong Kong**: Provides Debit Mastercard. Foreigners/non-residents can apply, but you may need proof of income or employment.
  - **ZA Bank or WeLab Bank**: Virtual banks that allow mainland visitors to open accounts quickly via app if you're 18+, in Hong Kong, and have your mainland ID card. They issue debit cards (e.g., ZA Card or livi Debit Mastercard) with low barriers – no minimum balance often required.
  - **ICBC (Asia)**: Offers Greater Bay Area account opening services; you can apply with your mainland ID and entry permit for a debit card.

- **Credit Cards**:
  - These are trickier for non-residents as banks often require proof of income (e.g., salary slips), a Hong Kong address (or mainland equivalent), and sometimes employment in Hong Kong. However, some banks are more flexible for mainland Chinese due to cross-border initiatives.
  - Options include cards from HSBC (you could upgrade your existing account to include a credit card), Standard Chartered, Citibank, DBS, or BOCHK. For example, BOCHK's Great Wall International Credit Card supports multiple currencies and is accessible to mainland residents.
  - Limits might start low (e.g., HKD 10,000–50,000), and approval isn't guaranteed – rejections are common without strong ties to Hong Kong.

- **General Tips for Other Cards**:
  - Visit Hong Kong branches during your trip (using the same entry permit process).
  - Bring: Mainland Resident Identity Card, valid entry permit, passport (if applicable), proof of address (Guangzhou utility bill or residence proof), and income documents for credit cards.
  - Digital banks like ZA or WeLab are the easiest for quick debit cards – accounts can be opened in minutes via app while in Hong Kong.
  - Avoid purely online applications from mainland China; most require in-person verification due to anti-money laundering rules.
  - If you're in the Greater Bay Area, look into cross-border services from banks like ICBC or BOCHK, which allow easier transfers between mainland and Hong Kong accounts.

### How to Get a Hong Kong Visa Card

A "Hong Kong Visa card" likely refers to a Visa-branded debit or credit card issued by a Hong Kong bank (Visa is a payment network, not a bank). Most major banks in Hong Kong issue Visa cards, and as a mainland Chinese citizen, you can apply similarly to how you got your HSBC debit card.

- **Steps to Apply**:
  1. **Prepare Documents**: Mainland ID card, valid Exit-Entry Permit (your "pass ticket"), proof of address (e.g., Guangzhou residence proof), and for credit cards: income proof (e.g., bank statements or salary slips showing stable income).
  2. **Visit Hong Kong**: You must be physically in Hong Kong for most applications (same as your HSBC experience). Use your entry permit to travel from Guangzhou – it's a short trip via high-speed rail or ferry.
  3. **Choose a Bank and Apply**:
     - **For Debit Visa Card**: Easier for non-residents. Banks like BOCHK, HSBC (you could get an additional Visa debit if needed), or Citibank issue them. Apply in-branch or via app (e.g., BOCHK's mobile account opening for mainland visitors).
     - **For Credit Visa Card**: Apply through issuers like BOCHK (e.g., BOC Visa Card), China Construction Bank (Asia), DBS, Hang Seng, HSBC, or Standard Chartered. Go to a branch or use online portals if available. Approval may take 1–2 weeks and requires a credit check.
     - Virtual banks like ZA may offer Visa-linked cards with minimal hassle.
  4. **Submit Application**: In-branch is safest; provide documents and explain your needs (e.g., for international use). Some banks allow pre-application online but require in-person ID verification.
  5. **Activation and Use**: Once approved, the card is mailed to your provided address (can be mainland) or picked up. Use it for global payments, but note currency conversion fees.

- **Challenges and Notes**:
  - Credit cards may require a minimum income (e.g., HKD 150,000 annual) and could be declined if you lack Hong Kong ties. Start with debit if credit is rejected.
  - Since March 2025, Hong Kong banks can issue cards for use in mainland China more easily, which might benefit you.
  - Fees: Annual fees for credit cards (HKD 300–2,000), but many waive for the first year. Debit cards often have no annual fee.
  - If denied, try banks with mainland affiliations like BOCHK.

If you face issues, consider consulting the bank directly or a financial advisor in Hong Kong. Always check for updates, as regulations can change.
