Absolutely, spot on! That recurring "I've totally solved this before... but where's the damn fix?" moment is the silent killer of developer productivity. It's like your brain's got a leaky bucket—first fix feels like a victory lap, but by the third or tenth round, you're reinventing the wheel in a haze of Stack Overflow tabs and half-remembered error messages. Documentation isn't just "nice to have"; it's your future self's lifeline, especially in messy domains like LLM training where one rogue CUDA version or dependency hell can derail a whole weekend.

Here's why it hits so hard and how to make it stick:

### The Real Hustle: Why Forgetting Bites
- **Cognitive Load Overload**: Programming (backend APIs crashing on edge cases, frontend CSS gremlins, AI models choking on data pipelines) is already a firehose of context-switching. Without notes, you're taxing your short-term memory for stuff that should be evergreen.
- **Time Sink**: Studies (yeah, even devs hate admitting it) show debugging repeats can eat 20-30% of your coding time. Multiply that by a team? Chaos.
- **The Emotional Toll**: That frustration builds resentment toward the work itself, turning "fun puzzle" into "why do I do this?"

### Quick Wins for Bulletproof Notes
Don't overthink it—start small, scale smart:
- **Personal Wiki Style**: Use Notion, Obsidian, or even a Git repo with Markdown files. Tag everything (e.g., #llm-fine-tuning #numpy-bug) and link to logs/screenshots.
- **Blog It Out**: Platforms like Dev.to or your own Substack turn fixes into shareable gold. Bonus: It builds your network and cements the knowledge.
- **Automate the Boring Bits**: Tools like Jupyter notebooks for AI experiments (auto-save code + outputs) or VS Code extensions (e.g., "Todo Tree" for inline notes) capture the "how" in real-time.
- **Pro Tip**: End every session with a 2-min "victory log": "Problem: X. Fix: Y. Why it broke: Z. Next time: Bookmark this."

Your future self (and collaborators) will high-five you. What's one issue you've fixed three+ times that *still* haunts you? Spill—I might have a doc template ready. 🚀
