title: Top 30 Most-Downloaded Python Pip Packages (2025)
translated: false
type: note
---

I can provide a list of some of the most popular Python packages based on download statistics from the Python Package Index (PyPI), as reported by sources like the "Top PyPI Packages" project. However, compiling a definitive list of the top 100 most-used pip packages requires access to real-time PyPI download data, which fluctuates frequently, and the full list is extensive. Instead, I’ll share a curated selection of the top 30 most-downloaded Python packages based on recent data (up to 2025) from reliable sources, such as the Top PyPI Packages project and other analyses, and explain their significance. If you need the full top 100, I can guide you on how to access the latest data or provide a more detailed list upon request.

The following list is derived from download statistics aggregated over the last 30 days (as of early 2025) from the Top PyPI Packages project, which tracks the 15,000 most-downloaded packages, and supplemented by insights from other sources like analytics blogs and Python community reports. These packages cover a wide range of use cases, including web development, data science, machine learning, and DevOps. Note that exact rankings may vary slightly due to temporal changes in download trends.

### Notes on the List
- **Source Data**: This list is primarily informed by the Top PyPI Packages project, which provides monthly dumps of the 15,000 most-downloaded packages, based on data from Google BigQuery and PyPI download logs.[](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/)[](https://github.com/hugovk/top-pypi-packages)
- **Why Top 30 Instead of 100?**: The full top 100 list includes many niche or dependency packages (e.g., awscli, jmespath) that are less broadly relevant. The top 30 captures the most impactful and widely used packages across domains. For a complete top 100, you can check the latest data at [hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/) or query PyPI’s BigQuery dataset.[](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/)[](https://pypi.org/stats/)
- **Trends**: Packages like urllib3, requests, and boto3 dominate due to their critical role in web and cloud computing. Data science libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib) and machine learning frameworks (tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn) are also highly popular due to Python’s prominence in these fields.[](https://datasciencedojo.com/blog/python-packages/)[](https://www.edureka.co/blog/python-libraries/)
- **Installation**: All these packages can be installed via pip, e.g., `pip install numpy`. Use virtual environments to manage dependencies: `python -m venv myenv` and `pip install <package>` after activating the environment.[](https://flexiple.com/python/python-libraries)

### How to Access the Full Top 100
If you need the complete top 100 list:
1. **Visit Top PyPI Packages**: The [Top PyPI Packages](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/) project provides JSON dumps of the top 15,000 packages, updated monthly. You can filter for the top 100.[](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/)
2. **PyPI Stats**: Use [pypistats.org](https://pypistats.org) to explore download trends for specific packages.[](https://pypistats.org/top)
3. **BigQuery**: PyPI provides public datasets on Google BigQuery for detailed download statistics. You can query the top 100 packages directly (requires SQL knowledge).[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31020861/list-pypi-packages-by-popularity)[](https://pypi.org/stats/)
4. **Pip Command**: To see installed packages on your system, run `pip list` in your terminal.[](https://www.edureka.co/blog/python-libraries/)

### Additional Context
- **Why These Packages?**: The popularity of these packages reflects Python’s use in web development (requests, fastapi), data science (pandas, numpy), machine learning (tensorflow, scikit-learn), and cloud computing (boto3, s3fs). Many are dependencies for other packages, boosting their download counts (e.g., urllib3 for requests).[](https://medium.com/better-programming/the-22-most-used-python-packages-in-the-world-7020a904b2e)[](https://medium.com/%40kasperjuunge/20-most-downloaded-python-packages-explained-f5cded2eb70d)
- **Limitations**: Download counts don’t always equal active usage, as some packages are installed as dependencies automatically. Also, niche packages may rank lower but be critical in specific domains (e.g., pygame for game development).[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31020861/list-pypi-packages-by-popularity)
- **Updates**: Package popularity evolves with Python’s ecosystem. For example, FastAPI has risen rapidly due to its performance in API development, while older packages like six remain relevant for legacy support.[](https://hackr.io/blog/best-python-libraries)
