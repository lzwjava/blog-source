Yes, that's correct. Claude Code, Anthropic's terminal-based coding tool, offers two primary login methods:

- **Claude account with subscription**: This uses your existing Claude.ai subscription (starting at $20/month for Pro or $100/month for Max), providing predictable pricing and access included in those plans.
- **Anthropic Console account**: This bills based on API usage, requiring you to set up billing in the Anthropic Console for pay-as-you-go token consumption.

You can select the method during login, and the tool supports switching or restricting methods via settings if needed.
