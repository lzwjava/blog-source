A **Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL)** is a type of financing provided mainly by international financial institutions like the **World Bank** to countries that are facing severe balance-of-payments problems or economic crises. It’s less about traditional commercial banking and more about **development and policy lending**.

Here’s a breakdown:

### Purpose

The main goal of an SAL is not just to provide money but to support a country’s **economic reform program**. The funds are intended to stabilize the economy, restore growth, and ensure that the country can meet its international financial obligations.

### Conditions

Unlike a normal bank loan, a structural adjustment loan comes with **policy conditionalities**. The borrowing government agrees to implement certain reforms such as:

* **Fiscal discipline**: reducing government deficits and subsidies.
* **Trade liberalization**: lowering tariffs and removing import restrictions.
* **Monetary reforms**: controlling inflation, interest rate adjustments.
* **Privatization**: selling off inefficient state-owned enterprises.
* **Structural changes**: improving governance, deregulation, and encouraging private sector growth.

These conditions are meant to “adjust” the structure of the economy, hence the name.

### Repayment

* SALs are usually **medium- to long-term loans** with concessional interest rates (lower than market rates).
* Repayment schedules are structured to give the country breathing space while reforms take hold.

### Criticism

SALs have been controversial:

* Supporters argue they help countries modernize and re-enter global markets.
* Critics say the reforms can be **harsh on citizens** (e.g., cutting subsidies on food, healthcare, education), leading to social unrest and inequality.

✅ In short: A structural adjustment loan is a **policy-based loan** from international lenders, tied to **economic reform conditions**, designed to help a country stabilize its economy and return to sustainable growth.

Would you like me to also explain how **SALs differ from a regular project loan** (which finances a specific dam, road, or factory), so you can see the distinction more clearly?
