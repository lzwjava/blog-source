Your PC is a high-performance machine with an Intel Core i9-13900KF, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070, 64GB DDR5 RAM, and ample storage, making it ideal for a variety of tasks beyond casual use. Since it’s idle 80% of the time, you can maximize its potential by repurposing it for computationally intensive or always-on tasks. Here are several options to consider, including setting up a server and other productive uses, tailored to your hardware’s capabilities:

### 1. Set Up a Home Server
Turning your PC into a server is a great way to utilize its power for continuous, remote-access tasks. Here are some server types you can set up:

#### a. Media Server (Plex or Jellyfin)
- **Purpose**: Stream movies, TV shows, music, or personal media to devices at home or remotely.
- **Why it fits**: Your RTX 4070 supports hardware-accelerated video encoding/decoding (NVENC/NVDEC), making it excellent for transcoding 4K media. The 2TB HDD is ideal for storing large media libraries, and the 1TB SSD can cache frequently accessed files.
- **Setup**:
  1. Install Plex Media Server or Jellyfin (open-source alternative) on your PC.
  2. Configure your media library on the HDD.
  3. Set up port forwarding on your router for remote access (e.g., Plex uses port 32400).
  4. Use the i9’s multi-core performance for smooth transcoding of multiple streams.
- **Resource Usage**: Low CPU usage for direct streaming, moderate for transcoding. GPU handles most transcoding tasks efficiently.
- **Access**: Use apps on phones, TVs, or browsers to access your media anywhere.

#### b. File Server (NAS-like with Nextcloud or TrueNAS)
- **Purpose**: Host a personal cloud for file storage, sharing, and backups, similar to Google Drive or Dropbox.
- **Why it fits**: The 2TB HDD and 1TB SSD provide ample storage, and the i9’s processing power ensures fast file transfers. Your 2.5Gbps LAN and Wi-Fi 6E support quick network access.
- **Setup**:
  1. Install Nextcloud or TrueNAS on your PC (TrueNAS Scale is Linux-based and supports containers).
  2. Configure storage pools (HDD for bulk storage, SSD for quick access).
  3. Set up user accounts and share links for family or colleagues.
  4. Enable HTTPS and port forwarding for secure remote access.
- **Resource Usage**: Low CPU and RAM usage for file serving; SSD speeds up access.
- **Access**: Access files via web browser, desktop clients, or mobile apps.

#### c. Game Server (Minecraft, Valheim, etc.)
- **Purpose**: Host private game servers for you and friends.
- **Why it fits**: The i9-13900KF’s 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) and 64GB RAM can handle multiple game servers or large player counts. The SSD ensures fast world loading.
- **Setup**:
  1. Choose a game (e.g., Minecraft, Valheim, ARK: Survival Evolved).
  2. Install server software (e.g., Minecraft Java Edition server or Steam-based server tools).
  3. Configure port forwarding (e.g., Minecraft uses port 25565).
  4. Optimize server settings for your 24-core CPU and high RAM.
- **Resource Usage**: Moderate CPU and RAM usage, depending on player count and game complexity.
- **Access**: Friends connect via your public IP or a domain name.

#### d. Web Server or Development Server
- **Purpose**: Host websites, APIs, or a development environment for coding projects.
- **Why it fits**: The i9 and 64GB RAM can handle multiple virtual machines or containers (e.g., Docker) for testing web apps. The RTX 4070 can accelerate AI/ML development tasks.
- **Setup**:
  1. Install a web server stack (e.g., Nginx/Apache, Node.js, or Python Flask/Django).
  2. Use Docker or Podman to run isolated services.
  3. Set up a domain name (via services like Cloudflare) and port forwarding for external access.
  4. Optionally, use the server for local development (e.g., testing web apps or APIs).
- **Resource Usage**: Low to moderate CPU/RAM for lightweight websites; higher for complex apps.
- **Access**: Host public or private websites, accessible via browser.

#### e. VPN Server
- **Purpose**: Create a secure VPN to access your home network remotely or bypass geo-restrictions.
- **Why it fits**: The i9 ensures fast encryption/decryption, and your network hardware supports high-speed connections.
- **Setup**:
  1. Install OpenVPN or WireGuard on your PC.
  2. Configure VPN settings and port forwarding.
  3. Set up clients on your phone, laptop, or other devices.

### Recommendations for Maximizing Use
1. **Combine Tasks**: Run a media server, file server, and VPN simultaneously using containers (Docker) or VMs to isolate services. Your 64GB RAM and 24 cores support multitasking.
2. **Optimize Power Usage**: Since your GPU is at 12W/215W in P8 state, enable power-saving modes when running lightweight server tasks to reduce electricity costs.
3. **Security**: For external access (e.g., web or file server), use strong passwords, HTTPS, and a firewall. Consider a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) and Cloudflare for added security.
4. **Operating System**: Use Linux (e.g., Ubuntu Server) for lightweight server tasks to reduce overhead compared to Windows. Your `nvidia-smi` output suggests you’re already on Linux.
5. **Monitoring**: Install tools like Netdata or Grafana to monitor CPU, GPU, and network usage to ensure optimal performance.

### Suggested Starting Point
Given your hardware and interest in a server, start with a **media server (Plex/Jellyfin)** and a **file server (Nextcloud)**. These are beginner-friendly, utilize your storage and GPU, and provide immediate value for personal use. If you’re tech-savvy, set up **Proxmox** to run multiple services in VMs or containers, allowing flexibility to experiment with other tasks (e.g., game server, AI development).

### Notes
- **Internet Speed**: Ensure your home internet has sufficient upload speed for external server access (e.g., streaming or file sharing). Wi-Fi 6E and 2.5Gbps LAN help with local performance.
- **Cooling**: Your GPU at 43°C and 0% fan speed is excellent for idle. Monitor temps during heavy tasks (e.g., mining or rendering) using tools like `nvidia-smi` or HWMonitor.
- **Learning Curve**: Some options (e.g., Proxmox, AI development) require technical knowledge. Start with user-friendly options like Plex or Nextcloud if you’re new to servers.
