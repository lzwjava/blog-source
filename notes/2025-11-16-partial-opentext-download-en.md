title: Partial OpenWebText Download Explained
translated: false
type: note

Short answer: **No, it does NOT download the entire OpenWebText.** It only fetches the slice you request. And yes, you can see download progress — Hugging Face shows it automatically unless you suppress logs.

Here’s the breakdown:

---

## Does `load_dataset("openwebtext", split="train[:10000]")` download the full dataset?

**It downloads only the shards needed for that slice, not the full corpus.**

OpenWebText on Hugging Face is stored in *multiple shards* (e.g., dozens of `.jsonl.zst` files). When you load only the first 10,000 rows, the library downloads just enough shards to cover those examples.
It does **not** download all shards.

So the download is proportional to the amount of data you actually load.

---

## How to see its download progress

You normally see console progress bars like:

```
Downloading (…)arrow…: 100%
Downloading (…)nload: 100%
Extracting…: 100%
Generating train split…: 100%
```

If logs are suppressed or you want more visibility, use:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
import datasets

datasets.logging.set_verbosity_info()

dataset = load_dataset("openwebtext", split="train[:10000]")
```

This ensures progress bars always show.

---

## How to see **how much** it downloaded

After loading:

```python
dataset._info
```

or:

```python
dataset.info
```

Also, Hugging Face stores files under:

```
~/.cache/huggingface/datasets/
```

You can check disk usage with:

```bash
du -sh ~/.cache/huggingface/datasets
```

---

## Optional: force verbose debug logs

If you want extremely detailed logs:

```python
datasets.logging.set_verbosity_debug()
```

---

## Why this matters for NanoGPT

NanoGPT’s training snippets use:

```python
dataset = load_dataset("openwebtext", split="train[:10000]")
```

to avoid huge downloads during testing.
Good news: the behavior matches exactly what you want — **fast, partial download**.
