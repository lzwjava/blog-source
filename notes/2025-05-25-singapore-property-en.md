In Singapore, the ability of immigrant workers or IT workers to buy a house and their perceptions of housing costs depend on their specific circumstances, including their income levels, residency status, and the type of property they are seeking. Below, I address the two groups separately based on available information and general trends, focusing on whether they purchase homes and if they find them expensive, while incorporating relevant insights from the provided context.

### Immigrant Workers (Low-Wage Migrant Workers)
**Do They Buy Houses?**
Low-wage migrant workers, such as those in construction, marine shipyards, or domestic work, typically do not buy houses in Singapore. Several factors contribute to this:
- **Residency and Work Permit Restrictions**: Most low-wage migrant workers hold Work Permits, which are temporary and tied to specific employers. These permits restrict their ability to stay long-term in Singapore or apply for permanent residency (PR), a prerequisite for purchasing most types of property, such as Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats.[](https://www.forvismazars.com/sg/en/insights/singapore-publications/doing-business-in-singapore/employment-immigration)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Singapore)
- **Financial Constraints**: Migrant workers often earn low wages, ranging from S$250 to S$1,000 per month, and face high recruitment fees (S$2,000–S$12,000), which can take years to repay. For example, a Bangladeshi worker might earn US$860 monthly, compared to a doctor in Bangladesh earning US$1,559, leaving little disposable income for major investments like property. Additionally, expenses such as levies (S$950/month) and dormitory costs (S$350/month) further limit their financial capacity.[](https://newnaratif.com/myths-and-facts-migrant-workers-in-singapore/)[](https://blog.seedly.sg/insights-migrant-worker-issue-perspectives-subcontractor/)[](https://blog.seedly.sg/insights-migrant-worker-issue-perspectives-subcontractor/)
- **Intent and Circumstances**: Many migrant workers view their time in Singapore as temporary, aiming to earn money to send home or invest in their home countries. For instance, one worker saved enough over years to buy a three-story mansion in Bangladesh. The restrictive conditions of their work permits, such as prohibitions on marrying Singaporeans or bringing family, also discourage long-term settlement or property purchase.[](https://blog.seedly.sg/insights-migrant-worker-issue-perspectives-subcontractor/)[](https://www.thedailybeast.com/singapores-exploited-immigrant-workers/)[](https://www.imi.gov.my/index.php/en/main-services/foreign-worker/)

**Do They Complain About Housing Costs?**
There is little evidence that low-wage migrant workers complain about housing costs in the context of purchasing property, as homeownership is generally not their goal. Instead, their concerns focus on:
- **Living Conditions**: Migrant workers often live in crowded dormitories with poor conditions, such as “dirty and cramped sleeping areas” or “rat-infested” accommodations, which have been criticized by NGOs and highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic when 82.4% of cases were among dormitory residents. Complaints center on these substandard living conditions rather than the cost of purchasing homes.[](https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/singapore-immigration-and-changing-public-policies/)[](https://weai.columbia.edu/news/migrant-workers-rights-singapore-advocacy-legal-frameworks-and-prospects-change)
- **Rental Costs**: For those renting, the high cost of living in Singapore, including rent, is a challenge. However, their employers often cover dormitory costs, and personal expenses (e.g., S$130/month for food and transport) are kept minimal to save money. Thus, complaints about housing costs are more about affordability of basic living expenses than property prices.[](https://newnaratif.com/myths-and-facts-migrant-workers-in-singapore/)

### IT Workers (Skilled Professionals)
**Do They Buy Houses?**
IT workers, often classified as skilled professionals, are more likely to buy houses in Singapore, particularly if they hold Employment Passes (EP) or S Passes, which are for mid- to high-skilled workers. Key points include:
- **Eligibility**: EP holders, who must earn at least S$5,600/month (S$6,200 for financial services as of 2025), can apply for permanent residency after meeting criteria like six months of payslips and three years of tax assessments. PRs can purchase HDB flats (after a 5-year Minimum Occupation Period for resale flats) or private properties like condominiums without the restrictions faced by non-residents.[](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/4/11/singapore-tightens-rules-for-expat-workers-with-eye-on-locals-gripes)[](https://www.forvismazars.com/sg/en/insights/singapore-publications/doing-business-in-singapore/employment-immigration)[](https://www.william-russell.com/blog/expat-cost-of-living-singapore/)
- **Financial Capacity**: IT workers typically earn high salaries, with mid-level managers averaging S$9,490/month (US$7,000) in 2024, making property purchase feasible. Singapore’s lenient tax rates (capped at 22%) allow them to retain more income, supporting major investments like housing.[](https://www.william-russell.com/blog/expat-cost-of-living-singapore/)[](https://www.william-russell.com/blog/expat-cost-of-living-singapore/)
- **Market Trends**: Foreigners, including IT workers, can buy private properties (e.g., condominiums over 10 years old) but face restrictions on new HDB flats unless married to a Singaporean citizen. The high property prices—averaging US$14,373 per square meter in 2022—mean that only well-paid IT workers or those with significant savings can afford to buy. For example, expats often opt for flat-sharing to reduce costs, with rooms available from US$700/month.[](https://www.william-russell.com/blog/expat-cost-of-living-singapore/)[](https://www.william-russell.com/blog/expat-cost-of-living-singapore/)[](https://www.william-russell.com/blog/expat-cost-of-living-singapore/)

**Do They Complain About Housing Costs?**
Yes, IT workers and expatriates in general often find Singapore’s housing market expensive, contributing to broader discontent:
- **High Property Prices**: Singapore’s property prices are among the highest in Asia, behind only Hong Kong and Japan. The cost of rent is 181% higher than in the UK, and buying property is a significant financial burden, even for high earners. This has led to complaints among locals and foreigners alike, with Singaporeans attributing rising housing costs to immigration in the 2011 elections.[](https://www.william-russell.com/blog/expat-cost-of-living-singapore/)[](https://www.william-russell.com/blog/expat-cost-of-living-singapore/)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Singapore)
- **Public Sentiment**: Surveys indicate that over 60% of Singaporeans believe immigration policies contribute to overcrowding, rising property prices, and job competition, sentiments likely shared by expatriate IT workers facing similar costs. For example, a 2011 online campaign highlighted tensions over cultural differences and housing costs, with locals rallying against perceived favoritism toward foreigners.[](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-11100813)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Singapore)[](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26832115)
- **Discrimination in Rentals**: Some IT workers, particularly those of Indian or Chinese descent, face rental discrimination, with landlords citing stereotypes about property upkeep or cooking smells, which adds to the perception of an expensive and unwelcoming housing market.[](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26832115)

### Summary
- **Low-Wage Migrant Workers**: These workers rarely buy houses due to financial constraints, temporary work permits, and a focus on earning money for their home countries. Complaints focus on poor living conditions in dormitories rather than the cost of purchasing homes.
- **IT Workers**: Skilled IT workers, especially those with PR status, are more likely to buy properties, particularly private condominiums, due to higher salaries. However, they often complain about the high cost of housing, with property prices and rents significantly impacting their cost of living, a sentiment echoed in broader public discontent about immigration-driven price increases.
