You're absolutely right—the sheer volume of products, apps, books, and services available today can feel overwhelming. The paradox of choice often leads to decision fatigue, wasted time, and even regret. Here’s a structured approach to navigating this overload:

### 1. **Define Your Goals and Priorities**
   - Ask: *What problem am I trying to solve?* or *What value am I seeking?* (e.g., learning, productivity, entertainment).
   - Focus only on things that align with your current goals. Ignore the rest—even if they’re "good."

### 2. **Use Filters to Narrow Options**
   - **For apps/tools:** Rely on trusted curators (like *Product Hunt* for tech, *The Sweet Setup* for apps) or niche communities (e.g., Reddit’s r/books for book recommendations).
   - **For books:** Prioritize classics or books repeatedly recommended by experts in the field.
   - **For products:** Check "best of" lists (Wirecutter, Consumer Reports) or crowdsourced reviews (Amazon, Reddit).

### 3. **Time-Box Experimentation**
   - Allocate a fixed time to test a product/app/book (e.g., 30 minutes for an app, 50 pages for a book). If it doesn’t deliver value by then, drop it.
   - Adopt a "fail fast" mindset—quit early if it’s not a fit.

### 4. **Leverage Outsourcing**
   - Delegate research: Use services like *Which?* (UK) or *Wirecutter* (US) for product comparisons.
   - For books, read summaries first (Blinkist, podcasts, or YouTube summaries) to gauge relevance.

### 5. **Adopt Minimalism**
   - Digital tools: Stick to a core set (e.g., Notion + Google Workspace + Zoom) unless a niche need arises.
   - Physical goods: Follow the "one in, one out" rule to avoid clutter.
   - Books: Use libraries or Kindle samples before purchasing.

### 6. **Automate or Streamline Decisions**
   - Subscribe to curated boxes/services (e.g., *Humane* for ethical products, *The StoryGraph* for book recommendations).
   - Set up systems: For example, automatically buy the same brand of household goods unless there’s a compelling reason to switch.

### 7. **Embrace "Good Enough"**
   - Avoid perfectionism. Most mid-tier options (e.g., a B+ app) will suffice unless you’re a power user.
   - Remember: Over-optimizing often has diminishing returns.

### 8. **Limit Input Channels**
   - Reduce exposure to ads/recommendations: Unsubscribe from marketing emails, mute social media influencers, or use ad blockers.
   - Avoid "shopping for fun"—it creates artificial needs.

### 9. **Reflect Regularly**
   - Periodically audit your tools/possessions. Delete unused apps, donate unread books, or cancel subscriptions that no longer serve you.
   - Ask: *Has this significantly improved my life?* If not, let it go.

### 10. **Accept You’ll Miss Out**
   - There will always be better products/books/apps you haven’t tried—and that’s okay. Focus on what you have, not what you don’t.

### Example Workflow for Books:
1. **Goal:** Learn about Stoicism.
2. **Filter:** Search "best Stoicism books Reddit" → *Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius is repeatedly recommended.
3. **Test:** Read free Kindle sample → resonates → buy.
4. **Limit:** Ignore other Stoicism books until you finish this one.

The key is intentionality: consume/use *less*, but make sure what you choose adds real value. Everything else is noise.

You're touching on a real challenge of modern life - the paradox of choice and information overload. With millions of options for everything, the time spent just evaluating what to try can become overwhelming.

Here are some approaches that help:

**Set clear priorities first.** Before looking at options, know what you actually need or want to accomplish. This immediately filters out 90% of irrelevant choices.

**Use trusted filters.** Instead of evaluating everything yourself, rely on curated sources - whether that's recommendations from people whose judgment you trust, established review sites for your specific needs, or communities focused on your interests.

**Embrace "good enough."** The best choice and the perfect choice are often enemies of actually getting something done. A decent book you actually read beats the perfect book that sits on your wishlist.

**Time-box your research.** Give yourself a specific limit - maybe 30 minutes to choose a productivity app or an hour to pick your next book. When time's up, go with your best option.

**Start with what's already working.** Before trying new things, make sure you're fully utilizing what you already have. Often we chase new solutions when we haven't mastered the basics.

**Accept missing out.** You'll never try every good app or read every worthwhile book. That's not failure - that's being human with finite time.

The goal isn't to make perfect choices, but to make reasonably good ones quickly so you can spend more time actually using and enjoying what you pick.
