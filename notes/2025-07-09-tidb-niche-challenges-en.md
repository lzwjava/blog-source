Not necessarily doomed, but TiDB faces significant structural challenges that are difficult to overcome without fundamental changes.

## Why It's Struggling

The core issue is architectural - TiDB is trying to solve Google-scale problems without Google-scale infrastructure. Most companies don't actually need the theoretical benefits of distributed SQL if it comes with massive operational overhead and performance penalties.

## Potential Survival Paths

**Niche Market Focus**: TiDB could succeed in specific scenarios where companies genuinely need massive scale with strong consistency and can afford the operational complexity.

**Managed Service Evolution**: PingCAP is pushing TiDB Cloud heavily, which removes much of the operational burden. If they can make it truly "serverless" and cost-effective, it might find a market.

**Technical Improvements**: They're continuously working on performance optimizations and reducing the coordination overhead, though the fundamental architectural constraints remain.

## The Broader Trend

The real shift in 2025 is toward **pragmatic solutions** rather than distributed-first approaches:

- **Single-node performance** has improved dramatically (modern hardware can handle surprisingly large workloads)
- **Read replicas and caching** solve most scaling needs more simply
- **Microservices architectures** reduce the need for massive monolithic databases
- **Cloud-native managed services** provide scaling without the complexity

TiDB isn't necessarily "doomed," but it's becoming a very niche solution. The market is realizing that distributed SQL often creates more problems than it solves for most use cases. Companies are choosing simpler, more proven approaches unless they have truly exceptional scaling requirements.

The writing is on the wall: if you don't have Google's problems, you probably don't need Google's solutions.
