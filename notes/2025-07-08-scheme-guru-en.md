Guy Lewis Steele Jr. (born October 2, 1954), often known as "The Great Quux," is a highly influential American computer scientist who has significantly shaped the landscape of programming languages. He is particularly renowned for his role in the design and documentation of several prominent languages and technical standards, including C, Common Lisp, Java, and, notably, Scheme.

**Early Life and Education:**
Steele received his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in applied mathematics from Harvard University in 1975. He then continued his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), earning both his Master's degree (M.S.) in 1977 and his Ph.D. in computer science in 1980.

**Contributions to Scheme:**
Steele's involvement with Scheme began in 1975 while he was at MIT, where he collaborated with Gerald Jay Sussman. They initially developed Scheme as a "toy" Lisp interpreter to explore concepts related to Carl Hewitt's theory of actors, an object-oriented computational paradigm. This work led to a series of influential papers known as the "Lambda Papers" (1975-1980), which laid the foundational ideas for Scheme.

Scheme stands out as a dialect of Lisp characterized by its minimalist design philosophy, emphasizing functional programming and recursive algorithms, particularly through its early adoption of lexical scope and required tail call optimization. Steele and Sussman's "Revised Report on Scheme" in 1978 was the first in a series of official language definitions (often humorously abbreviated as R^nRS), which continues to guide the language's evolution. Steele was also a member of the IEEE committee that produced the IEEE Standard for the Scheme Programming Language, IEEE Std 1178-1990.

The language's simplicity and power, derived from its strong connection to the lambda calculus, made it popular in academic and research settings, influencing computer science education and serving as a framework for experimentation by theoreticians.

**Broader Impact and Other Works:**
Beyond Scheme, Steele's career is marked by a diverse range of significant contributions:

* **Common Lisp:** He co-authored the seminal book "Common Lisp the Language" (CLtL), which became the original specification for Common Lisp, a powerful and versatile programming language.
* **Java:** Steele played a crucial role in the development of Java at Sun Microsystems, where he was involved in writing the Java Language Specification.
* **C:** He co-authored "C: A Reference Manual," providing a precise description of the C language, and participated in its ANSI standardization process.
* **Parallel Computing:** At Thinking Machines Corporation, he helped define and promote parallel computing versions of Lisp (*Lisp) and C (C\*). He also led the development of Fortress, a high-performance language designed for scientific computing at Sun Microsystems.
* **Emacs:** Steele designed the original command set for Emacs, a widely used text editor.
* **"Growing a Language"**: His influential 1998 talk "Growing a Language" explored the nature of programming language design and the importance of extensibility.

**Awards and Recognition:**
Guy Steele's exceptional contributions to computer science have been widely recognized. His accolades include:

* ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award (1988)
* ACM Fellow (1994)
* ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Achievement Award (1996)
* Member of the National Academy of Engineering (2001)
* Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2002)
* Dr. Dobb's Excellence in Programming Award (2005)

Guy Steele's legacy is defined by his profound influence on the design, standardization, and understanding of programming languages, making him a truly pivotal figure in the history of computer science.
