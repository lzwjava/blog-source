### **1. The Microcomputer: Origins and Evolution**

#### **What is a Microcomputer?**
A microcomputer is a small, affordable computer built around a microprocessor, integrating CPU, memory, and I/O capabilities. The course begins with an overview of microcomputer systems, rooted in the **Von Neumann architecture** (a CPU, memory for instructions and data, and I/O connected via buses).

#### **History and Discovery**
- **Pre-1970s: Foundations**  
  - The concept of a programmable computer dates to **Charles Babbage**’s Analytical Engine (1830s), though it was never built. **Alan Turing**’s theoretical work (1936) and **John von Neumann**’s 1945 report on the EDVAC formalized the stored-program computer, where instructions and data share memory. This **Von Neumann architecture** became the blueprint for microcomputers.
  - Early computers (e.g., ENIAC, 1945) were massive, using vacuum tubes. The invention of the **transistor** (1947, **John Bardeen**, **Walter Brattain**, **William Shockley** at Bell Labs) and the **integrated circuit** (1958, **Jack Kilby** at Texas Instruments and **Robert Noyce** at Fairchild) enabled compact electronics.

- **1971: The First Microprocessor**  
  - **Who Discovered It?**: **Intel**, specifically engineers **Federico Faggin**, **Ted Hoff**, and **Stan Mazor**, developed the **Intel 4004**, the first microprocessor, released in November 1971.  
  - **Story**: Commissioned by Japanese calculator company Busicom, Intel was tasked with designing a chip for a programmable calculator. Ted Hoff proposed a single, general-purpose chip instead of multiple specialized chips, reducing cost and complexity. Federico Faggin led the design, cramming 2,300 transistors into a 4-bit processor (740 kHz, 12-bit address bus). The 4004 could execute 60,000 instructions per second, a leap for its time.  
  - **Impact**: The 4004 powered the Busicom 141-PF calculator and inspired Intel to market it as a general-purpose processor, birthing the microprocessor industry.

- **1970s: Microcomputer Emergence**  
  - **1974**: Intel’s **8080** (8-bit, 2 MHz) powered the **Altair 8800** (1975, MITS), the first commercially successful microcomputer. Marketed as a kit for hobbyists, it ran **CP/M** (an early OS) and inspired **Bill Gates** and **Paul Allen** to found Microsoft, writing a BASIC interpreter for it.  
  - **1977**: The **Apple II** (Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs), **Commodore PET**, and **TRS-80** made microcomputers accessible to consumers, with keyboards, displays, and software.  
  - **Story**: The Altair’s success came from its open design and coverage in *Popular Electronics*. Hobbyists formed clubs (e.g., Homebrew Computer Club), fostering innovation. Wozniak’s Apple II design prioritized affordability and usability, using the MOS 6502 processor.

- **Course Context**: The course focuses on the **Intel 8086/8088**, introduced in 1978, which powered the **IBM PC** (1981), standardizing microcomputers for business and home use.

#### **Key Figures**
- **Federico Faggin**: Led 4004 design, later co-founded Zilog (Z80 processor).  
- **Ted Hoff**: Conceived the microprocessor concept.  
- **Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore**: Intel founders, drove IC and microprocessor development.  
- **Ed Roberts**: MITS founder, created the Altair 8800.

### **2. The Intel 8086/8088 Microprocessor**

#### **What is It?**
The 8086 (16-bit, 5-10 MHz) and 8088 (8-bit external bus) are microprocessors central to the course, known for their segmented memory model, 1 MB address space, and x86 architecture, which remains dominant today.

#### **History and Discovery**
- **1976-1978: Development**  
  - **Who Discovered It?**: Intel’s team, led by **Stephen Morse** (architecture and instruction set), **Bruce Ravenel** (microcode), and **Jim McKevitt** (project management), designed the 8086, released in June 1978. The 8088 followed in 1979.  
  - **Story**: Intel aimed to leapfrog 8-bit processors (e.g., 8080, Z80) to compete in a growing market. The 8086 was designed as a 16-bit processor with a 20-bit address bus, supporting 1 MB of memory (vs. 64 KB for 8-bit chips). Its instruction set was backward-compatible with the 8080, easing software transitions. The 8088, with an 8-bit external bus, reduced system cost, making it attractive for IBM.  
  - **Challenges**: The 8086’s complexity (29,000 transistors) pushed Intel’s fabrication limits. Its segmented memory model (64 KB segments, offset addressing) was a compromise to balance performance and compatibility.

- **1981: IBM PC Adoption**  
  - **Story**: IBM, entering the PC market, chose the 8088 for its **IBM PC** (model 5150) due to its cost-effectiveness and Intel’s support. The decision was influenced by **Bill Lowe**’s team at IBM’s Boca Raton lab, who prioritized an open architecture using off-the-shelf components. The 8088 ran at 4.77 MHz, and the PC’s success standardized the x86 architecture.  
  - **Impact**: The IBM PC’s open design allowed clones (e.g., Compaq, Dell), fueling the PC industry. Microsoft’s **MS-DOS**, developed for the PC, became the dominant OS.

- **Legacy**: The x86 architecture evolved through the 80286 (1982), 80386 (1985), and modern processors (e muttered, requiring periodic refreshing. Static RAM (SRAM) was faster but costlier.  
  - **ROM**: Stored firmware, with variants like **EPROM** (erasable via UV light, George Perlegos, 1971) and **EEPROM** (electrically erasable, Eli Harari, 1977).  
  - **Course Context**: The course covers memory expansion (e.g., address decoding), critical for 8086 systems with 1 MB address spaces.

#### **Key Figures**

Buses standardize CPU-memory-peripheral communication. The course covers **ISA**, **PCI**, and modern interfaces (**USB**, **SPI**, **I²C**).

#### **History and Discovery**
- **1970s: Early Buses**  
  - The **S-100 bus** (1975, Ed Roberts, MITS) was an early standard for Altair-like systems, adopted by hobbyists.  
  - **Story**: The S-100’s openness fostered a microcomputer ecosystem but lacked standardization.

- **1981: ISA Bus**  
  - **Who?**: IBM, for the IBM PC.  
  - **Story**: Designed for the 8088, the ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) bus supported 8-bit (PC) and 16-bit (PC/AT) cards. Its simplicity and IBM’s market dominance made it a standard, though slow (8 MHz).  
  - **Impact**: Used for expansion cards (e.g., sound, graphics) until the 1990s.

- **1992: PCI Bus**  
  - **Who?**: Intel, with contributions from IBM and Compaq.

  - **Impact**: Evolved into PCIe, used today.

- **Modern Interfaces**  
  - **USB (1996)**: Developed by a consortium (Intel, Microsoft, Compaq, etc.), led by **Ajay Bhatt** at Intel. USB unified peripheral connections with hot-plugging and scalability (1.5 Mbps to 480 Mbps for USB 2.0).  
  - **SPI (1980s)**: Motorola’s serial bus for high-speed, short-distance communication (e.g., SD cards).  
  - **I²C (1982)**: Philips’ two-wire bus for low-speed peripherals (e.g., sensors).
