Sora 2's remarkable realism comes from several major advancements in AI video generation technology, as highlighted in recent reviews and official announcements:

1. **Improved Physics and Motion**: Sora 2 adheres much more closely to real-world physics compared to earlier models. This means objects and characters move and interact in ways that look plausible, reducing the "magical" or unnatural behaviors seen in previous AI-generated videos. For example, if a basketball player misses a shot, the ball now rebounds realistically off the backboard instead of teleporting or behaving unpredictably.

2. **Synchronized Audio and Visuals**: The model generates not just visuals, but also synchronized dialogue, sound effects, and background soundscapes. This integration of audio and video makes the output feel more lifelike and immersive, as the sounds match the actions on screen.

3. **Enhanced Temporal Coherence**: Sora 2 maintains better consistency across frames and shots, reducing flicker and identity drift. This means characters and objects remain stable and recognizable throughout the video, which is crucial for realism.

4. **Multi-Character and Scene Control**: The model offers improved control over multiple characters and complex scenes, allowing for more dynamic and believable storytelling. This is a significant step up from earlier versions, which struggled with maintaining consistency in multi-character interactions.

5. **Sharper Visual Fidelity**: OpenAI emphasizes "sharper realism" in Sora 2, with more accurate textures, lighting, and motion. While it may not yet match the precision of professional camera shoots in all scenarios, it is now capable of producing short-form videos that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real footage.

6. **Hybrid Use Cases**: Many creators are using Sora 2 alongside traditional filming, leveraging AI for rapid ideation and stylized shots, while relying on real cameras for scenes requiring absolute precision or long-form capture.

In summary, Sora 2's realism is the result of better physics simulation, synchronized audio, improved temporal coherence, and more sophisticated control over scenes and characters. However, it's important to note that while Sora 2 is a major leap forward, traditional filming still excels in areas requiring absolute predictability and fine-grained control.
