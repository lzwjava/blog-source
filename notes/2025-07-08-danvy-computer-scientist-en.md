Olivier Danvy is a highly distinguished computer scientist known for his work in programming languages, particularly in the areas of partial evaluation and continuations. He is a French national and currently holds a professorship at Yale-NUS College in Singapore. He also has affiliations with the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore.

Danvy earned his PhD from Université Paris VI in 1986. His career has also included significant time at Aarhus University in Denmark, where he completed a DSc in 2006, and held honorary and adjunct professorships. He has also had visiting positions at various universities in the United States, including Stanford, Indiana, Kansas State, and Carnegie Mellon, and spent time at Xerox PARC and Yale University.

His research interests broadly cover all aspects of programming languages, from their logic and semantics to their implementation. Key specializations include:
* Partial Evaluation
* Continuations
* Abstract Machines
* Logic in Computer Science
* Program Transformations

Danvy is notable for the sheer number of scientific papers that acknowledge his help, with one analysis in *Nature* identifying him as "the most thanked person in computer science." He attributes this to his multidisciplinary approach, extensive travel, involvement in international PhD programs, networking, and affiliation with a department that has a strong tradition of collaborative research. He has supervised over 20 PhD students of various nationalities.

Some of his highly cited publications include:
* "Abstracting control"
* "Tutorial notes on partial evaluation"
* "Representing Control: a Study of the CPS Transformation"
* "Type-directed partial evaluation"
* "A functional correspondence between evaluators and abstract machines"
* "Defunctionalization at Work"

Beyond his research, Olivier Danvy is also known for his passion for teaching and his belief in the importance of humor in technical education. He has taught courses on topics such as Introduction to Computer Science, Functional Programming and Proving, Mechanised Reasoning, Programming Language Design and Implementation, and Algorithms and Data Structures.
