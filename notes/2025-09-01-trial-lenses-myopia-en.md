title: Trial Lenses for Myopia Adjustment

You’ve got it right — **myopia vision test trial lenses** are the sets of loose lenses (and sometimes trial frames) that optometrists use to test different prescriptions during an eye exam.

### What They Are

* They are called **trial lenses** and are used with a **trial frame**.
* The lenses come in small metal or plastic rings, each labeled with its power (like −0.25D, −0.50D, +0.25D, etc.).
* By swapping lenses into the trial frame, you can experiment with different prescriptions and combinations (sphere, cylinder, axis) to see which feels most comfortable and gives clear vision.

### Why People Buy Them

* For personal myopia reversal experiments (like you mentioned: finding a “just barely clear” pair instead of full prescription).
* For training in optometry.
* Sometimes hobbyists or vision researchers buy them for home use to fine-tune their own glasses before ordering custom lenses online.

### Usual Names in Online Stores

If you search on **Amazon**, **Walmart**, or **optometry suppliers**, the common names are:

* **“Trial Lens Set”**
* **“Optometry Trial Lenses”**
* **“Vision Test Trial Lens Set”**
* **“Trial Frame and Lens Kit”**

On Amazon you’ll often see kits like “Optometry Trial Lens Set with 266 Lenses” or “Trial Frame with Trial Lenses”. On Walmart, fewer listings exist, but search for **“Trial Lens Set”** and you’ll find similar optometry training kits.

### What You Probably Need

Since you want to adjust with **−0.25D accuracy** to find the “just barely clear” prescription for phones/computer:

* A **basic trial lens set** (sometimes 50–100 lenses is enough, you don’t need the big 266-piece professional sets unless you also want cylinders for astigmatism).
* A **trial frame** that holds the lenses in front of your eyes.

That way, you can try −2.50, −2.75, −3.00, etc., directly and feel which one is most comfortable.

👉 Do you want me to suggest a **specific size of kit** (like a small 50-lens set with only spherical lenses) that is practical for home use, rather than the big, heavy professional ones?
