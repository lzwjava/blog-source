Yes, the Sleep Focus state (and other Focus modes) in macOS and iPhone is synced across devices via iCloud and tied to your Apple ID. As long as you're signed in with the same account on both devices and have "Share Across Devices" enabled in Settings > Focus (it's on by default), turning Sleep Focus on or off on one device will automatically activate the same state on the other—typically in real time, though very rare network hiccups could cause a brief delay.

To double-check the setting:
- On iPhone: Go to **Settings > Focus**, then toggle **Share Across Devices** at the bottom.
- On Mac: Go to **System Settings > Focus**, then toggle **Share Across Devices**.

This ensures your notification filters, allowed apps/people, and Focus status stay consistent everywhere.
