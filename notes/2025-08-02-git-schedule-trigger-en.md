This is a Git-style (e.g. GitHub Actions) scheduled trigger. Let’s break it down:

* **`on: schedule:`**
  Tells the workflow to run on a calendar schedule, not just on push or pull-request events.

* **`- cron: '0 * * * *'`**
  A standard five-field cron expression:

  ```
  ┌──────── minute (0)
  │ ┌────── hour (*, i.e. every hour)
  │ │ ┌──── day-of-month (*, i.e. every day)
  │ │ │ ┌── month (*, i.e. every month)
  │ │ │ │ ┌ day-of-week (*, i.e. every day of the week)
  │ │ │ │ │
  0 * * * *
  ```

  → **Runs at minute 0 of every hour** (i.e. at 00:00, 01:00, 02:00…23:00 UTC), every day.

* **But the comments above it say:**

  > Run every hour from 05:00–13:00 UTC, Mon–Fri
  > 05:00–13:00 UTC = 13:00–21:00 Beijing time (UTC+8)

  That intention (weekdays, only those hours) would actually require a more specific cron, for example:

  ```yaml
  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: '0 5-13 * * 1-5'
  ```

  which means:

  * at minute 0,
  * during hours 5 through 13 UTC,
  * on days Monday (1) through Friday (5).

  In Beijing time (UTC+8), that indeed corresponds to 13:00–21:00 local time, weekdays.

**In short:**

* As written (`'0 * * * *'`), it will fire **every hour on the hour**, 24×7.
* The comments describe a **weekday-only, 05:00–13:00 UTC** window—if that’s what you want, change the cron to include `5-13` for the hour field and `1-5` for the weekday field.
