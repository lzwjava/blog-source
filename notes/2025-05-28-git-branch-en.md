To visualize multiple branches in a Git repository on Windows, you can use TortoiseGit or other tools to display a graph of selected branches. TortoiseGit’s Revision Graph is powerful but can be overwhelming when showing all branches. Below are steps to view a graph of several specific branches using TortoiseGit, along with alternative tools for more flexibility.

### Using TortoiseGit to View Multiple Branches
TortoiseGit’s Revision Graph can display multiple branches, but it doesn’t allow selecting specific branches directly in the interface. However, you can filter the view to focus on relevant branches.

1. **Open Revision Graph**:
   - Navigate to your repository folder in Windows Explorer.
   - Right-click the folder, select **TortoiseGit** > **Revision Graph**.
   - This displays a graph of all references (branches, tags, etc.) by default, which can be cluttered if you have many branches.[](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-revgraph.html)

2. **Filter Specific Branches**:
   - In the Revision Graph window, use the **filter options** to reduce clutter:
     - Go to the **View** menu and select **Show branchings and mergings** to emphasize branch relationships.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67642974/tortoisegit-log-can-i-view-only-branch-and-merge-commits)
     - To focus on specific branches, right-click a commit and select **Show Log** to view the log dialog, where you can toggle **View > Labels > Local branches** or **Remote branches** to show only relevant references.[](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-showlog.html)
   - Alternatively, use the **Walk Behavior > Compressed Graph** option in the Log dialog to simplify the graph, showing only merge points and commits with references (like branch tips).[](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-showlog.html)[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67642974/tortoisegit-log-can-i-view-only-branch-and-merge-commits)

3. **Navigate the Graph**:
   - Use the **overview window** to navigate large graphs by dragging the highlighted area.[](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-revgraph.html)
   - Hover over a revision node to see details like date, author, and comments.[](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-revgraph.html)
   - Ctrl-click two revisions to compare them via the context menu (e.g., **Compare Revisions**).[](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-revgraph.html)

4. **Limitations**:
   - TortoiseGit’s Revision Graph shows all branches unless filtered, and there’s no direct option to select only specific branches in the graph view.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60244772/how-to-interpret-tortoise-git-revision-graph)
   - For a cleaner view, consider the alternative tools below.

### Alternative Tools for Viewing Multiple Branches
If TortoiseGit’s interface is too limited for selecting specific branches, try these tools, which offer more control over branch visualization:

#### 1. **Visual Studio Code with Git Graph Extension**
   - **Install**: Download Visual Studio Code and install the **Git Graph** extension.[](https://x.com/midudev/status/1797990974917927150)
   - **Usage**:
     - Open your repository in VS Code.
     - Access the Git Graph view from the Source Control tab or command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`, type “Git Graph”).
     - Select specific branches to display in the graph by clicking the branch names in the interface.
     - The graph shows commits, branches, and merges with color-coded lines for clarity.[](https://ardalis.com/git-graph-visualizes-branches-in-vs-code-for-free/)
   - **Benefits**: Lightweight, free, and allows selecting multiple branches interactively. Supports comparing commits and basic Git operations.[](https://ardalis.com/git-graph-visualizes-branches-in-vs-code-for-free/)

#### 2. **SourceTree**
   - **Install**: Download SourceTree (free) for Windows.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12324050/how-can-i-visualize-github-branch-history-on-windows)[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12912985/git-visual-diff-between-branches)
   - **Usage**:
     - Open your repository in SourceTree.
     - The **History** view shows a graphical representation of branches and commits.
     - Use the branch list on the left to toggle visibility of specific branches, focusing only on those you want to see.
     - Right-click branches or commits for actions like merging or comparing.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-visualizing-branch-topology-in-git/)
   - **Benefits**: Clear branch visualization with consistent coloring and interactive features like drag-and-drop merging.[](https://superuser.com/questions/699094/how-can-i-visualize-git-flow-branches)[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-visualizing-branch-topology-in-git/)

#### 3. **GitKraken**
   - **Install**: Download GitKraken (free for open-source projects, paid for private repos).[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-visualizing-branch-topology-in-git/)[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1838873/visualizing-branch-topology-in-git)
   - **Usage**:
     - Open your repository in GitKraken.
     - The central graph displays all branches, with options to hide/show specific branches via the branch list.
     - Click branch labels to focus on specific branches or use the search to filter commits.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-visualizing-branch-topology-in-git/)
   - **Benefits**: Intuitive and visually appealing, with consistent branch coloring and advanced features like conflict resolution.[](https://superuser.com/questions/699094/how-can-i-visualize-git-flow-branches)[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-visualizing-branch-topology-in-git/)

#### 4. **Command Line with `git log`**
   - If you prefer a terminal-based solution, use Git’s built-in graph view:
     ```bash
     git log --graph --oneline --decorate --branches=<branch1> --branches=<branch2>
     ```
     Replace `<branch1>` and `<branch2>` with the names of the branches you want to visualize (e.g., `feature1`, `feature2`). Use `--branches=*` for all branches or specify multiple branches explicitly.[](https://how-to.dev/how-to-display-git-branches-as-a-tree-in-cli)
   - **Alias for Convenience**:
     Create a Git alias for easier access:
     ```bash
     git config --global alias.tree "log --graph --oneline --decorate --branches="
     ```
     Then run `git tree feature1 feature2` to see a graph of only those branches.[](https://how-to.dev/how-to-display-git-branches-as-a-tree-in-cli)
   - **Benefits**: No additional software needed, and you can specify exact branches. Output is text-based but clear for small repositories.[](https://x.com/GWierzowiecki/status/1927657575048179899)

### Recommendations
- **For simplicity and integration**: Use **VS Code with Git Graph** for a lightweight, free solution that lets you select specific branches.[](https://x.com/midudev/status/1797990974917927150)
- **For advanced visualization**: Use **GitKraken** or **SourceTree** for a more polished GUI with interactive branch selection and consistent coloring.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-visualizing-branch-topology-in-git/)
- **For TortoiseGit users**: Stick with the Revision Graph and use filters like **Compressed Graph** or **Show branchings and mergings** to focus on key branches, but be aware of its limitations in selecting specific branches.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67642974/tortoisegit-log-can-i-view-only-branch-and-merge-commits)
- **For terminal users**: Use the `git log` command with specific branch filters for quick, precise visualization without extra tools.[](https://how-to.dev/how-to-display-git-branches-as-a-tree-in-cli)

If you have a large number of branches, GitKraken or SourceTree are likely the best options for selectively visualizing only the branches you care about, as they offer intuitive branch toggling. Let me know if you need help setting up any of these tools or further clarification!
