Here's a more detailed look at the economic aspects of Manila:

**Key Economic Features of Manila:**

* **Major Hub:** Manila has been the principal city of the Philippines for four centuries and remains the center of the country's economic, political, social, and cultural activity.
* **Service-Oriented Economy:** The economy of the Philippines, and particularly Metro Manila, is largely service-oriented. In 2023, the services sector contributed 62.3% to the national GDP. This sector includes trade, finance, transportation, communication, and tourism.
* **Trade and Commerce:** Manila is a significant center for trade and finance in the Philippines. Most of the country's imports and exports pass through the Port of Manila. The districts north of the Pasig River are key areas for trade and commerce.

    * Textile production
    * Publishing and printing
    * Food and tobacco processing
    * Chemical processing
    * Production of lumber and wood items, rope, soap, and other goods.
    * Electronics
* **Finance:** Many major financial institutions are headquartered in Manila, including the Development Bank of the Philippines, the Philippine National Bank, and numerous private commercial and development banks. The Philippine Stock Exchange is also located here.
* **Global City Status:** Manila is considered part of the world's original set of global cities due to its historical commercial networks. In 2018, it was listed as an "Alpha-" global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, ranking seventh in economic performance globally and second regionally.

* **Tourism:** Tourism is an important contributor to Manila's economy, with the Philippines achieving record-high tourism revenue in 2024.

**Important Considerations:**

* The revenue figure provided is specifically for the **City of Manila**. Metro Manila encompasses a much larger area with multiple cities and municipalities, and its total economic output and revenue would be significantly higher.
* Economic data can have a time lag, so the 2022 figure is the most recent specific revenue for the City of Manila found in the search results.
* The Philippine economy is classified as a developing/emerging, lower-middle-income, and newly industrialized country.

In summary, Manila serves as the economic heart of the Philippines, with a strong emphasis on services, trade, finance, and a notable manufacturing sector. The city generates substantial revenue and plays a crucial role in the national economy.

* Other sources provide slightly different figures. A 2022 survey by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) placed the average monthly wage at **₱18,423** (around **$335 USD**).

The median represents the middle value, meaning half of the employees earn less and half earn more than this amount.
* **Average Annual Family Income:** In 2023, the average annual family income was estimated at **₱353,230** (approximately **$6,422 USD**). This figure can vary significantly by region, with the National Capital Region (NCR) having the highest average family income.

**2. Income of IT Workers:**

* IT workers generally earn above the national average due to the demand for their skills.

* **Industry and Company Size:** Multinational companies and those in higher-growth sectors may offer more competitive salaries.
* **Skills and Specialization:** Specific in-demand skills within the IT sector (e.g., cloud computing, AI, cybersecurity) can lead to higher earning potential.
