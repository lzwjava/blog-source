Transformer Circuits is a research publication platform focused on mechanistic interpretability in transformer-based language models. It hosts a collaborative series of technical papers, blog posts, and analyses from Anthropic's interpretability team, aiming to reverse-engineer how these AI models work at a granular level—breaking down neural networks into interpretable "circuits" to understand emergent behaviors like induction heads or factual recall.

### Key Highlights:
- **Main Theme**: Demystifying transformers by studying toy models, scaling laws, and real-world examples (e.g., GPT-2). It's part of the broader push for AI safety through transparency.
- **Notable Content**:
  - "A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits" (introductory paper).
  - Deep dives into specific mechanisms, like attention patterns or modular architectures.
  - Updates on ongoing research, with code, datasets, and visualizations shared via GitHub.
- **Creators**: Primarily led by Anthropic researchers like Chris Olah, Neel Nanda, and others in the interpretability field.

If you're into AI alignment or ML internals, it's a goldmine for hands-on insights.
