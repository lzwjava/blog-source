You cannot directly invoke GitHub Copilot as a plugin from the command line using a syntax like `code --plugin copilot "hi"` to get a response. However, GitHub Copilot does offer command-line integration through the GitHub CLI with the `gh copilot` extension, which provides a chat-like interface for command suggestions and explanations. This is not exactly the same as a generic plugin invoked via the `code` command, but it serves a similar purpose for command-line interactions.

### Details on GitHub Copilot in the CLI
- **Requirements**: You need a GitHub Copilot subscription, GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed, and the `gh-copilot` extension installed. Instructions for setup are available in the GitHub CLI repository or documentation [GitHub CLI Installation](https://cli.github.com/) and [Installing GitHub Copilot in the CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-in-the-command-line).
- **Usage**: Once set up, you can use commands like:
  - `gh copilot suggest -t shell "hi"` to get a shell command suggestion.
  - `gh copilot explain "hi"` to get an explanation of a command.
  - Example: Running `gh copilot suggest -t shell "say hello"` might suggest `echo "hello"` or a text-to-speech command like `say "hello"` on macOS, depending on the context.
- **Limitations**: The CLI interface is designed for command-line-related tasks (e.g., shell, Git, or GitHub CLI commands) and does not support generic conversational responses like a chatbot. It also only supports English prompts [Responsible use of GitHub Copilot in the CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-in-the-cli).[](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use/copilot-in-the-cli)[](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-in-the-cli)
- **Interactive Mode**: After running a `suggest` command, Copilot starts an interactive session where you can refine the suggestion, execute it (copies to clipboard), or rate it. For automatic execution, you need to set up the `ghcs` alias [Using GitHub Copilot in the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-in-the-command-line).[](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-for-common-tasks/use-copilot-in-the-cli)[](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-in-the-command-line)

### Why `code --plugin copilot "hi"` Doesn’t Work
- **Visual Studio Code CLI**: The `code` command (for VS Code) supports options like `--install-extension` to install extensions, but it does not have a `--plugin` flag to invoke extensions directly with input like `"hi"`. Extensions like GitHub Copilot typically operate within the VS Code editor, providing inline suggestions or chat interfaces, not as standalone CLI tools [GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview).[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview)
- **Copilot’s Architecture**: GitHub Copilot’s plugin for VS Code communicates with a language server and GitHub’s backend for code completions and chat. There’s no public API or CLI mechanism to pass arbitrary strings like `"hi"` directly to the plugin from the command line and get a response [How to invoke Github Copilot programmatically?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76761429/how-to-invoke-github-copilot-programmatically).[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76741410/how-to-invoke-github-copilot-programmatically)
- **Alternative for Generic Input**: If you want to send a prompt like `"hi"` to Copilot and get a response, you’d need to use Copilot Chat within VS Code or another supported IDE, or explore other AI CLI tools that support conversational prompts (e.g., Microsoft’s AI Shell for Azure CLI) [Use Microsoft Copilot in Azure with AI Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/copilot/use-copilot-cli).[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/copilot/ai-shell-overview)

### Workaround for Your Goal
If your goal is to invoke an AI assistant like Copilot from the command line with a prompt like `"hi"` and get a response, you can:
1. **Use `gh copilot` for Command-Line Tasks**:
   - Install GitHub CLI and the Copilot extension.
   - Run `gh copilot suggest -t shell "greet with hi"` to get a command like `echo "hi"`.
   - This is limited to command-line contexts, so `"hi"` alone may not yield a meaningful response unless framed as a command request.
2. **Use VS Code’s Copilot Chat**:
   - Open VS Code, use the Copilot Chat interface (accessible via `⌃⌘I` or the chat icon), and type `"hi"` to get a conversational response.
   - This requires manual interaction within the editor, not a CLI invocation [GitHub Copilot in VS Code cheat sheet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-cheat-sheet).[](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/copilot-vscode-features)
3. **Explore Other AI CLI Tools**:
   - **AI Shell**: Microsoft’s AI Shell allows natural-language prompts in the CLI for Azure-related tasks. You can install it and try prompts like `"hi"`, though it’s optimized for Azure CLI and PowerShell commands [Use Microsoft Copilot in Azure with AI Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/copilot/use-copilot-cli).[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/copilot/ai-shell-overview)
   - **Custom Scripts**: You could write a script to interact with an AI model’s API (e.g., OpenAI’s API, if accessible) to process prompts like `"hi"`. However, GitHub Copilot’s API is not publicly available for such use [How to invoke Github Copilot programmatically?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76761429/how-to-invoke-github-copilot-programmatically).[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76741410/how-to-invoke-github-copilot-programmatically)
4. **Simulate Plugin Behavior**:
   - Create a shell script or alias that pipes input to `gh copilot suggest` or another AI CLI tool.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     alias ai='gh copilot suggest -t shell'
     ai "greet with hi"
     ```
     This would suggest a command like `echo "hi"` or similar.

### Programmatic Invocation
If you’re looking to programmatically invoke Copilot-like functionality (as implied by your example), note that:
- GitHub Copilot does not expose a public API for direct programmatic access. Some community efforts have reverse-engineered the language server or used proxies to capture suggestions, but these are complex and risky (e.g., potential for account bans) [How to invoke Github Copilot programmatically?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76761429/how-to-invoke-github-copilot-programmatically).[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76741410/how-to-invoke-github-copilot-programmatically)
- You could explore open-source alternatives or other AI models with CLI integrations (e.g., Hugging Face’s CLI tools or local LLMs like LLaMA with custom wrappers).

### Conclusion
While `code --plugin copilot "hi"` is not supported, you can achieve similar functionality using `gh copilot` for command-line tasks or Copilot Chat in VS Code for conversational prompts. For a generic CLI AI experience, consider tools like AI Shell or custom scripts with other AI APIs. Always verify suggestions, as Copilot’s CLI responses may contain errors or biases from training data [Responsible use of GitHub Copilot in the CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-in-the-cli).[](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-in-the-cli)
