### Typical Street Drinks in Guangzhou

Guangzhou's street food scene is vibrant, especially for refreshing drinks like lemon tea, watermelon juice, and milk tea. These are staples at roadside stalls, night markets (like Beijing Road or Shamian Island areas), and small chain shops. They're perfect for the humid weather—light, fruity, and often customizable with ice levels or sweetness. Prices are affordable, usually ¥10-25 per drink.

#### Lemon Tea Spots
These are super popular, often with hand-squeezed lemons for a fresh, tangy kick. Typical menu includes:
- Classic iced lemon tea (black tea base with fresh lemon).
- Oolong or jasmine green tea lemon blends.
- Fruit twists like passion fruit or Thai green lemon tea.
- Add-ons: pulp, mint, or less sugar for a healthier vibe.

**Recommendation**: Head to **Ning Ji Lemon Tea** (multiple locations, like near CG Mall). Their signature Phoenix Oolong Lemon Tea is a must—zesty, balanced, and comes with a fun crocodile mascot vibe. It's iconic for Guangzhou locals and tourists alike.

#### Watermelon Drinks
Fresh fruit juices are everywhere from mobile carts or market stalls, especially in summer. Watermelon is a go-to for its hydrating, sweet crunch. Typical menu:
- Pure fresh watermelon juice (blended and strained, served iced).
- Variations with lime, mint, or a splash of carbonated water for fizz.
- Sometimes mixed with other fruits like papaya or added to smoothies.

**Recommendation**: Grab one from street vendors at **Beijing Road Pedestrian Street**—look for carts with whole watermelons on display. It's simple, pure refreshment, and often just ¥5-10. Avoid tourist traps; the fresher the better.

#### Milk Tea Spots
Bubble tea chains dominate, with chewy tapioca pearls (boba) and creamy textures. Typical menu:
- Classic pearl milk tea (black tea with milk and boba).
- Brown sugar boba milk tea (syrupy and caramel-like).
- Fruit or cheese foam versions, like jasmine green milk tea or mango.
- Low-sugar options or decaf teas for variety.

**Recommendation**: Try **Heytea (喜茶)** for innovative twists—their coconut or strawberry milk tea with cheese foam is creamy without being too sweet. For a classic, **Chagee (霸王茶姬)**'s jasmine green milk tea is smooth and aromatic. Both have street-level outlets everywhere.

If you're wandering Guangzhou streets, start at Beijing Road for a mix of all three—it's like a drink crawl! Pro tip: Order "less ice" (少冰) if you want more flavor punch.
