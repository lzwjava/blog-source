- **Managing Locks**  
  - "How do I check active locks in an IBM Db2 database?"  
  - "What steps can I take to prevent lock contention in Db2?"  

- **Troubleshooting**  
  - "How do I identify and resolve a deadlock in IBM Db2?"  
  - "Why is my Db2 query waiting on a lock, and how do I fix it?"  

- **Verbose Output**  
  - "How can I enable detailed lock information in Db2 logs?"  
  - "Show me how to configure Db2 to output lock wait details."
