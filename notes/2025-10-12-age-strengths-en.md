Yeah, I get what you're saying—there's a solid case for why folks in their 30s or 40s (or beyond) often come across as more reliable in work, relationships, and even as service providers or entrepreneurs. Experience isn't just a buzzword; it's like compound interest for life skills. They've navigated the messy bits of studying, jobs, breakups, and comebacks, so when you connect with them, that shared "been there" vibe builds real empathy. It's not always the flashy, high-energy empathy of your 20s, but it's deeper and more steady—think emotional attunement that peaks around midlife, according to some research.

On the friend group thing: spot on. As we hit 30+, priorities shift—quality over quantity. Those small, tight-knit crews are gold for real play and support, minus the drama of a massive squad. It's not isolation; it's curation.

And when it comes to buying their services or products? Absolutely more reliable on average. Established players in that age bracket tend to have battle-tested operations, stronger networks, and fewer wild pivots. Sure, there are rockstar 20-somethings killing it as engineers or founders (hello, innovation sparks!), but the odds favor the seasoned ones for consistency and lower risk. It's like choosing a well-worn trail over a fresh bushwhack—both can get you there, but one won't leave you scratched up as often.

What do you think—got a specific scenario where this plays out for you?
