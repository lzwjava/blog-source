Your observation touches on a critical tension in the tech and finance industries: the balance between **hiring engineering talent** and **delivering successful products**. Here’s a breakdown of why this happens and how to understand it:

### 1. **The "Throw Engineers at the Problem" Fallacy**
   - Many big tech firms and banks believe that hiring top engineers will automatically translate into innovation and profitability. However, engineering talent alone **does not guarantee product success**.
   - **Example**: Google and Meta have hired thousands of engineers, yet many of their initiatives (e.g., Google+, Meta’s metaverse) failed because they lacked **product-market fit** or clear strategic direction.

### 2. **Legacy Companies Struggle to Innovate**
   - Companies like Google, IBM, or big banks sit on **cash cows** (e.g., search ads, enterprise software, trading desks) but struggle to innovate because:
     - **Bureaucracy** slows decision-making.
     - **Risk aversion** prevents bold moves (e.g., OpenAI eating Google’s lunch in AI).
     - **Legacy systems** make it hard to pivot (banks still run on COBOL!).
   - They **don’t need more engineers**—they need **better product vision**.

### 3. **Anthropic, OpenAI, and the Startup Challenge**
   - Startups like OpenAI and Anthropic succeeded because they **focused on product-first innovation**, not just hiring engineers.
   - They took risks (e.g., OpenAI betting on ChatGPT despite skepticism).
   - Big tech **could have built these products** (Google had Transformer models first!) but failed to **execute as a product company**.

### 4. **Why Big Tech Still Hires Engineers Anyway**
   - **Defensive hiring**: To prevent talent from going to competitors.
   - **Stock price optics**: Investors like seeing "top talent" acquisitions.
   - **Hope that someday, something works**: E.g., Google’s "20% time" rarely leads to breakthroughs now.

### 5. **The Real Solution: Product Leadership > Engineering Muscle**
   - **Apple** is the best example: They don’t hire the most engineers, but they **ship products people love** (iPhone, AirPods).
   - **Elon’s companies (Tesla, SpaceX)**: Engineering is critical, but **product vision drives everything**.
   - **Big banks failing in fintech**: They hire engineers but don’t let them disrupt the core business.

### **Key Takeaway**
Big tech and banks fail when they think **engineering = innovation**. The real winners (OpenAI, Apple, Tesla) succeed because they:
- **Start with product vision**, not just hiring.
- **Empower small, agile teams** (not bureaucratic monsters).
- **Take risks** instead of protecting legacy cash cows.

The future belongs to companies that **think like product-first startups**, even if they’re giants. Hiring engineers without a clear product strategy just leads to **expensive failures**.
