### Traditional Cantonese Soups from Guangzhou

Guangzhou (in Guangdong province) is the heart of Cantonese cuisine, where soups—called "tong"—are a daily staple. They're often slow-simmered for hours to extract natural flavors and health benefits, like cooling the body in humid weather or boosting immunity. Cantonese soups fall into three main types: *gwan tong* (quick-boiled, under 3 hours), *lou fo tong* (slow-boiled, 3+ hours for deep umami), and *dan tong* (double-boiled in a sealed pot for crystal-clear broth). Ingredients are seasonal and medicinal, using pork, chicken, veggies, herbs, and fruits.

Here are four easy-to-make traditional options perfect for home cooking. I'll give a full recipe for one popular beginner-friendly soup, plus summaries for the others. These serve 4-6 and use common Guangzhou market ingredients like fresh pork, yam, or watercress.

#### 1. **Cantonese Pork Soup with Carrots & Chinese Yam** (Lou Fo Tong Style)
This nourishing soup is mildly sweet, warming, and great for digestion. It's a Guangzhou classic, often made with lean pork for a clear broth.

**Prep Time:** 2 hours (mostly soaking)  
**Cook Time:** 3.5 hours  
**Servings:** 6  

**Ingredients:**  
- 1 lb (450g) lean pork (e.g., pork butt with skin on), cut into large chunks  
- 4 slices fresh ginger  
- 4 dried red dates, pitted  
- 1 tbsp dried goji berries  
- 3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into chunks  
- 4 dried shiitake mushrooms  
- 1 lb (450g) Chinese yam (huai shan), peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks  
- 14 cups water (plus mushroom soaking water)  
- Salt, to taste (add at table)  
- Light soy sauce, for dipping pork  

**Steps:**  
1. Rinse shiitake mushrooms and soak in warm water for 2-3 hours. Reserve the soaking water.  
2. Blanch pork: Place in a pot with enough water to cover, bring to a boil, then drain and rinse pork under cold water to remove scum. Clean the pot.  
3. Add pork back to pot with soaked mushrooms, carrots, red dates, goji berries, ginger, and 14 cups water (plus mushroom water). Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a gentle simmer (small bubbles only). Cover and simmer for 2 hours.  
4. Add Chinese yam chunks. Bring to a medium boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer 1 more hour until yam is fork-tender.  
5. Skim any foam. Serve hot, with salt on the side. Shred pork for dipping in soy sauce or add chunks to bowls.  

**Tips:** Make it a day ahead—the flavors deepen overnight. Use a clay pot for authentic taste if you have one.  

#### 2. **Watercress and Pork Soup** (Gwan Tong Style)
A quick, detoxifying soup popular in Guangzhou for clearing heat. It's peppery and refreshing.  

**Key Ingredients:** 1 lb pork ribs or lean pork, 1 large bunch watercress (washed thoroughly), 2-3 slices ginger, 1 dried honey date, 8 cups water. Optional: salted egg or preserved tofu for dipping.  

**Quick Steps:** Blanch pork, add all ingredients to a pot, boil vigorously for 10 mins, then simmer 45-60 mins until watercress is soft. Salt to taste. Ready in under 1.5 hours.  

#### 3. **Asian Pear, Snow Fungus, and Chicken Soup** (Lou Fo Tong Style)
A moisturizing autumn/winter soup for dry skin and lungs, using seasonal pears.  

**Key Ingredients:** 1 whole old chicken (1.5+ kg, for richness), 2 Asian pears (peeled, quartered), 1 oz snow fungus (soaked), 1/2 cup pumpkin chunks, 1/4 cup apricot kernels, 12 cups water, ginger slices.  

**Quick Steps:** Blanch and rinse chicken. Simmer all ingredients gently for 3+ hours until broth is sweet and clear. Strain if desired; no added salt needed.  

#### 4. **Almond and Pork Lung Soup** (Dan Tong Style)
Creamy and collagen-rich for respiratory health—a Guangzhou herbal favorite.  

**Key Ingredients:** 1 lb pork lungs (cleaned well), 1/4 cup almonds (soaked), 1 oz fish maw (soaked and shredded), 10 cups water, ginger, dried dates.  

**Quick Steps:** Double-boil in a ceramic pot submerged in simmering water for 4+ hours (or slow-simmer if no double-boiler). Results in a milky, nutty broth.  

Start with the pork and yam soup—it's forgiving and uses everyday ingredients. Shop at wet markets in Guangzhou like Qingping for fresh produce. Experiment with herbs like ginseng for extra boost. Enjoy your souping!
