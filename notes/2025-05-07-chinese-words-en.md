Blocking Chinese posts on X based on specific words requires careful consideration, as many common Chinese words are used in various contexts and could lead to over-filtering. Below is a list of 20 commonly used Chinese words, including 的, which are frequently found in Chinese text due to their grammatical, connective, or everyday usage. These words are general and not specific to any topic, making them prevalent in posts on X or other platforms:

1. 的 (de) - possessive particle, like "of" or "-'s"
2. 是 (shì) - to be, is
3. 在 (zài) - at, in, on
4. 不 (bù) - not, no
5. 了 (le) - completed action marker
6. 和 (hé) - and, with
7. 我 (wǒ) - I, me
8. 你 (nǐ) - you
9. 他 (tā) - he, him
10. 这 (zhè) - this
11. 那 (nà) - that
12. 有 (yǒu) - have, exist
13. 就 (jiù) - then, just
14. 来 (lái) - come
15. 去 (qù) - go
16. 会 (huì) - can, will
17. 人 (rén) - person, people
18. 说 (shuō) - say, speak
19. 一个 (yī gè) - one (classifier for objects)
20. 很 (hěn) - very

### Notes on Blocking:
- **Over-filtering Risk**: Words like 的, 是, or 和 are so common that filtering them might block nearly all Chinese content, including non-Chinese posts with shared characters (e.g., Japanese or Korean). For example, 的 appears in almost every Chinese sentence.
- **Context Matters**: These words are neutral and used in all types of posts (casual, formal, political, etc.). To target specific content (e.g., spam or propaganda), consider filtering topic-specific terms or phrases instead.
- **Implementation**: On X, you can mute words via settings (Settings > Privacy and security > Muted > Muted words). Add these words or their simplified Chinese characters. Be aware that X’s mute feature may not catch all variations or posts with mixed languages.
- **Alternatives**: If the goal is to reduce exposure to Chinese-language posts, you could also follow accounts posting in preferred languages or use X’s algorithmic feed to prioritize relevant content.

If you want a more targeted list (e.g., for specific topics like politics or spam) or help with setting up filters, let me know!
