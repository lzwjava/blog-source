Your reflection touches on several deep themes: **mobility, economic constraints, societal shifts post-COVID, and the contrast between China and the U.S. in terms of travel and lifestyle choices**. Let’s break this down systematically:

---

### **1. Your Personal Context: Leaving Beijing in Early 2020**
Your decision to leave Beijing just before COVID-19 exploded—and not return—reflects a **deliberate rejection of the "hustle culture" hub** (Beijing/Shanghai/Shenzhen) in favor of a more flexible, decentralized lifestyle. This aligns with global trends:
- **Remote Work Revolution**: COVID accelerated the acceptance of remote work, making it feasible to live in lower-cost cities (e.g., Guangzhou, Chengdu, or even smaller towns) while maintaining professional output.
- **Cost of Living vs. Quality of Life**: Beijing’s high costs (housing, education, healthcare) may not justify the benefits for someone with your skills (remote-friendly tech expertise). Your move suggests prioritizing **autonomy over prestige**.
- **"Digital Nomad" Mindset**: Your background (freelancing, startups, cloud engineering) fits the profile of someone who can **earn globally while living locally**. This is rare in China due to strict internet controls and payment systems, but you’ve adapted (e.g., working for international clients via outsourcing firms).

**Why You Didn’t Return**:
- **COVID Lockdowns**: Beijing’s strict policies (e.g., 2022’s 2-month lockdown) would have disrupted your mobility-focused lifestyle.
- **Economic Rationality**: If your income isn’t tied to Beijing (e.g., no need for *hukou* benefits), staying in Guangzhou or elsewhere offers better **cost-to-freedom ratio**.
- **Philosophical Shift**: Your research on "life hacking" and vision restoration hints at a **biohacker/minimalist ethos**—valuing health, flexibility, and self-sufficiency over urban status symbols.

### **2. Travel in China Post-COVID: Why It’s Limited**
China’s domestic travel patterns post-COVID are shaped by:
#### **A. Economic Pressures**
- **Youth Unemployment**: ~20% for ages 16–24 (2023). Discretionary spending (e.g., interprovincial travel) is declining.
- **Real Estate Crisis**: Wealth is trapped in unsellable property, reducing disposable income for leisure.
- **Localism**: With economic uncertainty, people **double down on local networks** (e.g., *guanxi* in their home province) rather than risking mobility.

#### **B. Structural Barriers**
- **Hukou System**: Limits access to healthcare/education outside one’s registered city, discouraging long-term relocation.
- **Internet Fragmentation**: Apps/services are regional (e.g., Didi in Tier-1 cities, local payment systems). Moving disrupts digital life.
- **Transport Costs**: High-speed rail is expensive for frequent travel; budget airlines are underdeveloped.

#### **C. Cultural Shifts**
- **"Lying Flat" (躺平)**: Post-COVID, many reject the grind of big-city life but lack resources to travel widely.
- **Domestic Tourism Boom**: Travel is **short-radius** (e.g., Guangdong residents visiting Hainan) due to budget constraints and fear of sudden lockdowns.
- **Nationalism**: Outbound travel is politically sensitive (e.g., "don’t go to the U.S." narratives), and passport issuance is restricted for some groups.

**Contrast with Pre-COVID**:
Before 2020, China’s middle class was **globally mobile** (e.g., 150M outbound trips in 2019). Now, international travel is **~30% of 2019 levels** (2023 data), concentrated among the wealthy or those with overseas family ties.

### **3. Travel in the U.S. Post-COVID: A Different Story**
The U.S. presents a stark contrast due to:
#### **A. Economic and Labor Flexibility**
- **Remote Work Dominance**: ~12% of U.S. workers are fully remote (vs. ~2% in China). Tech/consulting roles (like yours) can be done from anywhere.
- **"Workations"**: Companies like Airbnb and Shopify encourage employees to work from other states/countries for months.
- **Gig Economy**: Freelancers (e.g., software consultants) can **earn in USD while living in low-cost areas** (e.g., Portugal, Thailand, or U.S. rural towns).

#### **B. Cultural Norms**
- **"Digital Nomad" Visa Programs**: Countries like Spain, Portugal, and Mexico offer visas for remote workers. Americans leverage these to **live abroad cheaply** while keeping U.S. salaries.
- **Van Life/RV Culture**: Post-COVID, many Americans bought RVs to **travel domestically** while working remotely (e.g., #VanLife on Instagram).
- **Global Mobility**: U.S. passports allow visa-free access to 180+ countries. Chinese passports? **~80** (and many require proof of assets/employment).

#### **C. Economic Incentives**
- **Weak USD Abroad**: In 2022–2023, the strong USD made countries like Turkey, Colombia, or Vietnam **extremely affordable** for Americans.
- **Tax Arbitrage**: Some U.S. remote workers **renounce residency** to avoid state taxes (e.g., moving to Florida or Puerto Rico).
- **Airbnb Economy**: Short-term rentals make it easy to "test" living in new cities before committing.

**Post-COVID Travel Trends in the U.S.**:
- **Domestic**: Road trips, national parks, and "bleisure" (business + leisure) travel surged.
- **International**: Europe (especially Portugal/Spain) and Latin America (Mexico, Costa Rica) are top destinations for remote workers.
- **"Slow Travel"**: Instead of 1-week vacations, people stay **1–3 months** in a place (enabled by remote work).

### **4. Why the China-U.S. Divide?**
| Factor               | China                          | U.S.                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Mobility Culture** | Hukou ties, local networks     | "Go where the work is" ethos  |
| **Remote Work**      | Rare (~2% fully remote)        | Common (~12%)                 |
| **Passport Power**   | Weak (rank ~70 globally)       | Strong (rank #7)              |
| **Cost Arbitrage**   | Hard (currency controls)       | Easy (USD accepted worldwide) |
| **Post-COVID Mindset** | Risk-averse, local focus      | "Revenge travel," flexibility  |
| **Infrastructure**   | High-speed rail (local travel) | Cheap flights, RV culture     |

### **5. Your Path Forward: Leveraging Your Unique Position**
Given your skills (cloud engineering, freelance experience, English proficiency), you’re **uniquely positioned to exploit global mobility trends**:
#### **A. Hybrid China-Global Strategy**
- **Keep Guangzhou as a Base**: Low cost of living + access to China’s tech ecosystem.
- **Client Diversity**: Work for **international clients** (via Upwork/Toptal) or **remote-first companies** (e.g., GitLab, Zapier).
- **Passport Hacking**: If possible, obtain a **second residency** (e.g., Portugal D7, Mexico temporary residency) to unlock global travel.

#### **B. Digital Nomad Opportunities**
- **Southeast Asia**: Thailand (Chiang Mai), Vietnam (Da Nang), or Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur) are **low-cost, high-quality** hubs for remote workers.
- **Latin America**: Mexico City, Medellín, or Buenos Aires offer **strong tech communities** and time-zone alignment with U.S. clients.
- **Europe**: Portugal’s D7 visa or Spain’s digital nomad visa let you **live in the EU** while working remotely.

#### **C. Niche Advantages**
- **China-U.S. Bridge**: Your experience with **HSBC/DBS (global banks)** + **Chinese fintech** is valuable for companies needing **cross-border expertise**.
- **Open-Source Portfolio**: Your GitHub projects could attract **remote-first startups** or **open-source grants** (e.g., GitHub Sponsors).
- **Writing/Blogging**: Monetize your **15K monthly views** via sponsorships, courses, or Patreon.

#### **D. Long-Term Vision**
- **Geographic Arbitrage**: Earn in **USD/EUR** while living in **low-cost regions** (e.g., $3K/month in Guangzhou = $10K/month lifestyle in Vietnam).
- **Family Flexibility**: Your daughter’s early exposure to English animations suggests you’re **raising a global citizen**—leverage this for future mobility (e.g., international schools, bilingualism).
- **Health Optimization**: Your myopia research aligns with **biohacking communities** (e.g., in Bali or Lisbon) where like-minded people experiment with lifestyle design.

### **6. Risks and Challenges**
- **China’s Outbound Restrictions**: Capital controls ($50K/year limit) and **exit bans** (if you have unresolved debts/legal issues).
- **U.S. Visa Hurdles**: Getting a **U.S. work visa** (H-1B, L-1) is hard, but **freelancing for U.S. clients** is easier (use Wise/TransferWise for payments).
- **Tax Complexity**: China taxes worldwide income for residents. Structuring earnings via **Hong Kong/Singapore entities** may help (consult a CPA).
- **Cultural Adjustment**: If you move abroad, **reverse culture shock** (e.g., guilt over leaving family) is real.

### **7. Key Takeaways**
1. **Your 2020 Exit Was Prescient**: You avoided Beijing’s lockdowns and embraced a **location-independent lifestyle** before it became mainstream in China.
2. **China’s Travel Decline Is Structural**: Economic pressure + hukou + political controls make mobility hard for most, but **your skills let you opt out**.
3. **The U.S. (and West) Offers More Freedom**: Remote work, strong passports, and cultural acceptance of nomadism create opportunities **you can tap into**.
4. **Your Next Step Could Be**:
   - **Test the Waters**: Spend 1–3 months in a digital nomad hub (e.g., Chiang Mai) while keeping Guangzhou as a backup.
   - **Build Passive Income**: Monetize your blog, open-source work, or consulting to **reduce reliance on location**.
   - **Explore Residency Options**: Portugal, Mexico, or UAE offer **easy visas for remote workers**.

### **Final Thought**
You’re living at the intersection of **China’s constraints** and **global mobility’s expansion**. Most Chinese can’t (or won’t) leave their cities; most Westerners take mobility for granted. Your background—**tech skills, freelance experience, and minimalist mindset**—puts you in a **rare position to design a life across borders**.

The question isn’t *"Should I travel?"* but **"How can I structure my life to travel *and* thrive?"**—and you’ve already taken the first steps.

Would you like specific recommendations on **visas, remote job platforms, or tax optimization** based on your goals?
