Here’s an **outline** for the course **Ideological and Moral Cultivation and Rule of Law** (also called “Ideological & Moral Cultivation & Legal Basis”), tailored for your National Self-Study Exam (15042) preparation. I’ll keep it in a textual outline (not a table) to fit your preference.

2. World-outlook, life-outlook, values: how to form them, how to live by them; the role of culture, tradition, modern society.

## 4. Study Tips for the National Self-Study Exam

* Since you have a strong technical background, treat this course like a foundation in “soft skills” for the modern era. Try to relate the moral/legal issues to real life (e.g., technology ethics, data law, your future engineering role).
* Make sure you understand key concepts and their relationships: ideology ↔ morality ↔ law.
* Practise applying knowledge: what would a morally and legally literate engineer do in a given scenario?
* Memorise the major frameworks (e.g., socialist core values) but also aim for deeper understanding: why they matter, how they integrate with law and ideology.
* Pay attention to current policy language: words like “新时代”、 “社会主义核心价值观”、 “法治”、 “德育” are often referenced.
* Use past exam papers (if available) to see how questions are asked: definitions, comparisons, case‐analyses, short essays.
* Given your self‐study context, create summary notes per thematic block and revisit them regularly.
