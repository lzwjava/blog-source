Wi-Fi technology has seen remarkable global adoption over the past few decades, transforming how we connect to the internet. Here's an overview of this evolution:

## 1990s-2000s: Early Adoption
- Wi-Fi standards emerged with IEEE 802.11b (1999)
- Initial adoption primarily in business environments and wealthy nations
- Limited to 11 Mbps speeds
- By 2007, approximately 300 million Wi-Fi devices were in use globally

## 2010s: Mainstream Growth
- Wi-Fi became standard in homes across developed countries
- Developing nations saw rapid growth in urban areas
- Public Wi-Fi hotspots expanded dramatically (airports, cafes, hotels)
- Mobile devices drove adoption with smartphones becoming Wi-Fi dependent
- Standards evolved to 802.11n and then 802.11ac with gigabit speeds
- By 2018, over 9.5 billion Wi-Fi devices were in use worldwide

## 2020s: Near-Universal Adoption
- Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) and Wi-Fi 6E deployment began
- COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption for remote work/education
- Global home Wi-Fi penetration reached approximately 70% by 2023
- Rural adoption gaps narrowed but remained significant
- Public Wi-Fi evolved toward free access models in many regions
- Wi-Fi became critical infrastructure alongside cellular networks
- Smart homes and IoT devices dramatically increased Wi-Fi dependency

## Regional Differences
- North America, Europe, East Asia: Near-universal adoption (85-95%)
- Latin America, Middle East: Strong urban adoption (60-80%)
- Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia: Growing rapidly but substantial gaps remain (30-60%)
- Urban-rural divide persists globally, though narrowing

The most dramatic growth occurred between 2010-2020, when Wi-Fi transformed from a luxury to an essential utility in much of the world.
