Below are code examples demonstrating how images are processed using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Vision Transformers (ViT)** in Python with **PyTorch**.

---

## **1. Image Processing with a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
CNNs are widely used for image classification, object detection, and feature extraction.

### **Example: Using a Pre-trained CNN (ResNet)**
```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from PIL import Image

# Load a pre-trained ResNet model
model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
model.eval()  # Set to evaluation mode

# Define image preprocessing
preprocess = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])

# Load and preprocess an image
image = Image.open("example.jpg")  # Replace with your image path
input_tensor = preprocess(image)
input_batch = input_tensor.unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dimension

# Move to GPU if available
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    input_batch = input_batch.to('cuda')
    model.to('cuda')

# Extract features (before the final classification layer)
with torch.no_grad():
    features = model(input_batch)

print("Feature vector shape:", features.shape)  # e.g., torch.Size([1, 1000])
```
**Explanation**:
1. **ResNet18** is a CNN architecture pre-trained on ImageNet.
2. The image is preprocessed (resized, normalized).
3. The model converts the image into a **feature vector** (e.g., 1000-dimensional for ResNet18).

---

## **2. Image Processing with a Vision Transformer (ViT)**
ViTs treat images as sequences of patches and use self-attention mechanisms (like in NLP).

### **Example: Using a Pre-trained ViT (Hugging Face)**
```python
from transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor, ViTModel
from PIL import Image
import torch

# Load a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT)
model_name = "google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k"
feature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = ViTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Load an image
image = Image.open("example.jpg")  # Replace with your image path

# Preprocess the image (convert to patches)
inputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

# Extract features (CLS token or patch embeddings)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Get the feature vector (CLS token)
features = outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]  # Shape: [1, 768]

print("Feature vector shape:", features.shape)  # e.g., torch.Size([1, 768])
```
**Explanation**:
1. **ViT** splits the image into **16x16 patches** and processes them like tokens in NLP.
2. The `CLS token` (first token) represents the entire image’s feature vector.
3. The output is a **768-dimensional vector** (for `vit-base`).

## **3. Comparing CNN vs. ViT Feature Extraction**

| Model | Approach | Feature Vector Size | Libraries |
|-------|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **CNN (ResNet18)** | Convolutional layers + pooling | 1000 (ImageNet classes) | `torchvision` |
| **ViT (Google ViT-Base)** | Patch embeddings + Transformer | 768 (hidden dimension) | `transformers` |

---

## **4. Applications of Image Feature Vectors**
- **Image Search**: Compare feature vectors (e.g., cosine similarity).
- **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained features for custom tasks.
- **Object Detection**: Extract regions of interest (ROI) from features.

```python
# Example: Compute similarity between two images
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Assume features1 and features2 are extracted vectors
similarity = cosine_similarity(features1, features2)
print("Similarity score:", similarity[0][0])
```

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **CNNs** (e.g., ResNet) use **convolutional layers** to extract hierarchical features.
2. **ViTs** (e.g., Google’s ViT) treat images as **patch sequences** and use **self-attention**.
3. Both convert images into **feature vectors** for downstream tasks.
