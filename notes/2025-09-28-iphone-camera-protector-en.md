It sounds like you've been working through a camera protection setup for your iPhone 14 Pro Max! Let me make sure I understand your situation correctly:

1. Your original camera lens protector (the thin one just for the lenses) broke
2. You bought a new protector, but this one is thicker and covers the entire camera bump area
3. This thicker protector made your original case incompatible because it couldn't fit properly
4. So you bought a new case that doesn't have a closed/enclosed camera area, and now everything fits perfectly together

That's actually a common issue when switching between different styles of camera protectors. The thicker camera bump protectors do require cases with more generous camera cutouts or open designs. It sounds like you found a good solution with the new case that accommodates the thicker protector while still providing protection for the rest of your phone.

How are you finding the protection level with this new setup? Some people prefer the full camera bump coverage for better drop protection, even though it requires a case change.
