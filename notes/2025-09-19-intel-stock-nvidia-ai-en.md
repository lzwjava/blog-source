### What drove Intel’s jump

1. **Nvidia’s \$5 billion investment + strategic partnership**
   Nvidia is buying \~\$5B of Intel’s common stock at about \$23.28/share, and the two companies will co-develop chips for AI data centers and PCs. ([Business Insider][1])
   This partnership gives Intel credibility, additional capital, and a pathway to integrate more into the booming AI infrastructure market. Investors clearly see this as a big positive. ([Barron's][2])

2. **Government backing**
   Before Nvidia’s move, the U.S. government announced it would take a \~10% stake in Intel. That adds political support and possibly regulatory / financial tailwinds. ([Business Insider][1])

3. **Optimism around turnaround plans & cost discipline**
   Intel has been working on cutting costs, streamlining operations, reducing workforce, and focusing on its core strengths (CPUs, AI roadmap, foundry improvements). In its recent earnings (Q2 2025), while it reported losses, some of the non-core charges and restructuring were largely one-time, and there was a sense that Intel might start improving its financials and execution. ([Intel Corporation][3])

4. **Investor sentiment / technical moves**
   Because of the above, there’s a lot of bullish sentiment flowing in: options activity, upgrading of expectations, and excitement about Intel being more relevant in AI. ([MarketBeat][4])

### Key caveats / risks still hanging

* Even with the deal and plans, Intel has had weak earnings: Q2 showed flat to slightly up revenue YoY, but big losses, and margins under pressure. ([Intel Corporation][3])
* The company still needs to deliver on manufacturing, yield, and competitiveness vs. rivals like Nvidia, AMD, TSMC. Execution risk remains high.
* Partnerships and investments don’t guarantee product success or profit. And regulatory / supply chain / chip demand risks persist.
