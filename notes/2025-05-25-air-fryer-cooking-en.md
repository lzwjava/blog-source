To cook vegetables in an air fryer, follow these steps for crispy, flavorful results:

1. **Choose Vegetables**: Opt for veggies like zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers, Brussels sprouts, or sweet potatoes. Root vegetables (e.g., carrots, potatoes) may need longer cooking times.

2. **Prep the Vegetables**:
   - Wash and pat dry thoroughly to ensure crispiness.
   - Cut into uniform pieces (about 1-inch chunks or slices) for even cooking.
   - Toss with 1-2 teaspoons of oil (e.g., olive, avocado) per 2 cups of vegetables to help them crisp up and prevent sticking.
   - Season with salt, pepper, and spices like garlic powder, paprika, or Italian seasoning.

3. **Preheat the Air Fryer** (optional but recommended):
   - Set to 375–400°F (190–200°C) for 3–5 minutes. Preheating helps with even cooking.

4. **Cook in Batches**:
   - Place vegetables in a single layer in the air fryer basket, avoiding overcrowding to ensure proper air circulation.
   - Cook at 375–400°F (190–200°C) for 8–15 minutes, depending on the vegetable:
     - **Soft veggies** (zucchini, bell peppers): 8–10 minutes.
     - **Harder veggies** (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes): 10–15 minutes.
   - Shake the basket or toss the veggies halfway through to promote even browning.

5. **Check for Doneness**:
   - Vegetables should be tender and slightly crispy with golden edges. If needed, cook for an additional 2–3 minutes.

6. **Serve Immediately**: Enjoy as a side dish, in salads, or with a dip like hummus or ranch.

**Tips**:
- Frozen vegetables work too; no need to thaw, but add 2–3 minutes to the cooking time.
- Avoid very leafy greens (e.g., spinach) as they can burn or fly around in the air fryer.
- Experiment with seasonings like chili powder, cumin, or parmesan for variety.
- Clean the basket after each use to prevent sticking in future cooks.

Cooking **beef leg** (commonly referred to as **beef shank** or **round**, depending on the specific cut) in an air fryer can yield a flavorful, tender result with a crispy exterior, but it requires careful preparation due to the cut’s toughness. Beef shank, often used for slow braising, can be adapted for air frying with some tweaks. Below is a guide to cook beef leg (assuming beef shank or round) in an air fryer:

### Ingredients:
- 1–2 lbs (0.5–1 kg) beef leg (shank or round, trimmed to fit your air fryer)
- 1–2 tsp olive oil or avocado oil
- Seasoning: Salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, or a steak seasoning blend
- Optional: 1–2 tbsp broth, soy sauce, or BBQ sauce for moisture and flavor
- Optional marinade: Soy sauce, garlic, ginger, or Worcestershire sauce (marinate for 4–12 hours for extra flavor)

### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Beef Leg**:
   - **Trim and Portion**: If using beef shank, trim excess fat or connective tissue. For round cuts (e.g., top round), cut into smaller steaks or chunks (1–1.5 inches thick) to fit the air fryer basket. Shank may need to be cut into smaller pieces due to its size.
   - **Pat Dry**: Use paper towels to remove moisture for better browning.
   - **Season**: Rub with oil, then coat evenly with your seasoning mix. For shank, consider bold flavors like rosemary, thyme, or cumin to complement its richness. For round, a simple salt-and-pepper rub works well.
   - Optional: Marinate overnight in the fridge for deeper flavor, then pat dry before cooking.

2. **Preheat the Air Fryer**:
   - Set to 380°F (190°C) for 3–5 minutes to ensure even cooking and a good sear.

3. **Cook the Beef Leg**:
   - **Arrange in Basket**: Place the beef in a single layer, ensuring pieces don’t overlap for proper air circulation. If using shank with bone, place bone-side down.
   - **Cooking Time**:
     - **Beef Shank**: Cook at 380°F (190°C) for 20–25 minutes per pound, flipping halfway. For a 1-lb piece, expect 20–25 minutes total; for a 2-lb piece, 40–50 minutes.
     - **Beef Round (steak or chunks)**: Cook at 400°F (200°C) for 8–12 minutes for medium-rare (135°F/57°C internal temperature), flipping halfway. Adjust time for desired doneness (medium: 140°F/60°C, well-done: 160°F/71°C).
   - **Optional Moisture**: For shank, add a tablespoon of broth or soy sauce to the basket (if your model allows) to prevent drying out. For round, brush with BBQ sauce in the last 2–3 minutes for a glaze.
   - Shake or flip the meat halfway through to ensure even browning.

4. **Check Doneness**:
   - Use a meat thermometer to confirm the internal temperature:
     - **Medium-rare**: 135°F (57°C)
     - **Medium**: 140°F (60°C)
     - **Well-done**: 160°F (71°C)
   - Shank may remain tougher unless cooked longer (see step 5). Round should be tender if sliced thinly after cooking.

5. **Optional for Tenderness (Especially for Shank)**:
   - Beef shank is naturally tough due to connective tissue. If it’s not tender enough after air frying, wrap it tightly in aluminum foil with 1–2 tbsp of broth or sauce. Return to the air fryer at 300°F (150°C) for 15–20 minutes to mimic braising.
   - Alternatively, finish in an oven at 275°F (135°C) for 1–2 hours for melt-in-your-mouth texture, if time allows.

6. **Rest and Serve**:
   - Let the beef rest for 5–10 minutes under foil to retain juices.
   - **For Shank**: Slice thinly against the grain or shred for dishes like tacos, stews, or sandwiches.
   - **For Round**: Slice thinly for steaks or cube for stir-fries or salads.
   - Serve with air-fried vegetables (like those from the previous guide), mashed potatoes, or a dipping sauce like chimichurri or gravy.

### Tips:
- **Size Consideration**: Air fryers have limited space, so ensure the beef leg piece fits comfortably. A 1–2 lb portion is ideal for most models.
- **Crispier Finish**: For a crusty exterior, sear the beef in a hot skillet for 1–2 minutes per side before air frying.
- **Flavor Variations**:
   - **Asian-inspired**: Marinate with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and sesame oil.
   - **Western-style**: Use a BBQ rub and finish with BBQ sauce.
   - **Mediterranean**: Season with oregano, lemon zest, and garlic.
- **Don’t Overcook**: Round cuts dry out easily, so monitor the internal temperature closely.
- **Leftovers**: Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the air fryer at 320°F (160°C) for 5–7 minutes.

### Notes:
- **Beef Shank vs. Round**: Shank is tougher and benefits from longer, slower cooking, so the air fryer is better for smaller, thinner pieces or as a finishing tool after braising. Round cuts (like top or bottom round) are leaner and work well as steaks or chunks in the air fryer.
- **Air Fryer Limitations**: For traditional tender brisket-like results, shank is better suited to slow cooking or pressure cooking. Use the air fryer for a quicker cook or to add a crispy exterior.
- **Model Variations**: Cooking times may vary based on your air fryer’s wattage and size. Check progress periodically.
