In mainland China, neither the C1 nor C2 driver's license category is for motorcycles. Both are designated for light motor vehicles (cars):

- **C1**: Covers standard light motor vehicles like small cars and campers (up to 9 passengers or less). It's the most common car license.
- **C2**: Specifically for automatic transmission light motor vehicles (a subset of C1, often for those who only want to drive automatics).

Motorcycles fall under separate categories:
- **D**: Ordinary three-wheel motorcycles (over 50cc displacement and 50 km/h speed).
- **E**: Ordinary two-wheel motorcycles (over 50cc displacement and 50 km/h speed; this is the standard for most full-sized bikes).
- **F**: Light motorcycles (50cc or less displacement and 50 km/h or less speed; for smaller scooters).

To get a motorcycle license, you typically apply for D, E, or F based on the bike type, with age requirements starting at 18 (up to 60 for D/E, 70 for F). The process involves theory and practical tests at a local traffic management bureau.
