I couldn’t find any credible source that confirms you can use a **WeChat mini program** to directly export your *border / entry-exit / travel records* for the purpose of a bank account opening in Hong Kong.

Here’s what I discovered, plus what your best approach likely is:

---

## What I found: official channels & limitations

* Hong Kong’s Immigration Department has an official procedure: you can request a **Statement of Travel Records** (i.e. records of your arrival/departure through Hong Kong immigration) via their website. ([Immigration Department Hong Kong][1])

  * You submit identity documents, pay a fee (HK$160), and it takes about 10 working days. ([Hong Kong Government][2])
  * This is the recognized record that banks would accept as proof of your travel history in Hong Kong. ([Hong Kong Government][2])

* I found no evidence that WeChat or any WeChat mini program is integrated with the Hong Kong immigration system in a way that allows exporting or verifying your Hong Kong entry/exit data.

* Some banks (in Mainland China or linking with Hong Kong / GBA services) have WeChat mini programs for appointment booking, document submission, or cross-border services, but not for immigration record extraction. For example, HSBC has a GBA WeChat mini program for corporate account services. ([business.hsbc.com.cn][3])

* Also, HSBC Hong Kong stopped providing some services via their WeChat mini program / binding as of July 2022. ([hsbc.com.hk][4])

## Why it’s unlikely feasible via WeChat mini program

* **Data source**: Border / immigration records are controlled by the Hong Kong Immigration Department, and they don’t appear to provide a public API or service for WeChat to fetch that data.

* **Privacy / security**: Such personal data is sensitive and generally not exposed via third-party platforms unless explicitly authorized by law or agreement.

* **Lack of official linkage**: I found no published integration between WeChat’s platform and Hong Kong’s Immigration Department for this purpose.

## What you *should* use instead (for bank account opening)

To present reliable and accepted border/travel records for banks in Hong Kong, here’s your best route:

1. **Request the official Statement of Travel Records** from HK Immigration Department (ID 697 form / online). ([Hong Kong Government][2])
2. Use that document (printed / certified) as your proof of your presence in Hong Kong when opening your bank account. Many banks accept it as evidence of your past HK entries/exits.
3. If the bank requests additional verification (digital or otherwise), you can ask whether they accept other documents, but it’s unlikely they’ll accept a WeChat export unless they explicitly support that.

If you like, I can check whether any bank in HK has *recently* begun accepting WeChat mini program exports or some alternative digital method (in 2025). Do you want me to check that for you?
