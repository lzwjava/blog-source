## Benchmark Performance (SWE-bench)

This reflects how well models perform on software engineering tasks:

* **Claude 4 Opus (May 14, 2025)**: 67.60
* **GPT‑5 (Aug 7, 2025, medium reasoning)**: 65.00
* **Claude 4 Sonnet (May 14, 2025)**: 64.93 ([SWE-bench][1])

**Takeaway**: Claude 4 Opus leads slightly in SWE-bench performance, followed closely by GPT-5 and Claude-Sonnet.

## Quick Comparison Highlights

* **Best performance**: Claude 4 Opus slightly outperforms both GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet in coding benchmarks.
* **Lowest cost per token**:

  * **GPT-5 Nano** is the cheapest by far—perfect for lightweight tasks like summarization.
  * **GPT-5 Mini** offers a balance of speed and affordability.
  * **GPT-5 standard** remains quite cost-effective, especially with cheap caches.
* **Claude models**, both Opus and Sonnet, are significantly more expensive per token but justify their pricing via stronger reasoning and agent capabilities.

---

## Summary (clear and concise):

* **Claude 4 Opus**: Top performance, high cost (\$15 in / \$75 out).
* **GPT-5 (full)**: Great performance (just behind Opus), much cheaper (\$1.25 in / \$10 out).
* **GPT-5 Mini**: Mid-tier budget-friendly option (\$0.25 in / \$2 out).
* **GPT-5 Nano**: Ideal for lightweight tasks or large-scale low-cost use (\$0.05 in / \$0.40 out).
* **Claude 4 Sonnet**: Middle-ground cost/performance (\$3 in / \$15 out), but benchmark slightly below the others.
