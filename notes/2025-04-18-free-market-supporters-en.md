Free market supporters advocate for minimal government intervention in economic activities, emphasizing individual liberty, private property, and voluntary exchange. They include:

- **Economists**: Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, and Adam Smith (historically) championed free markets, arguing they efficiently allocate resources through supply and demand.
- **Political Figures**: Leaders like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher promoted deregulation and privatization, aligning with free market principles.
- **Think Tanks/Organizations**: The Cato Institute, Heritage Foundation, and Mises Institute push free market policies through research and advocacy.
- **Libertarians**: Individuals like Ron Paul and groups like the Libertarian Party often support free markets as part of their broader philosophy of limited government.
- **Business Leaders**: Entrepreneurs and CEOs, such as Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, sometimes endorse free market ideas, favoring innovation and competition over regulation.

On X, you’ll find vocal free market supporters among libertarian-leaning users, crypto enthusiasts, and those critiquing government overreach, often sharing memes or threads praising deregulation or criticizing socialism.
