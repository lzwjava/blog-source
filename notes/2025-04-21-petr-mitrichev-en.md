Ahhh, **Petr Mitrichev** — the *OG legend*, the *grandmaster of grandmasters*, and probably the most complete competitive programmer in history. If Gennady is the GOAT of the current era, **Petr was the king before him**, and honestly, still sits on the Mount Rushmore of CP.

Here’s what makes Petr Mitrichev so insanely good:

---

### 🧠 1. **Insanely Smart, Like Genius-Level**
- His raw intelligence is off the charts. He’s not just a programmer—he’s a **mathematician and algorithmist** in the truest sense.
- He competed in both math and informatics Olympiads and did extremely well in both.

---

### 🧒 2. **Started Young, Peaked Early — and Stayed There**
- Won **IOI gold medals** back in the early 2000s.
- By age 20, he was already winning major international competitions like **TopCoder Open** and **Google Code Jam**.

---

### 🏆 3. **Dominated *All* Major Contests**
He’s one of the **very few people** who has won:
- **Google Code Jam** (multiple times)
- **TopCoder Open**
- **Facebook Hacker Cup**
- **ICPC World Finals** (with Moscow State University)
- Multiple **Russian National Olympiads**

This level of dominance across platforms **for over a decade** is practically unheard of.

---

### 🧰 4. **Master of All Problem Types**
- Whether it’s geometry, number theory, combinatorics, data structures, dynamic programming, or ad-hoc problems—**Petr can do it all**.
- Some coders have a "style" or "preference"—Petr is just **universally great** at everything.

---

### ⚡ 5. **Fast, But Thoughtful**
- He may not be the fastest typist or clicker (like Gennady or Radewoosh), but his strength is his **deep thinking and accuracy**.
- When Petr submits, **it’s usually correct**. He has this incredible patience and clarity that lets him see through complex problem statements.

---

### 🧘‍♂️ 6. **Calm and Composed**
- Never flashy, never rattled. Even in the most intense contests, Petr is **serene**.
- This calmness under pressure lets him perform consistently at the top for **20+ years**.

---

### 💼 7. **Works at Google as a Researcher**
- He balances competitive programming with a career in research and engineering at Google, where he applies the same problem-solving skills.
- This shows he’s not just a "contest grinder" but a true computer scientist.

---

### 🧪 8. **Lifelong Learner**
- Even now, he blogs, streams, and shares his thought process.
- He’s still active in Codeforces rounds and educational contests, showing he’s always learning, always refining.

---

### 🏛️ Legacy
- Petr was the standard that **everyone else** measured themselves against before Gennady.
- Even Gennady has openly **admired and respected** Petr as a formative influence.
