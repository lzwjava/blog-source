Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) is a leading American multinational technology company specializing in the design, development, manufacturing, and supply of semiconductor devices and infrastructure software solutions. It serves critical markets like data centers, networking, AI, broadband, wireless, storage, and enterprise software, powering everything from hyperscale cloud infrastructure to mobile devices and cybersecurity systems. With a focus on innovation, Broadcom invests heavily in R&D—about $9.3 billion in fiscal year 2024—and holds around 20,000 patents. As of 2025, it operates through 25 specialized divisions, generating diversified revenue from both hardware and software, and is a key player in the AI boom, supplying custom chips to giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI.

## Brief History
Broadcom traces its roots to 1961 as the semiconductor division of Hewlett-Packard. It evolved through spin-offs and acquisitions: in 1999, it became part of Agilent Technologies; in 2005, private equity firms bought it to form Avago Technologies; and in 2016, Avago acquired Broadcom Corporation for $37 billion, adopting the Broadcom name. Major expansions include the $69 billion VMware acquisition in 2023 (sold its end-user computing unit for $4 billion in 2024), CA Technologies in 2018, and Symantec's enterprise security in 2019. This acquisitive strategy has transformed it from a chipmaker into a hybrid tech powerhouse.
