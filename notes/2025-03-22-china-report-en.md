## 2. Economic Landscape and GDP Distribution

### Economic Structure

China’s economy is one of the largest and most complex in the world, characterized by a mix of state-owned enterprises, private businesses, and a rapidly expanding consumer market. The country’s gross domestic product (GDP) is distributed across several key sectors:

- **Primary Sector (Agriculture):**  
  Although agriculture now accounts for a smaller share of GDP compared to previous decades, it remains vital for employing millions of rural workers and ensuring food security. Major products include rice, wheat, vegetables, and livestock.

- **Secondary Sector (Industry and Manufacturing):**  
  This sector has been the driving force behind China’s rapid economic growth over the past few decades. Key areas include:
  - **Manufacturing:** Producing electronics, machinery, textiles, automobiles, and consumer goods.
  - **Heavy Industry:** Steel, coal, and other raw materials form the backbone of industrial production.
  - **Construction:** Rapid urbanization has spurred large-scale construction projects and infrastructure development.

- **Tertiary Sector (Services):**  
  The services sector is expanding as China transitions toward a more consumer-driven economy. Financial services, retail, tourism, education, and healthcare are growing rapidly, contributing an increasingly significant share to the GDP.

### Wealth and Regional Disparities

China’s economic growth has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, yet wealth distribution remains uneven. Coastal regions like Guangdong, Shanghai, and Beijing are highly developed and economically vibrant, whereas many inland areas still face challenges. Despite these disparities, China’s overall GDP per capita has been rising steadily, reflecting improvements in living standards.
