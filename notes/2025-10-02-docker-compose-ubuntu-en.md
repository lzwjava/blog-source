Based on your system information, you're running **Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS** on an **x86_64** architecture. To download the appropriate **Docker Compose** binary for your system from the provided GitHub release (v2.39.4), you should select the binary compatible with Linux on x86_64.

### Recommended Download
You should download the **docker-compose-linux-x86_64** binary, which is not explicitly listed in the provided assets but is implied as a standard binary for Linux x86_64 systems in Docker Compose releases. However, from the assets listed, the closest match for your system is:

- **docker-compose-linux-aarch64** is **not** suitable because it is for ARM64 (aarch64) architecture, and your system is x86_64.
- The **darwin** binaries (e.g., `docker-compose-darwin-x86_64`) are for macOS, not Linux.
- The source code options (`Source code (zip)` or `Source code (tar.gz)`) require manual compilation, which is unnecessary since a precompiled binary is typically available.

Since the **docker-compose-linux-x86_64** binary is not explicitly listed in your provided assets but is standard for Docker Compose releases, you can likely find it in the full list of assets on the GitHub release page. If it's not available, you can use the source code or install Docker Compose via an alternative method (e.g., package manager or pip).

### Steps to Download and Install
1. **Confirm the Binary**: Visit the GitHub release page for v2.39.4 to confirm the availability of `docker-compose-linux-x86_64`. The release page is typically at:
   [Docker Compose v2.39.4 Release](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.39.4)

2. **Download the Binary**:
   If `docker-compose-linux-x86_64` is available, download it. For example:
   ```bash
   curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.39.4/docker-compose-linux-x86_64" -o docker-compose
   ```

3. **Verify the Download**:
   Use the provided checksum to verify the integrity of the downloaded file. For example, if the `docker-compose-linux-x86_64.sha256` file is available:
   ```bash
   echo "<sha256> docker-compose" | sha256sum --check
   ```
   Replace `<sha256>` with the appropriate hash from the release assets (e.g., `df7ff3dd8080134b851e1e49265028697d27de71f9bdc187e3d833357b934f36` for `docker-compose-darwin-x86_64.sha256`, but you need the Linux equivalent).

4. **Install the Binary**:
   Move the binary to a directory in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`:
   ```bash
   chmod +x docker-compose
   sudo mv docker-compose /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

5. **Verify Installation**:
   Check the installed version:
   ```bash
   docker-compose --version
   ```
   It should output `Docker Compose version v2.39.4`.

### Alternative Installation Method
If the `docker-compose-linux-x86_64` binary is not available or you prefer a simpler method, you can install Docker Compose using the package manager or pip, as your system has Python 3.13.4 installed:

#### Via Package Manager (Recommended for Ubuntu)
Docker Compose is often available in Ubuntu's repositories or Docker's official repository:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin
```
This installs the Docker Compose plugin, which is the modern way to use Docker Compose (as `docker compose` rather than `docker-compose`). Note that the version in Ubuntu's repository might not be exactly v2.39.4, so check with:
```bash
docker compose version
```

#### Via pip (Python)
Since you have Python 3.13.4, you can install Docker Compose via pip:
```bash
pip3 install docker-compose==2.39.4
```
This installs the specific version. Verify with:
```bash
docker-compose --version
```

### Notes
- The `checksums.txt` file (SHA256: `1a9c3370b88825ab2b229bb90eda6f703d84018ea1d56b5ba573f8893c9ab6b4`) can be used to verify the integrity of the downloaded files.
- If you choose to compile from source (`Source code (zip)` or `Source code (tar.gz)`), you'll need Go (not listed in your system info) and additional setup, which is more complex and not recommended unless necessary.
- The release includes improvements and fixes (e.g., support for `develop.watch.initial_sync`, volume ls without a project, and TLS for bake), which are relevant if you're using these features.
