The meat from **native pigs** (土猪, local/indigenous breeds) and **normal/commercial pork** (from industrial pig breeds like Yorkshire, Landrace, or Duroc) differs in several key aspects, including flavor, texture, fat content, and farming methods. Here’s a detailed comparison:  

### **1. Flavor**  
- **Native pig meat**:  
  - Richer, more intense "porky" flavor due to slower growth, varied diet (e.g., forage, grains), and higher intramuscular fat.  
  - Often described as sweeter or more aromatic (e.g., Chinese indigenous breeds like **Black Pig** or **Jinhua Ham pigs**).  
- **Commercial pork**:  
  - Milder taste, as modern breeds are optimized for lean meat and fast growth. Feed is standardized (corn/soy-based), reducing flavor complexity.  

### **2. Texture & Fat Distribution**  
- **Native pig meat**:  
  - Firmer texture due to more exercise (free-range or semi-free-range farming).  
  - **Higher intramuscular fat (marbling)**, making it juicier (e.g., like Iberico pork).  
  - Thicker, creamier fat layer (skin-on cuts are prized in Chinese cuisine).  
- **Commercial pork**:  
  - Softer, more uniform texture (bred for tenderness).  
  - Leaner with less marbling (fat is often trimmed).  

### **3. Farming & Growth Time**  
- **Native pigs**:  
  - Raised **free-range** or semi-free-range, often for **6–12+ months** (longer muscle development = more flavor).  
  - Fed natural diets (vegetables, kitchen scraps, acorns, etc.).  
- **Commercial pigs**:  
  - Raised in confined spaces, slaughtered at **5–6 months** for efficiency.  
  - Fed controlled diets (growth-promoting feed, sometimes antibiotics).  

### **4. Culinary Use**  
- **Native pork**: Preferred for traditional dishes where flavor matters (e.g., Chinese **char siu**, Spanish **jamón ibérico**). Fat renders beautifully.  
- **Commercial pork**: Used for mass-market products (e.g., sausages, cheap chops), where consistency and low cost are priorities.  

### **5. Price & Availability**  
- Native pork is **more expensive** (rare breeds, slower growth).  
- Commercial pork dominates supermarkets due to high productivity.  

**Summary**: Native pork is like "artisanal, heritage meat" vs. commercial pork's "fast-food equivalent." If you’ve tasted both, the difference is obvious—native pork is richer, while commercial pork is blander but more affordable.  

Would you like recommendations for specific native pig breeds? (e.g., Berkshire, Mangalitsa, or Chinese **Meishan pigs**?)
