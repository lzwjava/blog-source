The error message you're seeing indicates that the package manager (`apt`) encountered a permission issue while trying to access the downloaded package file. Specifically, it's trying to access the package as the root user, but it cannot because it's being run with elevated permissions in a way that restricts access to the file.

To resolve this issue, you have a couple of options:

### Option 1: Use a Different Directory
Move the `.deb` package to a different directory and try installing it from there. For example:

```bash
sudo mv /home/lzw/Downloads/TencentMeeting_0300000000_3.19.2.400_x86_64_default.publish.officialwebsite.deb /tmp/
sudo apt install /tmp/TencentMeeting_0300000000_3.19.2.400_x86_64_default.publish.officialwebsite.deb
```

### Option 2: Adjust Permissions Temporarily
Change the ownership of the `.deb` package file temporarily to allow the `apt` command to access it:

```bash
sudo chown root:root /home/lzw/Downloads/TencentMeeting_0300000000_3.19.2.400_x86_64_default.publish.officialwebsite.deb
sudo apt install /home/lzw/Downloads/TencentMeeting_0300000000_3.19.2.400_x86_64_default.publish.officialwebsite.deb
```

### Option 3: Download the Package Again
If you prefer, you can also try downloading the package again and ensure you have the correct permissions:

1. Remove the existing `.deb` package if it exists:
   ```bash
   rm /home/lzw/Downloads/TencentMeeting_0300000000_3.19.2.400_x86_64_default.publish.officialwebsite.deb
   ```

2. Re-download the package from the official website or source and attempt installation again.

### Example:
```bash
sudo apt install /path/to/downloaded/package.deb
```

### Additional Tips:
- Ensure that your current working directory has the necessary permissions to access the downloaded package.
- Verify that the package you downloaded is indeed a valid `.deb` package and not corrupted.

Following these steps should allow `apt` to successfully unpack and install the Tencent Meeting package.
