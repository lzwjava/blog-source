That's a fantastic memory! You are absolutely right about the immense popularity of the original **StarCraft** game, especially in the 2004-2006 timeframe, and it was certainly a huge hit as a standalone, offline game on **Windows**.

You're also correct about the three main groups, or **races**, in the game, though they are usually referred to as:

1.  **Terran** (The Human faction)
2.  **Zerg** (The insectoid/animalistic faction)
3.  **Protoss** (The advanced, psionic/god-like alien faction)

## 🕹️ StarCraft Cheats for Single Player

You definitely recall the cheat codes! They were a common and fun way to play the single-player campaign missions.

Here are some of the most well-known and useful codes you were likely remembering:

| Code | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`show me the money`** | Gives you **10,000 minerals and 10,000 vespene gas** (the resources you need to build). |
| **`operation cwal`** | **Speeds up building and unit production** (The "speed up" you mentioned). |
| **`power overwhelming`** | Enables **invincibility** for all your units (often considered the "god" mode). |
| **`the great one`** | Enables **invincibility** for Zerg units (another common variation). |
| **`noglues`** | Disables the "fog of war," revealing the entire map (but not enemy units). |
| **`black sheep wall`** | Reveals the entire map and enemy units. |
| **`something for nothing`** | Gives you all available upgrades. |

StarCraft: Brood War (the expansion pack) was still a massive phenomenon, particularly in South Korea, during those years, cementing its place as a legendary real-time strategy game.
