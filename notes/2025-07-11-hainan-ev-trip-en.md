### Trip Overview
Your 5-day trip (July 11, 7pm to July 17, 12pm) starts and ends in Guangzhou, focusing on Hainan Province (Haikou, Sanya, and Dongfang). Since you're taking your Neta EV car, you'll drive to Hai'an New Port (near Xuwen) for the ferry to Haikou's Xiuying Port, as EVs are restricted from using the older Xuwen Port (rule effective since March 20, 2025). The return will follow the same route. Total driving distance round-trip: ~1,060 km (excluding island driving). Island loop: ~920 km.

Key considerations:
- **EV-Specific**: Hainan is EV-friendly with 14+ charging stations along the coastal highway (G98) and dense networks in Haikou and Sanya (e.g., via apps like Tesla Supercharger or State Grid). Plan charges every 200-300 km; your Neta's range should handle it. No specific battery charge limits for the ferry, but ensure <80% SOC for safety. Book ferry spots early as EVs may be limited during peaks (though July is off-peak).
- **Ferry Booking**: Use WeChat mini-programs like "Qiongzhou Strait Ferry Manager" or "Hai'an Xin Port" for real-name booking (ID required). Book outbound/inbound at least 1-2 days ahead. Cost per leg: ~¥375 (car) + ¥41.5/person (passenger) + ¥30 (insurance) = ~¥446.5 for solo driver. Journey: 1.5 hours. Ferries run ~every 3 hours, 24/7.
- **General Tips**: Drive safely (highways toll ~¥200-300 round-trip). Pack ID/passport, car docs, charger cable, snacks/water. Check weather (tropical, rainy July). Book hotels with EV charging. Total estimated cost (excluding food/hotels): ¥1,500-2,000 (ferries + tolls + fuel equiv.).
- **Driving Times**: Based on highways; add 30-60 min for traffic/rest stops.
