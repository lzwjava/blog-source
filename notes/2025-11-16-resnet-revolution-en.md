ResNet (Residual Network) is one of the most important breakthroughs in deep learning history. It was introduced in 2015 by Kaiming He et al. from Microsoft Research and won the ImageNet competition that year with a stunning top-5 error rate of just 3.57% (better than human-level performance at the time).

Here’s why ResNet became such a big deal:

1. **It solved the “degradation problem” (vanishing/exploding gradients in very deep nets)**  
   Before ResNet, people thought “if 20 layers work well, 56 layers should work even better.” In practice, stacking more layers made accuracy worse — not because of overfitting, but because the optimization itself became harder. ResNet proved you could train 100+ layer networks (they showed 152 layers, later people went to 1000+ layers) and still get better performance.

2. **Residual blocks + skip connections (the key idea)**  
   Instead of asking the layer to learn H(x) directly, ResNet learns the residual F(x) = H(x) − x, so the block computes x + F(x).  
   Mathematically:  
   y = F(x, {W_i}) + x  
   This “identity shortcut” allows gradients to flow directly through the network via the skip connections, making extremely deep training possible.

3. **Immediate and massive practical impact**  
   - Became the backbone of almost all state-of-the-art vision models from 2016 to ~2020 (and still widely used today).  
   - Used in object detection (Faster R-CNN + ResNet), segmentation (DeepLab, Mask R-CNN), generative models (StyleGAN, etc.), video, medical imaging, etc.  
   - Variants like ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNeXt, Wide ResNet, and ResNet-RS are still standard baselines in 2025.

4. **Enabled the entire “deep learning gets really deep” era**  
   Before ResNet: best ImageNet models were ~20–30 layers (VGG, GoogLeNet).  
   After ResNet: 100–1000+ layers became normal. This depth was crucial for learning richer features.

5. **Extremely simple idea, yet transformative**  
   The paper is famously clean and only adds one clever trick (skip connections + element-wise addition). No new fancy activations, no new loss functions — just architectural insight.

In short: ResNet proved that “deeper is better” really can work if you design the architecture properly, and it became the default starting point for almost every computer vision model for the next decade.

Even today in 2025, when Transformers and ConvNeXt/ViT-based models dominate leaderboards, ResNet-50 is still the most common benchmark backbone because it’s fast, well-understood, and extremely reliable.
