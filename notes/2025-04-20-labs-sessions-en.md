### **3. Labs and Practical Sessions**

#### **Basic Labs**

**1. Assembly Programming (Keyboard Input/Display Output)**

- **Objective**: 
   The primary goal of this lab is to learn how to write assembly programs that handle basic input and output operations on a microcomputer.
  
- **Key Concepts**: 
   - Understanding the **assembly language syntax**.
   - Interaction with I/O ports for **keyboard input** and **display output**.
   - Use of **interrupts** for processing input.

- **Lab Tasks**:
   - **Keyboard Input**: Write an assembly program that captures a key press from the keyboard and stores it in a register.
   - **Display Output**: Program the system to display the captured key on a 7-segment LED display or an LCD screen.
   - **Program Control**: Implement simple program flow like looping or conditional jumps based on user input.

- **Tools**: Microcontroller (e.g., 8051, PIC), development environments like **Keil** or **MPLAB**, hardware interfaces like **LED displays** or **LCDs**, and **keyboard interfaces**.

**2. 8255A-Controlled LED/Keyboard Experiments**

- **Objective**: 
   This lab focuses on interfacing the **8255A Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI)** with LEDs and a keyboard. This chip helps in managing the input/output operations, which is essential for efficient microcomputer systems.

- **Key Concepts**:
   - **8255A Interface**: Learn to program and interface the 8255A chip for controlling input/output devices.
   - **Port Modes**: 8255A offers three modes of operation — **Input Mode**, **Output Mode**, and **Bidirectional Mode**. The lab emphasizes configuring the chip to use these modes effectively.
   - **LED Control**: Implement the use of LEDs to visualize the results of inputs processed by the system.

- **Lab Tasks**:
   - **LED Control**: Develop a program that turns on/off specific LEDs connected to the 8255A chip.
   - **Keyboard Interface**: Interface a **keypad** or **keyboard matrix** to the system, enabling the user to input data, which can then be displayed via LEDs or processed further.
   - **Program Control**: Learn how to handle **keyboard scanning** and **debouncing**, ensuring accurate key detection.

- **Tools**: 8255A chip, **microcontroller development kits**, keyboard, LED arrays, and **software for configuring and programming the 8255A chip** (e.g., **Keil** or **MPLAB**).

#### **Comprehensive Labs**

**1. Interrupt-Based Traffic Light Control System**

- **Objective**: 
   The main objective here is to build a traffic light system controlled by **interrupts**. This lab focuses on real-time control, using interrupts to manage different traffic light states efficiently.

- **Key Concepts**:
   - **Interrupt Handling**: Learn to implement interrupt service routines (ISRs) to manage traffic light transitions.
   - **Traffic Light Control**: Control multiple LEDs representing the red, yellow, and green lights.
   - **Timer Interrupts**: Use **timer interrupts** to switch between different traffic light states at predefined intervals.

- **Lab Tasks**:
   - **Design Traffic Light System**: Use microcontrollers and LEDs to design a working traffic light system with multiple phases (e.g., red, yellow, green).
   - **Interrupt Service Routines (ISR)**: Develop ISRs to switch the lights based on time or external triggers (e.g., pedestrian request button).
   - **Synchronization**: Ensure that the transitions between the lights occur smoothly, preventing unsafe intersections.

- **Tools**: Microcontroller, **LED arrays** (for traffic lights), **timers**, **interrupt controllers**, and development environments (e.g., **Keil**, **MPLAB**).

**2. Serial Communication (Data Transmission/Reception)**

- **Objective**: 
   This lab introduces **serial communication**, which is essential for data exchange between microcontrollers or computers and external devices.

- **Key Concepts**:
   - **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)**: Understand the operation of the **UART protocol** for serial communication.
   - **Data Frames**: Learn about the structure of data packets in serial communication (start bit, data bits, stop bits, parity).
   - **Communication Protocols**: Implement protocols like **RS232**, **RS485**, or **TTL-level communication** for sending and receiving data.

- **Lab Tasks**:
   - **Implement UART Communication**: Write assembly or C programs to send and receive data serially between two microcontrollers or a microcontroller and a computer.
   - **Error Detection**: Learn how to implement **parity checking**, **framing errors**, and **overrun errors** in the communication process.
   - **Data Transfer**: Use serial communication to transfer simple data like text, numbers, or control signals between devices.

- **Tools**: Microcontroller with built-in UART support (e.g., **8051**, **PIC**, or **AVR**), **serial interface modules** (e.g., **MAX232** for RS232), development environments (**Keil**, **MPLAB**, etc.).
