Yes — HSBC Hong Kong does issue **physical UnionPay debit cards**, and they work much like other bank-issued debit cards but with the **UnionPay network** instead of Visa or Mastercard.

Here’s what it is and how you can use it:

---

**1. What it is**

* A **physical plastic debit card** linked directly to your HSBC HK account (usually HKD savings/current, or multi-currency accounts like HSBC One).
* Runs on **UnionPay International** — China’s largest bank card payment network.
* Looks similar to a credit card but deducts funds **instantly** from your account balance, not from a credit line.

---

**2. What you can use it for**

* **ATM withdrawals**: Use at HSBC ATMs in HK, Mainland China, and overseas ATMs with the UnionPay logo.
* **In-store purchases**: Pay at any merchant that accepts UnionPay (common in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and increasingly in other countries).
* **Online payments**: Works on websites that support UnionPay Online Payment (UPOP).
* **Contactless payment**: Many HSBC UnionPay debit cards have UnionPay QuickPass for tap-to-pay in stores.
* **Multi-currency use**: If linked to a multi-currency account, it can deduct the payment directly in that currency when supported.

---

**3. Key points to note**

* **No credit function** — it uses your deposited funds.
* **UnionPay acceptance is huge in China** but less common than Visa/Mastercard in some Western countries.
* **Security** — HSBC provides SMS/email alerts and spending limits; you can also lock/unlock the card in the HSBC HK mobile app.
* **Fees** — ATM withdrawal overseas may incur currency conversion or service fees unless you use HSBC ATMs.

If you want, I can explain **how this HSBC UnionPay debit card links to HSBC One** and how it’s different from HSBC’s Visa debit card. Would you like me to do that next?
