### Richard Stallman: The Open Source Fighter

Richard Matthew Stallman, often known by his initials RMS, is a pioneering computer programmer, software freedom activist, and the founder of the free software movement. Born on March 16, 1953, in New York City, Stallman has dedicated his life to promoting the idea that software should be free as in "freedom" (not just price)—meaning users should have the right to run, study, modify, and distribute it without restrictions. He's often called the "father of free software" and a relentless fighter against proprietary software, earning him the nickname "the open source fighter" for his uncompromising stance on digital rights.

#### Early Life and Spark of Activism
Stallman grew up in a middle-class family and showed an early aptitude for hacking and programming. He attended Harvard University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in physics in 1974, but his passion lay in computers. He moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Lab in the early 1970s, immersing himself in the hacker culture of the time—a collaborative, sharing ethos that contrasted sharply with the emerging commercial software industry.

A pivotal moment came in 1976 when Stallman discovered that a printer at the AI Lab had been replaced by a proprietary model that restricted user access to its code. This "betrayal" of the open-sharing spirit ignited his activism. He left MIT in 1984 to focus full-time on creating a free operating system alternative to Unix, which he named GNU (a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix").

#### Key Contributions to Free and Open Source Software
Stallman's legacy is etched into the digital world through several groundbreaking initiatives:

- **The GNU Project (1983)**: Stallman launched this ambitious effort to develop a completely free Unix-like operating system. GNU provided essential tools like the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), Emacs text editor (which he co-authored), and the Bash shell. Today, GNU components power most Linux distributions, forming the backbone of open source ecosystems.

- **The GNU General Public License (GPL, 1985)**: This "copyleft" license became Stallman's most revolutionary weapon. Unlike permissive licenses, the GPL requires that any derivative works remain free and open, ensuring software freedom propagates. It's used by over half of all open source projects and has influenced laws worldwide.

- **Free Software Foundation (FSF, 1985)**: Stallman co-founded the FSF to support the GNU Project and advocate for software users' rights. The organization promotes ethical computing and has been a bulwark against software patents and DRM (digital rights management).

His work laid the groundwork for the broader open source movement, though Stallman has critiqued it for prioritizing practicality over moral imperatives—preferring "free software" to "open source" to emphasize ethics over business.

#### Philosophy and Battles
Stallman's philosophy is rooted in four essential freedoms: to use, study, share, and modify software. He's a vocal critic of companies like Apple and Microsoft for their closed ecosystems, and he's campaigned against software patents, surveillance tech, and even non-software issues like meat-eating (he's a strict vegan). His speeches, often delivered in a distinctive, rambling style, blend humor, logic, and fervor, making him a polarizing figure: a hero to purists, a curmudgeon to pragmatists.

#### Controversies and Resilience
Stallman has faced backlash, notably resigning from the FSF and MIT in 2019 amid allegations of insensitive comments related to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal (he later returned to advocacy but not those roles). As of 2025, at age 72, he remains active, speaking at conferences, updating Emacs, and fighting for digital liberty through the FSF.

Stallman's impact is profound: billions use his code daily, and his ideas have shaped the internet's open ethos. As he puts it, "Free software is about cooperation, not charity." For those new to his world, start with his essays on gnu.org—they're as provocative as his code is essential.
