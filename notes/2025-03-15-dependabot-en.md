To remove Dependabot from GitHub Actions, you need to disable its ability to create pull requests that trigger workflows and, optionally, remove any custom workflows specifically tied to Dependabot. Below are the steps to achieve this. Note that I assume "dependant bot" in your query refers to "Dependabot," a common tool in GitHub for dependency management.

---

### Step 1: Disable Dependabot Version Updates
Dependabot version updates automatically create pull requests to keep your dependencies up to date. These pull requests can trigger GitHub Actions workflows. To disable this feature:

- **Locate the Configuration File**: Check your repository for a file named `dependabot.yml` in the `.github` directory.
- **Remove the File**: If it exists, delete the `dependabot.yml` file and commit this change. This stops Dependabot from creating pull requests for version updates.
- **Verify**: If no `dependabot.yml` file exists, version updates are already disabled.

---

### Step 2: Disable Dependabot Security Updates
Dependabot security updates generate pull requests to fix vulnerabilities in your dependencies, which can also trigger GitHub Actions workflows. To turn this off:

- **Go to Repository Settings**: In your GitHub repository, click on the **Settings** tab.
- **Navigate to Security Settings**: Scroll to **Security & analysis** (or **Code security and analysis**, depending on your GitHub interface).
- **Disable Security Updates**: Find **Dependabot security updates** and click **Disable**.

This prevents Dependabot from creating pull requests for security fixes.

### Step 3: (Optional) Remove Custom Dependabot-Related Workflows
If you’ve set up GitHub Actions workflows specifically to handle Dependabot pull requests (e.g., auto-merging, labeling, or using Dependabot metadata), you may want to clean them up:

- **Check Workflow Files**: Look in the `.github/workflows` directory for YAML files.
- **Identify Dependabot Logic**: Search for conditions like `if: github.event.pull_request.user.login == 'dependabot[bot]'` or actions such as `dependabot/fetch-metadata`.
- **Remove or Modify**: Delete these workflows or adjust them to remove Dependabot-specific logic, then commit the changes.

This step is optional because disabling Dependabot in Steps 1 and 2 will stop it from creating new pull requests, meaning existing workflows won’t be triggered by Dependabot anymore. However, removing these workflows ensures a complete cleanup.

---

### Additional Notes
- **Existing Pull Requests**: Disabling Dependabot doesn’t close existing pull requests it created. These may still trigger workflows if updated. You can manually close them if needed.
- **Dependabot Alerts**: If you also want to stop vulnerability notifications (not directly tied to GitHub Actions), go to **Settings > Security & analysis** and disable **Dependabot alerts**. This is optional and unrelated to workflow triggers.

---

### Result
By completing Steps 1 and 2, Dependabot will no longer create pull requests in your repository, effectively "removing" its influence on GitHub Actions. If you’ve customized workflows for Dependabot, Step 3 ensures all related automation is gone. Your GitHub Actions will now only run based on other events, unaffected by Dependabot.
