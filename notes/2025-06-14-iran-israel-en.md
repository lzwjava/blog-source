The conflict between Iran and Israel, as of June 14, 2025, is rooted in a mix of historical, ideological, and geopolitical factors that have fueled tensions for decades, escalating recently into direct confrontations. Here’s a breakdown of why they are fighting now, based on available information and critical analysis:

### Historical and Ideological Roots
- **Post-1979 Hostility**: Before 1979, Iran and Israel had relatively cooperative relations under the Shah, driven by shared interests against Arab powers. The 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, drastically shifted Iran’s stance. The new Islamic Republic adopted an anti-Israel ideology, rejecting Israel’s legitimacy and labeling it the “Little Satan” (with the U.S. as the “Great Satan”). Iran began supporting anti-Israel groups like Hezbollah and Hamas to challenge Israeli influence.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%25E2%2580%2593Israel_relations)[](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/12/1244281886/iran-israel-relations-enemies-gaza-war)
- **Opposing Visions**: Iran’s theocratic regime seeks regional dominance and supports a network of militias (the “Axis of Resistance”) to counter Israel and Western influence. Israel, viewing Iran as an existential threat due to its nuclear ambitions and support for hostile groups, aims to curb Iran’s regional power and prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons.[](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/world/middleeast/israel-iran-conflict-history.html)[](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/confrontation-between-united-states-and-iran)

### Recent Escalations (2023–2025)
The current fighting stems from a series of tit-for-tat actions, moving the conflict from proxy wars to direct military engagements:
- **October 2023 Hamas Attack**: On October 7, 2023, Hamas, backed by Iran, launched a massive attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking hostages. Iran reportedly assisted in planning, escalating tensions. Israel responded with intense military operations in Gaza, targeting Hamas, which further inflamed Iran’s rhetoric.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Iran%25E2%2580%2593Israel_conflict)[](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/confrontation-between-united-states-and-iran)
- **Israeli Strikes on Iranian Targets**: Israel intensified attacks on Iranian assets, particularly in Syria. On December 25, 2023, Israel killed IRGC commander Razi Mousavi in Damascus. On April 1, 2024, an Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus killed senior IRGC officials, including Mohammad Reza Zahedi, prompting Iran to vow retaliation.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Iran%25E2%2580%2593Israel_conflict)[](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/israel-iran-escalation-syria-zahedi/)
- **Iran’s Direct Attacks**: On April 13, 2024, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel, firing over 300 drones and missiles in retaliation for the Damascus strike. Most were intercepted by Israel and its allies (U.S., UK, France, Jordan). Israel responded with limited strikes on Iranian military targets on April 19, signaling de-escalation.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Iran%25E2%2580%2593Israel_conflict)[](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/confrontation-between-united-states-and-iran)
- **October 2024 Missile Barrage**: On October 1, 2024, Iran fired around 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, retaliating for the assassinations of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and an IRGC commander. Israel’s air defenses, supported by U.S. forces, intercepted most missiles, but the attack marked a significant escalation.[](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68811276)[](https://x.com/AP/status/1841156686330954174)[](https://x.com/AP/status/1841167541873369555)
- **Israel’s October 2024 Strikes**: On October 26, 2024, Israel conducted airstrikes on Iranian missile production and air defense sites, avoiding nuclear or oil facilities to limit escalation. Iran downplayed the damage, reporting one civilian and four soldiers killed, and promised a “powerful” response.[](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr0yvrx4qpo)[](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosions-heard-iran-syria-middle-east-braces-israeli-retaliation-2024-10-25/)
- **June 2025 Nuclear Strikes**: On June 13, 2025, Israel launched a major attack on Iran’s nuclear and military facilities, following the IAEA’s declaration that Iran violated nuclear obligations. This was driven by Israel’s fear of Iran’s advancing nuclear program, especially amid stalled U.S.-Iran nuclear talks. Iran’s response remains unclear, but the strike heightened fears of a broader war.[](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/world/middleeast/israel-iran-conflict-history.html)[](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/iran/live-blog/israel-strikes-iran-middle-east-conflict-live-updates-rcna212727)[](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/israel-considering-military-strike-iran-sources-say-rcna212528)

### Key Drivers of the Current Conflict
1. **Iran’s Nuclear Program**: Israel views Iran’s uranium enrichment and potential nuclear weapon development as a red line. Recent Israeli strikes targeted nuclear facilities to set back Iran’s capabilities, especially as U.S.-Iran nuclear negotiations faltered.[](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/iran/live-blog/israel-strikes-iran-middle-east-conflict-live-updates-rcna212727)[](https://time.com/7287313/iran-israel-strike-report-nuclear-us-trump-history-context-explainer/)
2. **Proxy Warfare**: Iran supports Hezbollah, Hamas, and other groups (e.g., Houthis in Yemen) to attack Israel indirectly. Israel’s assassinations of proxy leaders (e.g., Nasrallah in September 2024) and IRGC commanders have forced Iran to respond directly to maintain credibility.[](https://www.csis.org/analysis/escalating-war-between-israel-hezbollah-and-iran)[](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68811276)
3. **Regional Power Struggle**: Iran seeks to expand its influence in the Middle East, challenging Israel and U.S.-aligned states like Saudi Arabia. Israel’s informal alliances with Arab states (e.g., via the Abraham Accords) aim to counter Iran, escalating tensions.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%25E2%2580%2593Israel_relations)[](https://www.newsweek.com/iran-israel-war-threat-middle-east-2081901)
4. **Domestic Politics**: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, facing domestic political challenges, uses the Iran threat to bolster his leadership. Iran’s hardline stance also serves to rally its base and assert regional dominance.[](https://www.newsweek.com/iran-israel-war-threat-middle-east-2081901)[](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/04/the-iran-israel-war-is-just-getting-started.html)

### Why Now?
- **Tit-for-Tat Cycle**: The killings of key figures (Haniyeh, Nasrallah, IRGC commanders) and Israel’s strikes on Iranian assets in Syria pushed Iran into direct action to restore deterrence. Israel’s response, including the June 2025 nuclear strikes, aims to weaken Iran’s military and nuclear capabilities before they grow stronger.[](https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-iran-conflict-history.html)[](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/whats-next-in-the-israel-iran-conflict)
- **Weakened Proxies**: Israel’s degradation of Hezbollah and Hamas has exposed Iran’s vulnerabilities, prompting direct engagement. Iran’s missile attacks signal a shift from proxy reliance to direct confrontation.[](https://www.csis.org/analysis/escalating-war-between-israel-hezbollah-and-iran)[](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/whats-next-in-the-israel-iran-conflict)
- **Nuclear Talks Stalemate**: The failure of U.S.-Iran nuclear negotiations, coupled with Trump’s hardline stance against Iran’s uranium enrichment, has emboldened Israel to act unilaterally, fearing a nuclear-armed Iran.[](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/iran/live-blog/israel-strikes-iran-middle-east-conflict-live-updates-rcna212727)[](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/israel-considering-military-strike-iran-sources-say-rcna212528)
- **Regional Instability**: The Gaza war and Israel’s operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah have created a volatile environment, drawing in Iran and its allies. The risk of miscalculation is high, with each side testing the other’s limits.[](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/israeli-palestinian-conflict)[](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosions-heard-iran-syria-middle-east-braces-israeli-retaliation-2024-10-25/)

### Potential Outcomes
- **Escalation Risk**: Both sides have avoided all-out war, with Israel limiting strikes to military targets and Iran downplaying responses to avoid broader conflict. However, miscalculations (e.g., civilian casualties or strikes on oil facilities) could spiral into a regional war, potentially involving the U.S., Russia, or China.[](https://www.newsweek.com/iran-israel-war-threat-middle-east-2081901)[](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/iran/live-blog/israel-strikes-iran-middle-east-conflict-live-updates-rcna212727)
- **De-escalation Efforts**: The U.S. and allies like Jordan have urged restraint, and Iran has signaled it prefers to avoid war, but ongoing proxy attacks and Israeli operations in Syria and Lebanon keep tensions high.[](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-impact-of-irans-attack-on-israel/)[](https://x.com/vali_nasr/status/1840357342971339239)
- **Global Impact**: A wider conflict could disrupt oil supplies (e.g., through the Strait of Hormuz) and destabilize the Middle East, affecting global markets and drawing in major powers.[](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/iran/live-blog/israel-strikes-iran-middle-east-conflict-live-updates-rcna212727)[](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosions-heard-iran-syria-middle-east-braces-israeli-retaliation-2024-10-25/)

### Critical Perspective
While mainstream narratives frame Iran as the aggressor due to its missile attacks and proxy support, Israel’s assassinations and strikes on Iranian soil (e.g., nuclear facilities) are provocative acts that challenge Iran’s sovereignty. Iran’s responses, though escalatory, are partly driven by the need to maintain credibility among its allies. Both sides operate in a high-stakes game where neither wants full-scale war but cannot afford to appear weak. The lack of direct communication channels increases the risk of missteps.[](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/israel-iran-escalation-syria-zahedi/)
