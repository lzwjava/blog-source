Buildings like Baiyun Lou and Luxun Guzhu in Guangzhou can last for 100 years or more due to a combination of factors related to their design, construction materials, maintenance, and environmental conditions. Here are some key reasons:

1. **Quality Construction Materials**: Traditional buildings often use durable materials like brick, stone, and timber, which can withstand the test of time. Modern buildings may use concrete, steel, and other materials that are designed to last.

2. **Structural Integrity**: Well-designed buildings have strong foundations and structural systems that can withstand environmental stresses such as earthquakes, strong winds, and heavy loads.

3. **Architectural Design**: Good architectural design, including proper load distribution and reinforcement, can contribute to longevity.

4. **Regular Maintenance**: Regular inspection and maintenance can address minor issues before they become significant, extending the lifespan of the building.

5. **Environmental Conditions**: Buildings in stable climates, with moderate temperatures and low humidity, generally fare better over time. Extreme weather conditions can hasten deterioration.

6. **Cultural and Historical Significance**: Buildings that are culturally or historically significant often receive special care and protection, which can contribute to their longevity. For example, historical preservation efforts often include regular restoration and conservation work.

7. **Modern Techniques**: Advanced construction techniques and technologies can enhance the durability of buildings. For instance, using high-quality concrete mixes, advanced reinforcing materials, and innovative insulation techniques.

8. **Adaptation to Modern Needs**: Buildings that can be easily adapted to changing needs and technologies (e.g., adding new utilities, upgrading systems) are more likely to remain functional over extended periods.

9. **Proper Ventilation and Moisture Control**: Buildings that are well-ventilated and have effective moisture control systems avoid issues like mold and rot, which can shorten the lifespan of a structure.

In the case of Baiyun Lou and Luxun Guzhu, their historical and architectural significance likely means they receive special care and attention, ensuring they remain standing for many more years to come.
