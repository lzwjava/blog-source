title: Node.js OpenSSL Legacy Provider Flag
translated: false
---

### Understanding the Issue
Node.js 16 (and earlier versions) uses OpenSSL 1.x, while Node.js 22 introduces OpenSSL 3.x, which has stricter security defaults. This can cause errors in some applications, especially those relying on legacy cryptographic providers or deprecated algorithms (e.g., MD4 hashes). The `--openssl-legacy-provider` flag temporarily enables compatibility with OpenSSL 1.x behavior to fix these issues during the upgrade.

**Note**: This flag is a workaround and may be removed in future Node.js versions. It's best for short-term fixes—update your code to use modern OpenSSL 3.x APIs when possible.

### How to Use the Flag
You can apply this flag when running Node.js directly or via npm/yarn scripts. It's a runtime option, not a permanent configuration.

#### For Direct Node Commands
Add the flag before your script or command. Examples:
- Basic script execution: `node --openssl-legacy-provider app.js`
- REPL (interactive mode): `node --openssl-legacy-provider`
- If running a module: `node --openssl-legacy-provider --input-type=module index.mjs`
- With additional flags: `node --openssl-legacy-provider --max-old-space-size=4096 script.js`

This enables legacy provider support, avoiding common errors like "digital envelope routines unsupported" (related to outdated hashes or ciphers).

#### For npm/Yarn Scripts
Modify your `package.json` under `"scripts"` to include the flag in relevant commands. Example:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node --openssl-legacy-provider app.js",
    "dev": "node --openssl-legacy-provider --watch app.js"
  }
}
```
Then run as usual: `npm start` or `yarn dev`.

If using a tool like nodemon or vite that spawns Node processes, prepend the flag in its configuration (e.g., in nodemon.json: `"exec": "node --openssl-legacy-provider"`).

#### For Global Commands (e.g., via nvm or system Node)
If you manage Node versions with nvm, switch to Node 22 and run commands with the flag as shown. For Docker or CI/CD, add it to your run scripts (e.g., `CMD ["node", "--openssl-legacy-provider", "app.js"]`).

### Troubleshooting and Alternatives
- **Verify the flag works**: Run `node --openssl-legacy-provider --version`—it should output Node 22's version without errors.
- **Common issues fixed**: Errors with `require()` of crypto modules, webpack builds, or app startups. If it persists, check for OpenSSL-specific code (e.g., use `crypto.createCipher` alternatives like `crypto.createCipheriv`).
- **Long-term solutions**: Scan for deprecated crypto usage (use tools like ESLint plugins) and update to OpenSSL 3.x-compatible methods. Node 22 docs recommend libraries like `bcrypt` or `crypto.scrypt` for hashing.
- **Performance/compatibility note**: Legacy provider mode may slightly impact security/features but helps during migration. Test thoroughly, as some OpenSSL 3 features (e.g., enhanced entropy sources) won't be available.
