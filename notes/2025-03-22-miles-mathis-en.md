title: Main Conspiracy Theories Miles Mathis Promotes
translated: false
---

Miles W. Mathis is known for his unconventional and controversial writings, spanning physics, history, and conspiracy theories. His work often challenges mainstream science and historical narratives, making him a niche but polarizing figure. Below are some of the main conspiracy theories and ideas he promotes:

---

### **1. Historical Figures Were Faked or Controlled**
Mathis argues that many well-known historical figures were not who they seemed and were either fabricated or controlled by hidden elites. Some of his most controversial claims include:

- **Shakespeare Didn’t Exist** – He argues that William Shakespeare was a front for a group of writers working under the control of intelligence agencies.
- **Hitler Was a Puppet of the Elites** – Mathis claims that Hitler was a controlled agent working for the aristocracy rather than a self-made dictator.
- **The Kennedy Assassination Was Staged** – He believes that JFK was not actually assassinated and that the entire event was a theatrical production orchestrated by intelligence agencies.

---

### **2. The Fake Death Phenomenon**
Mathis often suggests that major public figures, including celebrities, politicians, and even scientists, fake their deaths to either disappear from public life or transition into hidden roles. Some of his claims include:

- **Elvis Presley’s Death Was Faked** – He suggests that Elvis did not die in 1977 but instead went into hiding.
- **John Lennon’s Assassination Was Staged** – According to Mathis, Lennon did not actually die in 1980 but was part of a larger intelligence operation.

---

### **3. Physics and Science Cover-Ups**
Mathis also focuses on revising established scientific theories, claiming that much of modern physics is fraudulent or intentionally misleading. Some of his claims include:

- **Relativity and Quantum Mechanics Are Fake** – He dismisses much of Einstein’s work, arguing that relativity and quantum mechanics are artificially complex and designed to obscure real science.
- **Pi Is Wrong** – One of his most infamous claims is that the mathematical constant π (pi) is incorrectly defined and that the true value should be different.
- **Gravity Works Differently Than We Think** – He proposes an alternative theory of gravity that contradicts mainstream physics.

---

### **4. The Intelligence Agency Conspiracy**
A recurring theme in Mathis's work is that intelligence agencies, particularly the CIA and British intelligence, are responsible for fabricating much of modern history and science. He argues that:

- **Most Major Events Are Staged** – Whether it’s assassinations, terror attacks, or scientific breakthroughs, he suggests that these events are carefully managed by hidden powers.
- **The Media Is Entirely Controlled** – He believes that nearly all mainstream media, including academic journals, are controlled by intelligence agencies to shape public perception.

### **Conclusion**
Miles W. Mathis is a highly controversial figure whose theories reject mainstream historical and scientific consensus. While his work is dismissed by the academic community, he has a niche following that finds his perspective compelling.

- **The Romanovs Were Not Executed** – He suggests that the execution of the Russian royal family was faked and that they were relocated rather than killed.
- **Einstein Was a Fraud** – Mathis claims that Albert Einstein was not a genuine scientist but rather a front for intelligence operations and that his work on relativity was either stolen or intentionally misleading.

### **Fake or Staged Wars and Revolutions**
- **The American Revolution Was Controlled by British Elites** – He argues that the American Revolution was not a true rebellion but rather a staged event to transition power to a new ruling class while maintaining British influence.
- **World War II Was Scripted** – He believes that Hitler, Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin were all actors playing their roles in a larger geopolitical theater controlled by elites.
- **The Cold War Was a Fake Rivalry** – Mathis suggests that the United States and the Soviet Union were never truly enemies but worked together to control global populations through a fake nuclear standoff.

## **2. Celebrity Death Hoaxes & Identity Manipulation**
Mathis frequently argues that famous deaths are faked or that major celebrities assume multiple identities.

### **Fake Celebrity Deaths**
- **Paul McCartney Died and Was Replaced** – He supports the theory that the original Paul McCartney died in 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike, often referred to as "Faul."
- **John Lennon Was Not Killed** – Mathis suggests that John Lennon's assassination in 1980 was faked and that he went into hiding.
- **Kurt Cobain’s Death Was a Staged Exit** – He claims that Cobain’s suicide was a manufactured event, likely orchestrated to remove him from public life.

## **3. Science & Mathematics Conspiracies**
Mathis frequently argues that modern physics and mathematics are fraudulent or intentionally misleading.

### **Physics is a Hoax**
- **Relativity Is Fake** – He dismisses Einstein's theory of relativity as a hoax created to confuse people.
- **Gravity Works Differently** – Mathis proposes an alternative theory of gravity that contradicts Newtonian and Einsteinian physics.
- **Dark Matter and Black Holes Do Not Exist** – He believes that astrophysical phenomena like dark matter and black holes are fabrications designed to keep the public in the dark about real physics.

### **Mathematical Manipulations**
- **Pi Is Incorrect** – Mathis claims that the true value of π (pi) is not 3.14159... but something else entirely.
- **The Calculus Is Flawed** – He argues that calculus, as developed by Newton and Leibniz, contains fundamental errors that the scientific establishment refuses to acknowledge.

---

## **4. Intelligence Agencies Control Everything**
A major theme in Mathis’s work is that intelligence agencies, particularly the CIA, MI6, and Mossad, control most aspects of society.

### **Media and Entertainment Are Completely Controlled**
- **Hollywood is Run by Intelligence Agencies** – He suggests that nearly all major films and TV shows are created as propaganda tools.
