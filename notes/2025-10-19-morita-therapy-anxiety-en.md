### Core Principles of Morita Therapy

Morita Therapy, developed by Japanese psychiatrist Shoma Morita in the early 20th century, is a mindfulness-based approach primarily for treating anxiety disorders, neurosis, and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Unlike Western therapies that focus on symptom elimination or cognitive restructuring, Morita emphasizes **accepting life as it is** (arugamama, or "as-it-is-ness") and shifting attention from internal worries to purposeful action in the external world. The goal is not to cure anxiety but to live fully despite it, breaking the cycle where resistance amplifies suffering.

#### Key Principles
1. **Acceptance of Symptoms (Arugamama)**:  
   Anxiety, fears, and intrusive thoughts are natural parts of human experience—like weather or bodily sensations. Fighting them creates a vicious cycle; instead, acknowledge them without judgment and let them exist alongside daily life. For example, if you're anxious about social embarrassment, proceed with interactions anyway, treating the anxiety as background noise.

2. **Detachment from Ego-Centered Thinking**:  
   Neurosis stems from over-identifying with thoughts and self-consciousness ("What will others think?"). Morita teaches detaching from this by focusing on the present moment and external tasks, reducing the "spotlight" on one's inner world. This fosters humility and a sense of connection to others and nature.

3. **Action Over Reflection**:  
   Prioritize constructive activity regardless of feelings. Procrastination or avoidance reinforces anxiety, so engage in work and responsibilities as a way to build momentum. Morita viewed life as a flow: symptoms fade when you're absorbed in meaningful doing, not endless analysis.

4. **Holistic View of Life and Death**:  
   Embrace impermanence and the interconnectedness of all things. Suffering is inevitable, but clinging to ideals of perfection or control causes more pain. True freedom comes from aligning with life's natural rhythm, including joy, sorrow, and mortality.

#### The Four-Stage Treatment Process
Morita's inpatient program (adaptable to outpatient settings) progresses through structured phases to embody these principles:
- **Absolute Rest (1-7 days)**: Bed rest in a quiet environment to confront symptoms fully, without escape or reassurance.
- **Light Monotonous Work (1-2 weeks)**: Simple, repetitive tasks (e.g., gardening) to shift focus outward.
- **Labor (2-3 weeks)**: More demanding work to build discipline and purpose.
- **Social Integration (1 week+)**: Return to society with diaries and group discussions to reinforce acceptance.

Modern adaptations incorporate mindfulness, exposure therapy, and ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) elements. It's particularly effective for those stuck in "analysis paralysis," promoting resilience through non-resistance.
