No, the Fire TV Stick does not have the Infuse app. Infuse is a media player primarily designed for Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, and Vision, and there is no official version available for Fire TV Stick or Android TV devices. However, you can still play MKV files from another laptop on your Fire TV Stick using alternative apps and methods. Here are some options:

### 1. VLC Media Player
- **Overview**: VLC is a free, widely-used media player that supports MKV files and is available on the Fire TV Stick.
- **How to Use**:
  - Install VLC from the Amazon App Store on your Fire TV Stick.
  - Ensure your laptop and Fire TV Stick are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
  - On your laptop, share the folder containing your MKV files (e.g., through Windows File Sharing or a DLNA server).
  - Open VLC on your Fire TV Stick, go to "Network" or "Local Network," and browse to your shared files to play them.

### 2. Kodi
- **Overview**: Kodi is a powerful, customizable media player that supports MKV playback and can be installed on Fire TV Stick.
- **How to Use**:
  - Sideload Kodi onto your Fire TV Stick (search online for a guide to install it, as it’s not in the Amazon App Store).
  - Configure Kodi to access your laptop’s files via network sharing (e.g., SMB or NFS).
  - Select and play your MKV files from within Kodi.

### 3. Plex
- **Overview**: Plex is a media server solution that streams your MKV files from your laptop to your Fire TV Stick.
- **How to Use**:
  - Download and install Plex Media Server on your laptop from the official Plex website.
  - Add your MKV files to your Plex library.
  - Install the Plex app on your Fire TV Stick from the Amazon App Store.
  - Sign in to your Plex account on both devices to stream your files.

### 4. DLNA Apps
- **Overview**: Apps like "AllCast" or "BubbleUPnP" allow streaming via DLNA from your laptop to your Fire TV Stick.
- **How to Use**:
  - Set up a DLNA server on your laptop (e.g., using Windows Media Player or software like Serviio).
  - Install a DLNA-compatible app on your Fire TV Stick from the Amazon App Store.
  - Connect to your laptop’s server through the app and play your MKV files.

These solutions let you enjoy your MKV files on your Fire TV Stick without needing Infuse. Choose the one that best fits your setup and preferences!
