You're absolutely right — that global connectivity vs. domestic closed-loop is one of the most under-appreciated structural differences, and it deserves to be point #6 (or really point #1 in importance).

6. Manufacturing is globally arbitraged; real estate is not  
- Chinese factories compete against Vietnam, Mexico, Germany, the U.S., etc. Every single day. If a Shenzhen electronics factory or a Ningbo die-casting shop falls behind on price, quality, or delivery time, the overseas buyer simply routes the next PO (purchase order) elsewhere. This is brutal, real-time discipline from the entire planet.  
- Housing is almost 100 % a closed domestic market. A developer in Zhengzhou or Changsha isn’t competing with developers in Jakarta or Dallas. The only buyers are Chinese households (or speculators using Chinese savings). There is no global price arbitrage, no foreign buyer who says “this apartment is suddenly 30 % cheaper than an equivalent one in Bangkok, let’s load up 10,000 units.”  
→ Result: manufacturing overcapacity gets crushed instantly (zombie factories close in months), while housing overcapacity can linger for a decade or more because no external force is clearing the inventory.

This global vs. local distinction also explains three downstream effects we’re seeing right now (2024–2025):

a) Export share of manufacturing output keeps rising  
Even though global demand is uneven, China’s manufacturing export share has climbed from ~23 % of total industrial output pre-pandemic to over 30 % in 2024–2025 in many sectors (machinery, EVs, electronics, etc.). When domestic investment slows, factories simply redirect more output overseas. Real estate has no such escape valve.

b) Currency and trade surplus act as shock absorbers for manufacturing  
The huge trade surplus (approaching $1 trillion annualized in mid-2025) gives policymakers room to let the RMB depreciate gradually, which makes exports even more competitive and keeps factories busy. Real estate developers get no such help — a weaker RMB actually raises the burden of their (often USD-denominated) debt.

c) Local governments are structurally locked in  
Because land sales were 30–50 % of many local government revenues for years, they have strong incentives to delay the price discovery process (restrict second-hand sales, pressure banks to roll over developer loans, finish ghost projects with fiscal money, etc.). In manufacturing, local officials have almost zero ability to “rescue” an uncompetitive factory that is losing export orders.

So yes — the combination of  
(1) fast global feedback +  
(2) ability to pivot markets/products +  
(3) no local-government lifeline for failing firms  

…makes manufacturing self-correcting and antifragile, while real estate is slow, local, and politically protected until the imbalance becomes too large to hide.

If you want to go deeper on any of these threads, just say the word:

- How specific industrial clusters (e.g. Shenzhen–Dongguan for electronics, Yiwu–Ningbo for light industry, Changsha for construction machinery) amplify the global-arbitrage effect  
- Why EVs/solar/batteries were the perfect storm of manufacturing advantages (open global market + huge scale + tolerable domestic overcapacity)  
- What the endgame for the property sector looks like once inventory finally starts clearing (2027–2032 timeline scenarios)  
- Early signals that the bottom is forming (transaction volumes, land sale trends, etc.)

Your pick.
