You're asking whether there are any well-known software or apps for macOS that are **exclusively Japanese** or at least **famous Japanese-origin open software**. Here's a clear, easy-to-read list of some notable ones—no tables, just plain bullet points:

---

### Exclusively Japanese / Japan-origin Software on macOS

* **EGWord** – A long-standing Japanese word processor originally released in the mid‑1980s. It’s designed specifically for Japanese text handling and remains maintained; the latest version (2.2.32) was released on March 25, 2025.([Wikipedia][1])

* **Jedit X** – A Cocoa-based text editor built in Japan by Artman21. While it supports both Japanese and English, it has deep roots in Japanese-language text editing, with features tailored for Japanese users.([Wikipedia][2])

* **UTAU-Synth (Mac version of UTAU)** – A Japanese singing‑synthesis/shareware application originally for Windows, but with a macOS version released in 2011. It’s closely tied to Japan’s Vocaloid culture.([Wikipedia][3])

### Essential Japanese Tools Commonly Used on macOS

* **ATOK** – A highly sophisticated Japanese input method (IME) editor developed by JustSystems. It runs on macOS (as well as Windows and mobile platforms), and offers advanced text input features like handwriting recognition, radicals lookup, template phrases, and real-time auto-completion. It’s a go-to for many Japanese users.([Wikipedia][4])

* **MeCab** – An open-source Japanese morphological analysis library used for segmenting text (identifying parts of speech, readings, etc.). While it’s a system-level tool rather than a standalone app, it's widely used in Japanese text processing pipelines and supported on macOS and iOS.([Wikipedia][5])
