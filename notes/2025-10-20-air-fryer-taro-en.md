My apologies for the mix-up! You're referring to **芋头** (yùtóu in Mandarin), which is **taro root**, a starchy, small, round tuber similar in size and shape to a small potato, often used in Chinese and other Asian cuisines. Taro has a nutty, mildly sweet flavor and a creamy texture when cooked. Here's how to cook taro (yùtóu) in an air fryer to get a crispy exterior and tender interior, perfect as a snack or side dish. This recipe serves 2–4 and takes about 20–25 minutes.

### Ingredients
- 1 lb (450g) small taro roots (yùtóu), peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks or rounds (like small potato pieces)
- 1–2 tbsp neutral oil (e.g., vegetable, avocado, or sesame oil)
- Seasonings: ½ tsp salt, ¼ tsp black pepper, optional pinch of five-spice powder or garlic powder
- Optional: Soy sauce, chili oil, or hoisin sauce for dipping

### Instructions
1. **Prep the Taro**:
   - Peel the taro carefully (wear gloves if sensitive to its slightly slimy skin, as raw taro can irritate).
   - Cut into bite-sized, uniform 1-inch chunks or rounds for even cooking.
   - Rinse under cold water to remove excess starch, then pat dry thoroughly with paper towels (dry taro crisps better).

2. **Preheat Air Fryer**: Set your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) and preheat for 3–5 minutes (most models heat quickly).

3. **Season and Oil**: In a bowl, toss taro pieces with 1–2 tbsp oil to coat lightly. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and optional five-spice or garlic powder for flavor. Mix well to distribute seasonings.

4. **Arrange in Basket**: Place taro pieces in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding to ensure crispiness—cook in batches if needed (a 5–6 qt air fryer fits about 2 cups of chunks at a time).

5. **Air Fry**:
   - Cook at 400°F (200°C) for 12–15 minutes.
   - Shake the basket or flip pieces halfway through (at 6–8 minutes) for even browning.
   - Check doneness: Taro should be golden and crispy outside, fork-tender inside. If not soft enough, add 2–3 minutes. (Larger pieces may need up to 18 minutes total.)

6. **Rest and Serve**: Let taro cool for 1–2 minutes on a plate or rack to crisp further. Serve hot as a snack, side, or with dipping sauces like soy-chili or hoisin.

### Tips for Success
- **Size Matters**: Uniform 1-inch pieces cook evenly; too small burns, too large stays raw inside.
- **Frozen Taro**: If using frozen, add 3–5 minutes to cooking time; no need to thaw fully, but pat dry.
- **Flavor Variations**: Try tossing with a touch of honey and sesame seeds post-cooking for a sweet-savory twist, or sprinkle with chili powder for heat.
- **Safety Note**: Raw taro is toxic—always cook thoroughly until soft. Aim for an internal temp of at least 165°F (74°C) if checking.
- **Nutrition**: Air-fried taro is lighter than deep-fried (about 120–150 calories per 1-cup serving, depending on oil used) and retains its fiber and potassium.
- **Avoid**: Over-oiling (leads to sogginess) or skipping the dry pat (causes steaming).

This method draws from air fryer techniques for starchy vegetables like potatoes or taro, ensuring a crispy, healthier alternative to deep-frying. Enjoy your crispy air-fried yùtóu! Let me know if you want tips for a specific dipping sauce or another taro dish.
