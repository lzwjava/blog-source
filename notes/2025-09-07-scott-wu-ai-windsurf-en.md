### Key Highlights from the Interview

\*\* AI software engineer “Devin” and the “Moneyball-ification” of everything\*\*
Scott Wu describes how Cognition’s AI coding assistant, Devin, shapes how engineering is done—driving productivity and evolving toward a metrics-driven, “Moneyball-ified” approach. ([Irish Podcasts][1], [Podwise][2])

\*\* Early background and math competitions\*\*
Wu shares anecdotes from his youth—competing alongside peers like Alexandr Wang in math contests during 6th grade—and his early experiences working at Addepar while still in high school. ([Irish Podcasts][1], [Podwise][2])

\*\* Acquisition of Windsurf\*\*
A major focus: Cognition’s fast-moving acquisition of the AI tool startup *Windsurf* in July. Wu recounts a “sleepless weekend”—when OpenAI’s deal fell apart, Google reportedly swooped in to hire Windsurf’s CEO and license parts of its tech, prompting Cognition to move immediately. The goal was to preserve key talent and integrate infrastructure, marketing, and operations teams as swiftly as possible—within a few days—so they didn’t scatter elsewhere. ([Business Insider][3], [Irish Podcasts][1])

Wu noted that Windsurf brought complementary customer bases (e.g. JPMorgan), while Cognition had clients like Goldman Sachs—creating post-acquisition synergies. A major update called “Wave 11” was also rolled out shortly thereafter. ([Business Insider][3])

\*\* Broader implications: AI agent economy and AGI beliefs\*\*
They dig into wider themes: how agent-based AI systems are reshaping market structure and engineering workflows, and Wu’s assertion that “we already have AGI,” a provocative statement about current AI capabilities. ([Irish Podcasts][1], [Podwise][2])
