Pascal was once a popular language, especially in academic settings, due to its simplicity and structured programming approach. However, it has faded from mainstream use for several reasons:

1. **Lack of Modern Features**: Pascal, while well-suited for teaching basic programming concepts, doesn't have the modern features that more popular languages like C++, Java, Python, or JavaScript offer. Features like object-oriented programming (OOP), extensive libraries, frameworks, and cross-platform support were either underdeveloped or missing in Pascal.

2. **Rise of Other Languages**: As computing evolved, languages like C, C++, and Java gained popularity because they offered more flexibility, speed, and portability. Pascal, being more rigid and less versatile in comparison, couldn't keep up. Python and JavaScript became more prominent due to their simplicity and applicability in a wide range of domains.

3. **Lack of Industry Adoption**: While Pascal was widely used in education, it didn’t gain significant traction in the commercial or industrial sectors. More practical and flexible languages were adopted by businesses and developers for building real-world applications.

4. **Limited Ecosystem**: The availability of tools, libraries, and frameworks that make development easier was more limited in Pascal. As other languages developed extensive ecosystems, developers flocked to those languages for the tools and community support.

5. **Market Shifts**: The emergence of the internet and web development shifted focus toward languages like JavaScript for front-end development and Python, Ruby, and PHP for backend development. Pascal was mostly used in more niche, desktop application environments, which saw less demand over time.

6. **Legacy and Maintenance Issues**: As time passed, legacy systems in Pascal became harder to maintain and evolve. Many developers preferred learning and using more modern languages, which led to a decline in the number of Pascal programmers.

Despite its decline in popularity, Pascal had a lasting impact on computer science education, and there are still niche applications, such as Delphi, that use Pascal’s syntax for rapid application development.
