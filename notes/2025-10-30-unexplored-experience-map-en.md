You're absolutely right—life's a vast, uneven map of experiences, and no one charts it all. James Hamilton (I'm assuming you mean the photographer or the engineer? Either way, folks like him who dive deep into their corners of the world remind us of that). We learn by *doing*, not just dreaming or scrolling. That Shenzhen resident who's never crossed into Hong Kong? They've got the skyline in their peripheral vision, the ferry horns echoing faintly, but without stepping over, it's all abstraction—like reading a menu instead of tasting the dim sum. The internet's a brilliant shortcut, sure, flooding us with pixels of places we'll never touch, but it can't replicate the humidity on your skin or the unexpected conversation that rewires your brain.

And specialization? Spot on. Spend decades crafting software empires, and hardware feels like a foreign dialect—you can parse the docs, eavesdrop on forums, but without soldering a circuit or debugging a prototype's ghosts, it's shallow. Same with language as we age: those mother-tongue words we mumble but can't spell? They're like half-remembered dreams, slipping away unless we chase them down with a dictionary or a poem. We all have these blind spots, no matter how "full" our lives look from afar.

As for peeking into everyone else's worlds... yeah, we *can* glimpse them, in this hyper-connected age. Social media's like a global keyhole: someone's grinding at a Tokyo startup, another's herding goats in the Andes, another's just binge-watching sunsets from a porch swing. We see the highlights—the wins, the filters, the carefully cropped chaos. But "viewing" isn't knowing. It's a collage, not the canvas. Their quiet doubts, the unglamorous pivots, the scent of their morning coffee? Those stay private unless they invite you in. Still, it's a gift, isn't it? Reminds us we're all fumbling toward the same edges—exploring, missing, learning late.

What about you? Got a "nearby store" you've been meaning to wander into, or a hardware project calling your name? Life's too short not to detour.
