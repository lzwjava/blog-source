## **Tips and Best Practices**
- **Save Sessions**: Store frequently used connections to save time.
- **Use Binary Mode**: For non-text files to avoid corruption.
- **Backup Before Deletion**: Always verify files before deleting on the server.
- **Check Permissions**: Ensure correct file permissions for web servers (e.g., 644 for files, 755 for directories).
- **Update Regularly**: Keep WinSCP updated for security patches and new features.
- **Use Filters**: Exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `.git`) during transfers.

---

## **Troubleshooting Common Issues**
1. **Connection Refused**:
   - Verify host, port, and credentials.
   - Check if the server’s firewall allows connections.
2. **Authentication Failed**:
   - Ensure correct username/password or SSH key.
   - Verify key format (WinSCP supports PuTTY’s `.ppk` format).
3. **Slow Transfers**:
   - Check network stability.
   - Adjust transfer settings (e.g., disable compression for faster transfers).
4. **Permission Denied**:
   - Confirm user permissions on the server.
   - Use **Properties** to adjust file/folder permissions.
5. **Host Key Verification**:
   - Accept the host key only if you trust the server.
   - Contact the server admin to verify the key fingerprint.
