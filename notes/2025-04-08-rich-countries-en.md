1. Luxembourg
2. Singapore

2. High human capital - Significant investments in education and healthcare
3. Economic diversification or specialized niches - Either diverse economies or strong focus in high-value sectors
4. Open trade policies - Most are highly engaged in international trade
5. Developed financial systems - Sophisticated banking and investment infrastructure
6. Natural resource wealth (for some) - Countries like Qatar, Norway, and UAE benefit from oil/gas reserves
7. Geographic advantages - Many have strategic locations for trade or connectivity
8. Small to medium population size - Several of the wealthiest countries have relatively small populations
9. Innovation and technology focus - Many invest heavily in R&D and technological advancement
