Yes, the Apple 35W Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter (designed for the MacBook Air M2) can charge an iPhone 14 Pro Max using one of its two USB-C ports. 

Since the iPhone 14 Pro Max uses a Lightning port, you'll need a USB-C to Lightning cable (Apple's official one or a certified third-party option) to connect it. The adapter supports USB Power Delivery and is explicitly compatible with iPhones for charging.

When using both ports simultaneously, power is split (up to 35W total), but a single port can deliver the full 35W if only one device is connected—more than enough for fast charging the iPhone (which maxes out at around 20-27W).
