### Prerequisites
- Ensure your Bluetooth 5.3 emitter (dongle) is plugged into the USB 3.0 port and recognized by Ubuntu. Run `lsusb` in the terminal to check if it shows up (look for something like "Bluetooth" or the vendor ID). If not, try a different USB port or reboot.
- Install Bluetooth tools if not already present:  
  ```
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install bluez bluetooth bluez-tools
  ```
- Unblock Bluetooth if needed:  
  ```
  rfkill unblock bluetooth
  ```
- Restart the Bluetooth service:  
  ```
  sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
  ```

### Pairing Steps Using bluetoothctl (Recommended for CLI)
The `bluetoothctl` tool is the standard way to manage Bluetooth in Linux/Ubuntu. Logitech keyboards (like MX Keys, K380, or similar) often require entering a pairing PIN on the keyboard itself.

1. **Open the Bluetooth console**:  
   ```
   bluetoothctl
   ```
   This enters an interactive shell (prompt changes to `[bluetooth]#`).

2. **Enable the adapter**:  
   ```
   power on
   ```
   (If it says "No default controller available," run `list` to see your adapter and `select <adapter_MAC>` if multiple.)

3. **Set up the pairing agent**:  
   ```
   agent on
   default-agent
   ```
   This enables PIN handling and makes your session the default for pairing.

4. **Start scanning for devices**:  
   ```
   scan on
   ```
   Keep this running. Your Logitech keyboard should appear after ~10-20 seconds (e.g., as "Logitech K380" or similar, with a MAC address like `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`).

5. **Put your Logitech keyboard in pairing mode**:  
   - Turn it on (if it has a power switch).  
   - Press and hold the Bluetooth pairing button (usually on the side or top—check your model; for multi-device models like MX Keys, hold the channel button 1/2/3 for 3-5 seconds until the LED blinks rapidly).  
   - If it's a single-device model, hold the main pairing button.

6. **Pair the device**:  
   Once it shows in the scan (press Enter to refresh), run:  
   ```
   pair <MAC_ADDRESS>
   ```
   - Example: `pair 12:34:56:78:9A:BC`  
   - Ubuntu will prompt for a PIN (often 0000 or 1234 for Logitech—try defaults first).  
   - **Key step for Logitech**: Type the PIN directly on the *physical keyboard* and press Enter. (If no GUI notifications appear, this is crucial—some users report needing to enable system notifications via `gnome-control-center` > Notifications, but CLI often bypasses this.)

7. **Trust and connect**:  
   ```
   trust <MAC_ADDRESS>
   connect <MAC_ADDRESS>
   ```
   - This auto-connects on future use.

8. **Exit the console**:  
   ```
   exit
   ```

### Troubleshooting
- **Device not scanning**: Ensure the keyboard is in pairing mode (blinking LED). Run `scan off` then `scan on` again. Wait up to 30 seconds.
- **Pairing fails (e.g., "AuthenticationCanceled")**: Remove the device first (`remove <MAC>`), then retry. For stubborn Logitech models, try holding the pairing button longer or toggling channels.
- **No PIN prompt**: Some keyboards pair without one—proceed to connect. If stuck, check logs: `sudo journalctl -u bluetooth -f` while pairing.
- **Adapter issues**: If using a USB Bluetooth 5.3 dongle, confirm kernel support (Ubuntu 22.04+ handles BT 5.3 well). Update kernel if on older Ubuntu: `sudo apt install linux-generic-hwe-22.04`.
- **GUI alternative**: Open Settings > Bluetooth, toggle on, and pair from there—but CLI is more reliable for Logitech quirks.
- Test: After pairing, type in a terminal. If it works, add to startup auto-connect via `bluetoothctl` or crontab.

If your specific Logitech model (e.g., MX Keys Mini) has unique issues, provide the exact model for tailored steps.
