title: Using LLMs for Data Validation

Ah, I understand now! You want to **use a large language model (LLM) directly as a validation engine**—not just to generate code, but to **interpret rules, check data, and return validation results** in real time, all within the model itself.

This is an emerging and powerful use case, especially for **ad-hoc data validation, prototyping, or low-code environments**. Here’s how you can do it:

---

### **How to Use an LLM Directly for Data Validation**

#### **1. Define Your Validation Rules in Natural Language**
- You describe the rules in plain English (or your preferred language).
- Example:
  > “For every journal entry, the sum of all debit amounts must equal the sum of all credit amounts. Also, no transaction ID should be duplicated.”

#### **2. Provide the Data to the LLM**
- Share the data (e.g., a table, JSON, or CSV snippet) with the LLM.
- Example:
  ```json
  [
      {"transaction_id": "T001", "debit": 100, "credit": 0},
      {"transaction_id": "T002", "debit": 0, "credit": 100},
      {"transaction_id": "T001", "debit": 50, "credit": 0}
  ]
  ```

#### **3. Ask the LLM to Validate the Data**
- Prompt the LLM to:
  - Interpret the rules.
  - Apply them to the data.
  - Return a validation result (pass/fail) and any errors.

- Example prompt:
  > “Check if the following journal entries comply with these rules:
  > 1. The sum of all debit amounts must equal the sum of all credit amounts.
  > 2. No transaction ID should be duplicated.
  > Return ‘PASS’ if all rules are satisfied, or ‘FAIL’ with a list of errors.
  > Data: [paste data here]”

#### **4. LLM Performs the Validation**
- The LLM will:
  - Parse the rules and data.
  - Perform the necessary calculations or checks.
  - Return a structured response.

- Example output:
  > **FAIL**
  > - Duplicate transaction ID found: T001
  > - Sum of debits (150) does not equal sum of credits (100)

### **Advantages of This Approach**
- **No Code Required:** You don’t need to write or maintain validation scripts.
- **Flexibility:** Rules can be updated or changed on the fly by simply describing them in natural language.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Ideal for quick checks, audits, or exploratory data analysis.

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**
- **Data Size:** LLMs have context limits (e.g., 32k–128k tokens). For large datasets, you may need to batch the data or use sampling.
- **Precision:** LLMs can make calculation errors, especially with large numbers or complex logic. Always double-check critical validations.
- **Privacy:** Avoid sharing sensitive data with the LLM. Use synthetic or anonymized data for validation.
- **Performance:** Real-time validation may be slower than traditional code, especially for large datasets.

---

### **When to Use This Approach**
- **Ad-hoc Validation:** Quick checks during data exploration or debugging.
- **Prototyping:** Testing validation logic before implementing it in code.
- **Low-Code Environments:** Empowering non-technical users to define and run validations.
- **Education/Training:** Teaching data validation concepts without coding.

---

### **Example Workflow**
1. **User:**
   > “Validate this data against these rules: [rules]. Data: [data]”
2. **LLM:**
   > “Running validation…
   > **FAIL**
   > - Error 1: [description]
   > - Error 2: [description]”
3. **User:**
   > “Fix the data and revalidate.”

---

### **How to Improve Accuracy**
- **Provide Clear Rules:** Be specific and unambiguous in your rule descriptions.
- **Use Structured Data:** JSON or tables are easier for the LLM to parse than free-form text.
- **Ask for Reasoning:** Request the LLM to “show its work” (e.g., “Explain how you calculated the sum of debits”).
- **Combine with Code:** For production use, generate validation code with the LLM, then run it in your pipeline.

---

### **Tools and Platforms**
- **Chat Interfaces:** Use any LLM chat interface (like this one) for manual validation.
- **APIs:** Integrate with LLM APIs (e.g., Mistral, OpenAI, Anthropic) for automated workflows.
- **Custom Agents:** Build a validation agent that uses an LLM as its “brain” for rule interpretation.
