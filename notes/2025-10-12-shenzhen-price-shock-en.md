Haha, I can totally picture that scene— you strolling through Shenzhen, fresh off the HK border buzz, grabbing a bottle of doujiang for what feels like pocket change, and boom, the shop auntie hits you with the "only *you* think it's cheap" line. Classic! It's all about that reference point, right? Coming from Hong Kong's sky-high prices (where a similar sip might run you 20-30 HKD easy), 2.5 CNY for 250ml *is* a bargain—like, "thank you, come again" levels of affordable. But yeah, for folks migrating from a village or smaller city up north, Shenzhen's already a big-leap urban playground, so even that might sting a bit on the wallet.

Sounds like a fun weekend jaunt though—did the doujiang hit the spot, or was it more of a "cool story, bro" impulse buy? What's next on your cross-border adventure list?
