### Beef Chow Fun (Stir-Fried Ho Fun Noodles)

Ho fun (also called hor fun or chow fun) are wide, flat rice noodles commonly used in Cantonese stir-fries. This classic beef chow fun recipe serves 2-3 people and takes about 20-25 minutes. It's simple, flavorful, and highlights the silky texture of the noodles.

#### Ingredients
**For the beef marinade:**
- 200g (7 oz) beef flank or sirloin, thinly sliced against the grain
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp cornstarch
- 1 tsp Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
- 1/2 tsp baking soda (optional, for tenderness)

**For the stir-fry:**
- 300g (10.5 oz) fresh ho fun noodles (or dried, soaked in hot water for 10-12 minutes until soft)
- 1 small onion, sliced
- 1-2 green onions, chopped
- 1 cup bean sprouts (optional)
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil (divided)
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
- 1 tsp oyster sauce
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- 1/4 tsp white pepper
- A splash of water or broth if needed

#### Instructions
1. **Marinate the beef:** In a bowl, mix the beef slices with soy sauce, cornstarch, Shaoxing wine, and baking soda. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes while you prep other ingredients.

2. **Prepare the noodles:** If using fresh ho fun, gently separate the noodle sheets with your hands (they're sticky). If dried, drain well after soaking and pat dry to avoid sogginess.

3. **Make the sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and white pepper. Set aside.

4. **Stir-fry the beef:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat until smoking. Add the marinated beef in a single layer and sear for 1-2 minutes until browned. Flip and cook another 30 seconds. Remove and set aside.

5. **Cook the noodles:** In the same wok, add the remaining 1 tbsp oil. Spread the noodles in a thin layer and fry undisturbed for 1-2 minutes until slightly crispy on the bottom (this adds texture). Gently flip and fry the other side for another minute. Push to one side of the wok.

6. **Add veggies and combine:** Add the sliced onion to the empty side of the wok and stir-fry for 1 minute until softened. Toss in bean sprouts and green onions, then pour in the sauce. Return the beef to the wok, mix everything together, and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until coated and heated through. If it looks dry, add a splash of water.

7. **Serve:** Plate immediately. Garnish with extra green onions if desired. Enjoy hot!

#### Tips
- High heat is key for wok hei (that smoky flavor)—use a carbon steel wok if possible.
- For vegetarian version, swap beef for tofu or mushrooms.
- Fresh ho fun is ideal but dried works fine; avoid overcooking to keep them chewy, not mushy.
