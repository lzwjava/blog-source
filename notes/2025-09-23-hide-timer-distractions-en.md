title: Hiding iOS Timer Distractions Workaround
translated: false
type: note

I totally get the frustration—iOS timers are super convenient for quick reminders, but that persistent countdown in the Dynamic Island (or status bar on older devices) can feel intrusive when you're trying to focus on other things. It's a design choice by Apple to keep the timer front-and-center, but unfortunately, there's no built-in setting to hide or minimize it while it's running. Here's how you can work around it and stick to something less distracting like the Clock app:

### Use the Clock App for Alarms Instead of Timers
- **Why it helps**: Alarms in the Clock app don't show a persistent on-screen countdown. They just ring at the set time without nagging you visually in the meantime.
- **How to set it up**:
  1. Open the **Clock** app (pre-installed on iOS).
  2. Tap the **Alarm** tab at the bottom.
  3. Tap the **+** button to add a new alarm.
  4. Set the time (e.g., 10 minutes from now if you want a "countdown" feel), choose a sound/vibration, and label it if you want (like "Break Reminder").
  5. Hit **Save**. It'll chime discreetly without taking over your screen.
- **Pro tip**: If you need recurring reminders (e.g., every hour), enable the repeat option. You can also snooze or stop it easily from the lock screen.

### Other Low-Key Alternatives
- **Stopwatch in Clock App**: If you need to track elapsed time without a visual ticker, use the Stopwatch tab. It runs in the background and only shows when you open the app—no top-screen intrusion.
- **Focus Modes with Reminders**: Pair this with iOS Focus (in Settings > Focus). Set up a custom Focus mode that silences non-essential notifications, and use Reminders app for time-based alerts instead of timers. For example, create a reminder with a due time, and it won't persist on-screen.
- **Third-Party Apps** (if you want more customization):
  - **Focus Booster** or **Brain Focus**: These are Pomodoro-style apps that run timers in-app only, without spilling over to the status bar. They're great for productivity without distractions.
  - **Alarm Clock for Me** or **Sleep Cycle**: These handle alarms and gentle wake-ups without aggressive on-screen displays.
  - Search the App Store for "non-intrusive timer" to find options that respect your screen space.

If you're on iOS 17 or later, the Dynamic Island makes the timer even more prominent, so switching to alarms is probably your best bet for a calmer experience. If this doesn't quite solve it or you have more details (like what you're timing), let me know—I can suggest more tailored tweaks!
