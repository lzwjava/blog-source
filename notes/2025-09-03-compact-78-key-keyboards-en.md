If you're after a keyboard that’s easy to carry, compact like a 78‑key layout, here's how to choose wisely and some notable brands to consider:

---

### What’s special about 78-key keyboards?

* **Layout & Usability**
  A 78‑key keyboard typically fits into the *75% layout* family. It keeps essential keys—like the arrow keys and sometimes a minimal numpad—while trimming down unused space. It strikes a nice balance between compactness and full functionality ([REDRAGON ZONE][1]).

* **Portability**
  These keyboards are generally lightweight and slim, making them easy to transport. Some models bundle in a touchpad, eliminating the need for a separate mouse—particularly handy if you’re on the move ([Amazon][2], [Walmart.com][3]).

* **TaiHao** – They offer a “78 Key Mechanical Keyboard” that’s compact but retains the functionality of a standard tenkeyless board, plus LED lighting and durable double‑shot PBT keycaps ([Drop][5]).
