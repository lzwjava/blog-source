Let’s dive into how the given code snippet works, specifically the lines:

```python
hash_obj = hashlib.sha1(piece)
hashes.append(hash_obj.hexdigest())
return hashes
```

The user has asked us to explain this without using a library, so I’ll first explain what the code does with the `hashlib` library, then explore how the same functionality could be achieved without it.

---

### Understanding the Code with `hashlib`

This snippet computes a hash for a piece of data and stores it in a list. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what’s happening:

1. **`hash_obj = hashlib.sha1(piece)`**
   - **What it does**: This line uses Python’s `hashlib` module to create a SHA-1 hash object. SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input (here, `piece`) and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value.
   - **Input**: `piece` is a chunk of data, likely bytes, read from a file or another source.
   - **Process**: The `hashlib.sha1()` function initializes a hash object and immediately updates it with the data in `piece`. Think of it as feeding the data into a hashing machine that starts crunching numbers.

2. **`hashes.append(hash_obj.hexdigest())`**
   - **What it does**: The `hexdigest()` method retrieves the hash value computed by the hash object and converts it into a hexadecimal string (a human-readable format using digits 0-9 and letters a-f).
   - **Output**: For SHA-1, this string is 40 characters long because each of the 20 bytes is represented by two hexadecimal digits (e.g., a byte value of 255 becomes "ff").
   - **Storage**: The resulting string is appended to a list called `hashes`, which presumably collects hashes for multiple pieces of data.

3. **`return hashes`**
   - **What it does**: After processing all pieces (assuming this code is in a loop or function), the list `hashes` containing all the hexadecimal hash strings is returned.

**In summary**: For each `piece` of data, the code computes its SHA-1 hash using `hashlib.sha1()`, converts the hash to a hexadecimal string with `hexdigest()`, and stores it in the `hashes` list, which is then returned.

### Without Using a Library: Computing SHA-1 from Scratch

The user’s instruction “do not use lib” suggests they want to understand how this could work without relying on `hashlib`. Implementing SHA-1 from scratch is complex, but I’ll explain the process clearly and provide a simplified version you could build upon.

#### What is SHA-1?
SHA-1 is a hash function that:
- Takes any input data (e.g., `piece`).
- Produces a fixed 160-bit (20-byte) output.
- Uses a series of bitwise operations, rotations, and additions to transform the input.

Without `hashlib`, we’d need to replicate this algorithm ourselves. Here’s how it could work for the given code:

#### Step-by-Step SHA-1 Process

1. **Prepare the Input (Padding)**
   - SHA-1 processes data in 512-bit (64-byte) blocks. If `piece` isn’t exactly 64 bytes, we pad it:
     - Append a `1` bit (e.g., `0x80` in bytes).
     - Add enough `0` bits to make the length 448 bits (56 bytes) modulo 512.
     - Append the original length of `piece` (in bits) as a 64-bit integer.
   - For simplicity, if `piece` is smaller than 64 bytes, we can pad it to one block.

2. **Initialize Hash Values**
   - SHA-1 uses five 32-bit variables (160 bits total), initialized to specific constants:
     - `h0 = 0x67452301`
     - `h1 = 0xEFCDAB89`
     - `h2 = 0x98BADCFE`
     - `h3 = 0x10325476`
     - `h4 = 0xC3D2E1F0`

3. **Process the Data Block**
   - Split the 64-byte block into 16 32-bit words (4 bytes each).
   - Expand these into 80 words using the formula:
     ```python
     w[i] = left_rotate(w[i-3] ^ w[i-8] ^ w[i-14] ^ w[i-16], 1)  # for i = 16 to 79
     ```
     where `left_rotate` shifts bits left and wraps them around.
   - For 80 rounds, update temporary variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e` (starting as copies of `h0` to `h4`):
     - Use different functions and constants based on the round number (0-19, 20-39, etc.).
     - Example for rounds 0-19:
       ```python
       f = (b & c) | (~b & d)
       k = 0x5A827999
       temp = (left_rotate(a, 5) + f + e + k + w[i]) & 0xFFFFFFFF
       ```
     - Shift variables: `e = d`, `d = c`, `c = left_rotate(b, 30)`, `b = a`, `a = temp`.

4. **Update Hash Values**
   - After 80 rounds, add the results to the initial hash values:
     ```python
     h0 = (h0 + a) & 0xFFFFFFFF
     h1 = (h1 + b) & 0xFFFFFFFF
     # ...and so on for h2, h3, h4
     ```

5. **Produce the Hexadecimal Output**
   - Concatenate `h0` to `h4` as a 160-bit value and convert to a 40-character hexadecimal string.

#### Simplified Python Implementation

Here’s a basic version of how you might rewrite the code without `hashlib`:

```python
def left_rotate(value, shift):
    """Rotate a 32-bit integer left by 'shift' bits."""
    return ((value << shift) | (value >> (32 - shift))) & 0xFFFFFFFF

def custom_sha1(piece):
    """Compute SHA-1 hash of 'piece' and return it as a hex string."""
    # For simplicity, assume piece is less than 56 bytes and pad to one block
    message = piece + b'\x80' + (b'\x00' * (55 - len(piece))) + (len(piece) * 8).to_bytes(8, 'big')
    
    # Initialize hash values
    h0, h1, h2, h3, h4 = (
        0x67452301, 0xEFCDAB89, 0x98BADCFE, 0x10325476, 0xC3D2E1F0
    )
    
    # Split into 16 32-bit words
    w = [int.from_bytes(message[i:i+4], 'big') for i in range(0, 64, 4)]
    
    # Expand to 80 words
    for i in range(16, 80):
        w.append(left_rotate(w[i-3] ^ w[i-8] ^ w[i-14] ^ w[i-16], 1))
    
    # Initialize working variables
    a, b, c, d, e = h0, h1, h2, h3, h4
    
    # 80 rounds of processing
    for i in range(80):
        if 0 <= i < 20:
            f = (b & c) | (~b & d)
            k = 0x5A827999
        elif 20 <= i < 40:
            f = b ^ c ^ d
            k = 0x6ED9EBA1
        elif 40 <= i < 60:
            f = (b & c) | (b & d) | (c & d)
            k = 0x8F1BBCDC
        else:
            f = b ^ c ^ d
            k = 0xCA62C1D6
        
        temp = (left_rotate(a, 5) + f + e + k + w[i]) & 0xFFFFFFFF
        e = d
        d = c
        c = left_rotate(b, 30)
        b = a
        a = temp
    
    # Update hash values
    h0 = (h0 + a) & 0xFFFFFFFF
    h1 = (h1 + b) & 0xFFFFFFFF
    h2 = (h2 + c) & 0xFFFFFFFF
    h3 = (h3 + d) & 0xFFFFFFFF
    h4 = (h4 + e) & 0xFFFFFFFF
    
    # Return as 40-character hex string
    return f"{h0:08x}{h1:08x}{h2:08x}{h3:08x}{h4:08x}"

# Rewritten code without hashlib
def compute_hashes(pieces):
    hashes = []
    for piece in pieces:  # Assuming pieces is a list of byte chunks
        hash_value = custom_sha1(piece)
        hashes.append(hash_value)
    return hashes

# Example usage
pieces = [b"hello", b"world"]
hashes = compute_hashes(pieces)
print(hashes)
```

#### How It Matches the Original
- **`hash_obj = hashlib.sha1(piece)`**: Replaced by `custom_sha1(piece)`, which computes the SHA-1 hash manually.
- **`hashes.append(hash_obj.hexdigest())`**: The `custom_sha1` function returns the hex string directly, so we append it to `hashes`.
- **`return hashes`**: Remains the same, returning the list of hash strings.

---

### Key Differences and Caveats
- **Simplification**: This implementation assumes each `piece` fits in one 512-bit block (less than 56 bytes due to padding). A full SHA-1 implementation would handle multiple blocks.
- **Performance**: A manual implementation is slower and less optimized than `hashlib`.
- **Reliability**: Libraries like `hashlib` are tested and secure; a custom version might have bugs unless thoroughly validated.

In essence, the original code uses `hashlib` as a shortcut to compute SHA-1 hashes efficiently, while doing it without a library requires manually coding the entire SHA-1 algorithm, handling padding, and converting the result to hexadecimal format. The logic remains the same: process each piece, compute its hash, store it, and return the collection.
