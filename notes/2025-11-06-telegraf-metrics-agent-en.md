Telegraf is an open-source, plugin-driven agent developed by InfluxData for collecting, processing, aggregating, and writing metrics, logs, and other telemetry data from various sources. It's lightweight, runs as a single binary, and supports over 300 input plugins (e.g., for system stats, databases like MySQL/PostgreSQL, cloud services like AWS, and apps like Apache Kafka) and 50+ output plugins (e.g., to InfluxDB, Prometheus, Kafka, or Elasticsearch).

### Key Features
- **Agent-based architecture**: Deploys easily on servers, containers, or IoT devices without heavy dependencies.
- **Extensible via plugins**: Written in Go, allowing custom plugins if needed.
- **Part of the TICK stack**: Integrates seamlessly with InfluxDB for time-series data storage, Chronograf for visualization, and Kapacitor for alerting.
- **Use cases**: Common in DevOps for infrastructure monitoring, application performance tracking, and IoT sensor data ingestion.

It's free under the MIT license and actively maintained, with the latest stable release as of late 2025 being v1.29.x.
