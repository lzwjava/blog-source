## Quick Summary

To reverse myopia, you only need to do this:

1. **Get glasses that are 100 degrees weaker than your actual prescription.** The visual effect will be like having 100 degrees of myopia, which barely affects daily life. Wear these glasses normally and live your life as usual - no special exercises needed.

2. **After a few months, your vision will improve and your degree will decrease.** When it decreases by about 50 degrees, get new lenses that maintain the 100-degree gap below your actual prescription. Repeat this cycle until vision recovers to 20/20.

## The Secret of External Eye Muscles

The cause of myopia stems from the external eye muscles. The eyeball has 6 precise muscles (4 rectus muscles, 2 oblique muscles). While most people think these muscles only rotate the eyeball, Dr. W.H. Bates discovered 100 years ago through animal experiments that these muscles can also change the eyeball's shape for precise focusing.

The two oblique muscles wrap around the eyeball's sides and can create lateral pressure, squeezing the eyeball longer. The four rectus muscles pulling backward together can make the eyeball shorter. Under the interaction of these 6 muscles, the eyeball constantly changes shape.

## How Myopia Develops

When looking at close objects, if the eyeball is completely relaxed, the image falls behind the retina. To see clearly, the lens needs to be compressed to increase refraction. Simultaneously, external muscles may slightly elongate the eyeball so the image falls exactly on the retina.

Looking at close objects too long keeps the eyeball in an elongated state. Maintaining this shape long-term makes the eye axis longer, preventing it from returning to normal when looking far, causing myopia.

**The root cause of myopia is prolonged, tense viewing of close objects** (books, phones, computers), not light or genetics. Myopia is actually a feature, not a bug - it's the eye adapting to make close viewing easier.

## The "Non-Myopic Gene" Myth

People who claim to have "good genes" and never become myopic despite eye abuse actually have a special way of using their eyes. Though they seem to be looking close, their eyes are in a relaxed "looking but not looking" state, not actually focusing on near objects but somewhere behind the screen. This is called "Central Fixation" in Bates' work.

This "non-myopic gene" may not be physiological inheritance but psychological and habitual "inheritance" from parents' lifestyle and education.

## Relationship Between Myopia Degree and "Clear Range"

Without glasses, myopia rarely exceeds 300 degrees, usually stabilizing around 200 degrees. This is because a 200-degree myopic eye, when completely relaxed, can see objects clearly at 0.5m distance. The formula is:

**100 / Myopia Degree = Maximum Clear Distance (in meters)**

For example:
- 200-degree myopia: clear range = 0.5m
- 300-degree myopia: clear range = 0.33m

## How to Prevent Myopia Progression

High myopia usually develops from wearing full-prescription glasses when viewing close objects. The myopic eye naturally sees close objects more easily, but full-prescription glasses cancel this advantage, forcing continued eye strain and axis elongation.

**For existing myopia, glasses should be at least 25 degrees under full correction.**

## Myopia Reversal Principle

Natural myopia reversal depends on "looking far" (in quotes because "far" is relative to your current vision).

For someone with 20/20 vision, "far" means 6+ meters. For 100-degree myopia, "far" means 1+ meters. For 500-degree myopia, "far" means 0.2+ meters.

When looking far, if the image still falls in front of the retina after lens relaxation, external muscles will gently compress the eyeball to shorten the axis slightly. Regular exposure to this blurry state causes repeated small compressions, permanently shortening the eye axis and reversing myopia.

## Specific Reversal Methods

### Method 1: No Glasses
Complete removal of glasses. An 18-year-old with 600+ degree myopia reduced it by ~100 degrees in 3 months using this method.

### Method 2: Reduced Prescription Glasses (Recommended)
- If you have 600-degree myopia, get 500-degree glasses
- This creates the visual effect of 100-degree myopia
- Everything beyond 1m becomes "far viewing" that helps reverse myopia
- After a few months, when vision improves by ~50 degrees, get new glasses maintaining the 100-degree gap

### Method 3: Multiple Glasses for Different Distances
- Daily glasses: 100 degrees under prescription
- Computer glasses: 150 degrees under prescription
- Place screen at 0.66m+ for slight blur while computing

## Additional Considerations

### Screen Settings
- Don't make fonts too large - larger fonts create larger visual angles, equivalent to viewing closer objects
- Use normal or slightly smaller fonts to simulate viewing farther objects

### Eye Balance
- If eyes differ by more than 50 degrees, get glasses to balance vision between eyes
- The brain preferentially uses the better eye's image

### Safety Warnings
- Progress is slow - expect 25 degrees improvement in 3 months
- Don't strain or force clear vision
- People over 40 should be especially careful due to vitreous aging
- Stop immediately if experiencing pain, double vision, or floaters

### High Myopia (800+ degrees)
Get eye examination first to check for retinal issues before attempting this method.

### Low Myopia (Under 100 degrees)
Use reading glasses to create artificial myopia:
- 100-degree myopia + 50-degree reading glasses = 150-degree myopia effect
- Gradually increase reading glass strength as myopia decreases

## Progress Monitoring

Choose a reference object with text at a consistent distance from your usual sitting position. Monitor clarity changes over time rather than frequent measurements to avoid disappointment from slow progress.

Use the formula: **Myopia Degree = 100/Clear Distance** to estimate improvement.

## Safety First: Natural Approach

This method emphasizes natural eye use without forced exercises. Avoid methods requiring:
- Strenuous focusing exercises
- Suppressing blinking
- Ignoring pain signals
- "Active focus" drills

**Warning signs to stop immediately:**
- Eye socket, temple, or eyeball pain
- Blurred vision
- Double vision  
- Slower focusing speed
- Floaters

The key is patience and natural progression. Your myopia took years to develop, so reversal will also take time.
