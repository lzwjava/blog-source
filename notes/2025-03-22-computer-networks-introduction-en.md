### Main Points of "Introduction to Computer Networks"
The introductory chapter typically lays the foundation for understanding computer networks. Here are the essential concepts to master:

1. **Definition and Purpose**  
   - A computer network is a set of interconnected devices (computers, phones, etc.) that share resources and exchange data.  
   - Purpose: Enable communication, resource sharing (e.g., printers), and data access (e.g., internet).

2. **Network Classifications**  
   - **By Scale**:  
     - LAN (Local Area Network): Small area (e.g., office, home).  
     - WAN (Wide Area Network): Large area (e.g., internet).  
     - MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): City-wide.  
     - PAN (Personal Area Network): Personal devices (e.g., Bluetooth).  
   - **By Connection**: Wired (e.g., Ethernet) vs. Wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi).

3. **Network Topologies**  
   - Physical or logical arrangement of devices:  
     - **Star**: Central hub, easy to manage, fails if hub fails.  
     - **Bus**: Single cable, simple but prone to collision.  
     - **Ring**: Circular data flow, each device connected to next.  
     - **Mesh**: Every device connected, reliable but complex.

4. **Basic Components**  
   - **Nodes/Devices**: Computers, routers, switches, etc.  
   - **Transmission Media**: Cables (twisted pair, fiber), wireless (radio waves).  
   - **Protocols**: Rules for communication (e.g., TCP/IP).

5. **Network Applications**  
   - Examples: Web browsing (HTTP), email (SMTP), file sharing (FTP).  
   - Importance: Drives modern communication and business.

### Learning Materials
Here are recommended resources to study the "Introduction to Computer Networks" chapter:

1. **Textbooks**  
   - *Computer Networks* by Andrew S. Tanenbaum (Chinese edition available in libraries or bookstores like Dangdang).  
     - Focus: Chapter 1 covers basics like definitions, topologies, and types.  
   - *Data Communications and Networking* by Behrouz A. Forouzan (widely used in China).  
     - Focus: Early chapters on network models and intro concepts.  

2. **Self-Study Exam Guides**  
   - Look for Guangdong-specific 自考教材 (self-study textbooks) for course 02141, published by Higher Education Press or Peking University Press.  
     - Available at local bookstores or online (e.g., JD.com, Taobao).  
   - Check for "Computer Networks Technology" guides with past questions.

3. **Online Resources**  
   - **Khan Academy**: Free networking basics (search "Introduction to Networks").  
   - **YouTube**: Channels like "PowerCert Animated Videos" or "CrashCourse Computer Science" (English, but clear visuals). Search "计算机网络入门" for Chinese videos.  
   - **Cisco Networking Academy**: Free intro modules (cisco.com, search "Networking Essentials").  

4. **Notes and Summaries**  
   - Create a cheat sheet with definitions, topology diagrams, and examples (e.g., LAN in a school, WAN as the internet).  
   - Use flashcards for terms like "protocol," "topology," and "LAN/WAN."

### Example Quiz Questions
Here’s a sample quiz to test your understanding, with answers provided:

#### Multiple Choice
1. **What is the primary purpose of a computer network?**  
   a) To store data locally  
   b) To connect devices for resource sharing and communication  
   c) To increase device speed  
   d) To replace hardware  
   - *Answer*: b) To connect devices for resource sharing and communication  

2. **Which network type covers a small geographic area like an office?**  
   a) WAN  
   b) LAN  
   c) MAN  
   d) PAN  
   - *Answer*: b) LAN  

3. **In a star topology, what happens if the central hub fails?**  
   a) Network continues normally  
   b) Only one device loses connection  
   c) Entire network fails  
   d) Data reroutes automatically  
   - *Answer*: c) Entire network fails  

#### True/False
4. **A bus topology uses a single shared cable for all devices.**  
   - *Answer*: True  

5. **WAN stands for Wireless Area Network.**  
   - *Answer*: False (Wide Area Network)  

#### Short Answer
6. **Name two examples of network applications.**  
   - *Answer*: Web browsing (HTTP), email (SMTP)  

7. **List two advantages of a mesh topology.**  
   - *Answer*: High reliability (multiple paths), fault tolerance (if one link fails, others work).

### Study Tips Before the Exam
1. **Focus on Key Concepts**  
   - Memorize definitions (e.g., LAN vs. WAN) and topology pros/cons.  
   - Draw topology diagrams (star, bus, etc.) to visualize connections.

2. **Practice Questions**  
   - Use past self-study exam papers (check Guangdong exam office or online forums like Baidu Tieba).  
   - Time yourself: 5-10 minutes per set of 10 questions.

3. **Understand, Don’t Just Memorize**  
   - Example: Why is star topology common? (Easy to add devices, centralized control.)  
   - Relate to real life: Your home Wi-Fi is a LAN!

4. **Review Protocols Briefly**  
   - Know that protocols (e.g., TCP/IP) are rules—details come later in the course, but the intro might mention them.

5. **Rest and Revise**  
   - Study 1-2 hours daily on this chapter, then review notes the day before the exam.  
   - Sleep well—self-study exams like 02141 often test clear thinking.
