### What This Lesson Shows

Your experience highlights a few classic pitfalls in air fryer cooking, especially with sliced potatoes:

- **Uneven thickness is the biggest culprit**: You mentioned "slice but not piece, some little thick" (I'm assuming this means some slices were thicker than others). Thicker slices retain more moisture and take longer to crisp up, while thinner ones cook faster. At 180°C for 20 minutes, the thin ones might have started crisping, but the thick ones stayed hard and underdone (raw-ish inside). Then, blasting them at 200°C for another 10 minutes overcooked the thinner slices to burnt while the thicker ones still weren't perfect.

- **Temperature spikes can lead to burning**: Air fryers cook hot and fast with circulating air, so jumping from 180°C to 200°C without adjusting time (or removing done slices) turns edges black quickly. Potatoes have natural sugars that caramelize and burn easily above 190°C if overexposed.

- **No mid-cook checks or adjustments**: Without shaking the basket or flipping halfway, hot spots can cause uneven cooking. Also, potatoes need a bit of oil to crisp (starch alone can make them dry/hard).

In short: It's a reminder that air frying rewards prep (uniformity) and monitoring over "set it and forget it." Great first try, though—most people burn the whole batch!

### How to Do Better Next Time

Aim for crispy, golden potato chips (or wedges) every time. Here's a step-by-step improved method based on reliable techniques—total time ~25-30 mins, serves as a side for 2-4.

#### Prep (5 mins—key to even results)
- **Slice uniformly**: Use a mandoline or sharp knife for 3-5mm thick slices (about 1/8 inch). All the same thickness prevents the thick/thin drama. Pat dry with paper towels to remove excess starch/moisture—super important for crispiness.
- **Season smartly**: Toss in 1-2 tsp oil (olive or avocado works), salt, pepper, and optional garlic powder/paprika. Oil helps browning without sogginess. Skip if you want oil-free, but expect less crisp.

#### Cooking (20-25 mins)
1. **Preheat the air fryer**: 3-5 mins at 190°C. This kickstarts even cooking.
2. **Load right**: Don't overcrowd—single layer max, with space for air flow. If too many, do batches.
3. **Cook in stages**:
   - First 10-12 mins at 180-190°C: This gently cooks through without burning edges.
   - Shake/flip halfway (at 5-6 mins) to even it out.
   - Check at 10 mins: Thinner slices done? Remove them to a plate. Continue thicker ones 5-8 more mins if needed.
   - Total: Aim for 15-20 mins total at 180-190°C. No need for 200°C unless they're still pale—bump to 195°C max for the last 2-3 mins only.
4. **Test doneness**: Edges golden-brown and crispy, inside fork-tender (not hard). If still chewy, add 2-min increments at 180°C.

#### Pro Tips
- **Avoid burning**: If they start darkening, lower to 170°C or pull out early. Use parchment liner if your basket sticks.
- **Batch tweak**: For thicker slices next time, parboil 2-3 mins first (drain/dry well) to speed internal cooking.
- **Storage**: Leftovers? Reheat at 160°C for 3-5 mins to recrisp.

This should give you restaurant-level results. Experiment with one potato first to dial it in. What's your go-to seasoning?
