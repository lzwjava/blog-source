Good — with the `iter 100` timing you showed, I can give a concrete estimate.

### Raw calculation (based on your observed pace)

* reported time per iteration at `iter 100`: **3995.11 ms = 3.99511 s / iter**
* remaining iterations: **6000 − 100 = 5900**
* remaining time = **5900 × 3.99511 s = 23,571.149 s = 6 hours 32 minutes 51 seconds**

So **at the current pace you’ll need ~6 hours 32 minutes 51 seconds** to finish the remaining 5900 iterations.

### Important assumptions & caveats

* This assumes the **3.995 s/iter** remains constant for the rest of the run.
* In practice timings usually change:

  * they often **improve** after warmup/compilation finishes, or when caching/warmup I/O completes;
  * they can **worsen** if periodic evaluations, checkpoints, or data pipeline stalls happen.
* Your `iter 0` was much slower (compile + warmup). `iter 100` is a more realistic measure — but still early.

### Practical ranges (what you might actually see)

* **If it stays at 3.995 s/iter** → ~**6.5 hours** (as above).
* **If it improves to 0.2 s/iter** → ~**20 minutes**.
* **If it improves to 0.15 s/iter** (optimistic for the 40M model on a 4070) → ~**15 minutes**.

### Quick tips to reduce time if you want it faster

* Check data-loading: increase `num_workers`, use `pin_memory`, ensure the dataset is on a fast local SSD and preprocessed (parquet → memmap). I/O stalls frequently cause multi-second iterations.
* If you have headroom, increase `batch_size` (or reduce `gradient_accumulation_steps`) to reduce number of optimizer steps — but only if it fits memory.
* Try a run with `compile=False` as a quick experiment — sometimes `torch.compile` can be slower on some setups/Inductor configs.
* Disable or reduce heavy logging/eval/checkpoint frequency while profiling throughput.

If you want, paste `iter 101..110` logs (or the next few) and I’ll compute the running average and a tighter ETA, and point out whether the time is trending down.
