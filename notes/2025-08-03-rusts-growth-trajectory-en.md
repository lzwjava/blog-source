Yes, the claim holds up based on current trends in programming language adoption and development. Rust, which achieved its first stable release in 2015 (much later than C in 1972, C++ in 1985, and Java in 1995), is indeed gaining ground rapidly compared to these established languages. This acceleration is driven by technological advancements (including performance and safety features), AI integration, and a vibrant open-source community. While Rust hasn't fully "caught up" in terms of sheer user base or legacy ecosystem size, its growth trajectory suggests it could close the gap in specific domains like systems programming, cloud infrastructure, and AI/ML within the next few years. Below, I'll break this down.

### Rust's Late Start and Current Standing
- **Historical Context**: Rust was designed by Mozilla to address pain points in older languages, such as memory safety issues in C/C++ and performance overhead in Java. Its late entry means it lacks the decades of entrenched use in enterprise systems (e.g., Java's dominance in Android and backend servers) or low-level software (e.g., C/C++ in operating systems and games).
- **Popularity Metrics**: As of mid-2025, Rust ranks around 13-15 in indices like TIOBE (up from outside the top 20 a few years ago), with a rating of about 1.5%. In contrast, C++ is often in the top 3 (around 9-10%), C in the top 5 (similar), and Java in the top 5 (around 7-8%). In PYPL (based on tutorial searches), Rust is climbing into the top 10 for in-demand languages. Stack Overflow surveys consistently rate Rust as the "most admired" language (83% in 2024, holding strong into 2025), indicating high developer satisfaction and desire to adopt it.

### Factors Accelerating Rust's Catch-Up
- **Technological Advancements**: Rust's built-in features like ownership models prevent common bugs (e.g., null pointers, data races) that plague C/C++, while matching or exceeding their performance. This makes it appealing for modern use cases like WebAssembly, blockchain, and embedded systems. For instance, Rust enables faster development cycles with less debugging compared to C++, and it's increasingly used in high-stakes areas like Linux kernel contributions (approved since 2021). Compared to Java, Rust offers better resource efficiency without garbage collection overhead, making it suitable for edge computing and real-time applications.
  
- **AI's Role**: AI tools are boosting Rust's adoption by lowering the learning curve and enhancing productivity. AI-powered code assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, RustCoder) generate safe Rust code, automate testing, and provide tutorials, making it easier for developers from C/C++/Java backgrounds to transition. Rust is also emerging in AI/ML itself due to its speed and safety—libraries like Tch (for PyTorch bindings) enable high-performance AI without Python's overhead. This creates a feedback loop: AI accelerates Rust development, and Rust powers efficient AI systems, leading to faster ecosystem growth.

- **Open-Source Communities**: Rust's community is highly active and inclusive, with strong backing from companies like AWS, Microsoft, and Google. The Cargo package manager and crates.io ecosystem have grown exponentially, now hosting over 100,000 crates. Open-source contributions are driving rapid improvements, such as better interoperability with C/C++ (via FFI) and Java (via JNI wrappers). This contrasts with the more fragmented communities of older languages, allowing Rust to iterate quickly on modern needs.

### Evidence of Fast Catch-Up
- **Growth Rates**: Rust's adoption is projected at 25%+ year-over-year in 2025, particularly in cloud, cybersecurity, and AI—far outpacing the stable or slight declines in C/C++ (e.g., C dropped 1% in TIOBE recently) and Java's steady but slower growth (around 5-10%). Developer counts: Rust has about 2.3 million users (up from under 1 million in 2020), while Java has 12-15 million, C++ 6-8 million, and C 4-6 million. However, Rust's momentum is evident in job postings (rising on platforms like Hacker News) and big tech shifts (e.g., Android adding Rust support, Discord rewriting in Rust for performance).
  
- **Challenges and Realism**: Rust isn't overtaking yet—its steeper learning curve and smaller library ecosystem (compared to Java's vast Maven repo or C++'s mature tools) slow broad adoption. C/C++ remain irreplaceable in legacy codebases, and Java dominates enterprise. But in new projects, Rust is often chosen over them for safety and speed, suggesting it could reach parity in niche areas by 2030.

In summary, yes—Rust's late start hasn't hindered it; instead, tech innovations, AI assistance, and community drive have enabled rapid progress. It's not there yet, but the pace is impressive and sustainable.
