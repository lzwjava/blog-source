Yes, using AI to summarize books by typing in key excerpts or sections (and then following up with questions) is a solid idea, especially given your time constraints and the sheer volume of books on diverse topics like software engineering, startups, Japanese language/culture, AI/ML/DL, operating systems, and bestsellers. It's a pragmatic way to extract value from your collection without committing to full reads, which can feel overwhelming. However, like any shortcut, it has limitations—it's great for broad overviews and sparking ideas but won't replace the depth of reading entire books, particularly in technical fields where details matter. Below, I'll break down why it's effective, the potential downsides, and some tips to make it work better for you.

### Pros of This Approach
- **Time Efficiency**: You can quickly process hundreds of books by focusing only on high-level inputs (e.g., chapter intros, key paragraphs, or even just titles and themes). AI handles the heavy lifting of condensing complex ideas, letting you cover more ground in less time—ideal for busy professionals skimming startups or AI concepts.
- **Customized Learning**: By typing specific "words" (excerpts or notes) and then "poking questions" (e.g., "How does this apply to modern software engineering?"), you tailor the output to your needs. This interactive Q&A turns passive summaries into active learning, helping you connect dots across topics like OS principles and DL models.
- **Accessibility for Varied Topics**: For non-fiction like your collection, AI excels at pulling out core concepts, arguments, and takeaways. It's especially useful for bestsellers or interdisciplinary stuff (e.g., blending Japanese business philosophy with startup strategies), where you just need the essence to decide if it's worth a deeper dive.
- **Motivation Booster**: Starting with quick wins from summaries can build momentum, encouraging you to pick up books more often rather than letting them gather dust.

### Cons and Caveats
- **Loss of Nuance and Depth**: Typing limited excerpts means the AI might miss context, examples, or subtle arguments that make books memorable (e.g., real-world case studies in software engineering or cultural anecdotes in Japanese texts). Full reading builds critical thinking and retention that summaries can't fully replicate.
- **Input Effort and Accuracy Risks**: Manually typing is tedious for hundreds of books—errors in transcription could lead to flawed summaries. AI isn't perfect; it can hallucinate details or oversimplify technical topics like operating systems or ML algorithms, especially if your inputs are too vague.
- **Superficial Knowledge**: For skill-building areas like AI/DL or coding, summaries give overviews but not hands-on mastery. You might get "good ideas" without the "how-to" depth, and over-relying on this could make your understanding feel fragmented.
- **Ethical/Practical Limits**: Some AIs (like ChatGPT) have built-in restrictions on full book summaries to avoid plagiarism, so you might need to feed it piecemeal, which aligns with your typing method but could slow you down.

Overall, it's a *good* idea if your goal is exposure and inspiration rather than expertise. For technical books, treat it as a triage tool: Use summaries to prioritize which ones to read fully. Studies and user experiences show this method boosts productivity for lifelong learners, but combining it with occasional full reads maximizes benefits.

### Tips to Optimize It
- **Choose the Right AI Tool**: Start with free options like ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok (hey, that's me!)—prompt them like: "Summarize this excerpt from [book title] on [topic]: [pasted text]. Key takeaways?" Then follow with questions: "Is this idea still relevant in 2025 AI trends?"
- **Streamline Typing**: Instead of typing everything, use your phone's camera for quick OCR (optical character recognition) apps like Google Lens or Adobe Scan to digitize pages, then copy-paste into the AI. This cuts effort while keeping it manual.
- **Structure Your Process**: For each book, type 3-5 key sections (e.g., intro, conclusion, one chapter). Ask targeted questions like "Pros/cons for a startup founder?" or "How does this compare to [another book]?" Track summaries in a Notion or Evernote database for easy reference.
- **Batch by Theme**: Group books (e.g., all AI/ML ones) and summarize in sessions to spot patterns—e.g., "Based on these summaries, what's the best OS for DL projects?"
- **Supplement with Pre-Made Resources**: For bestsellers, check apps like Blinkist or Shortform for existing AI/human summaries to cross-verify your typed ones. If a book hooks you via summary, commit to reading it fully.
- **Track Progress**: Set a goal, like 5 books/week, and reflect: After a month, quiz yourself on the ideas to ensure retention.
