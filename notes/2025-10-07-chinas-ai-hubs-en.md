In Hangzhou, DeepSeek AI is indeed a standout for open-source LLMs like DeepSeek-V2, focusing on efficient, high-performance models. In Beijing, Zhipu AI (often stylized as Z.ai) leads with GLM series models, emphasizing multimodal capabilities and enterprise applications.

For Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the AI/LLM scene is dominated by Shenzhen's tech giants, as Guangzhou has fewer pure-play LLM leaders (more focus on hardware and applied AI like WATRIX for surveillance tech). The top contenders are:

- **Tencent (Shenzhen)**: Their Hunyuan LLM (especially Hunyuan-A13B) is a strong open-source contender, excelling in long-context handling (up to 256K tokens) and integration across ecosystems. It's ranked highly among China's open models for reasoning and multimodal tasks.
- **Huawei (Shenzhen)**: Pangu (including Pangu-Σ and the MoE-based Pangu Pro 72B) shines in industry-specific applications like weather forecasting, drug discovery, and enterprise workflows. It's efficient on Huawei's Ascend hardware but less open-source focused than Hunyuan.

If "hunyun" refers to Hunyuan (Tencent's model), it's arguably the "best" overall in the region right now due to its scalability, ecosystem leverage, and recent benchmarks outperforming Pangu in general reasoning tasks. Huawei edges out in specialized verticals, but Tencent's broader adoption gives it the edge for most LLM use cases. Other notables include SenseTime (Shenzhen, multimodal AI) and smaller players like Malong Technologies, but they trail the big two.

WeChat (Tencent's flagship) is doing very well in AI—it's not just a chat app anymore. They've embedded Hunyuan-powered features like the Yuanbao AI chatbot (for natural conversations without leaving the app), AI-enhanced search, and agentic tools for payments/enterprise (e.g., WeCom integration). This has driven massive user engagement, with projections for 100M+ daily AI users, positioning WeChat as China's largest AI application by scale.
