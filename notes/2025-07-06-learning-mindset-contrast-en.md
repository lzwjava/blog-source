It sounds like you're describing two contrasting approaches to learning and success, and the different emotional outcomes that result from each. Let's break down how to understand or comprehend these dynamics.

**Understanding the "Rush to Success" Mindset:**

When someone "rushes to success" by focusing on things like passing scores, getting a degree quickly, or earning money, their primary motivation is often **extrinsic**. This means their drive comes from external rewards or validation. Here's how to comprehend their struggles:

* **Goal-Oriented, Not Process-Oriented:** Their focus is almost entirely on the *outcome* (the score, the degree, the money) rather than the *process* of learning or growing.
* **Fragile Self-Worth:** Their self-worth can become heavily tied to these external achievements. If they don't achieve them quickly or easily, it can feel like a personal failure.
* **Lack of Intrinsic Motivation:** Because they aren't driven by genuine curiosity or a love for the subject, difficulties aren't seen as opportunities for growth, but as roadblocks.
* **Fear of Failure:** The pressure to achieve external benchmarks can lead to a strong fear of failure. This fear makes obstacles feel insurmountable and directly impacts their emotional state.
* **Emotional Response to Obstacles:**
    * **Upset/Frustration:** When an obstacle appears, it directly threatens their ability to achieve their external goal, leading to immediate upset and frustration.
    * **Accumulation of Negative Emotions:** Each setback isn't processed as a learning experience but as a blow. These negative feelings build up.
    * **Pressure/Depression/Anger:** This accumulation of negative emotions, combined with the underlying fear of not meeting external expectations, can easily lead to significant mental pressure, feelings of depression, or anger (at themselves, the situation, or others). The brain interprets these obstacles as threats to its perceived pathway to "success," leading to a stress response.

**Understanding the "Learning for Its Own Purpose" Mindset:**

In contrast, someone who learns "for its own purpose" is driven by **intrinsic motivation**. Their reward comes from the act of learning itself, understanding, and personal growth. Here's how to comprehend their delight in difficulties:

* **Process-Oriented, Not Just Goal-Oriented:** While they might have goals, the journey of learning and discovery is just as, if not more, important.
* **Growth Mindset:** They likely possess a "growth mindset," where challenges are seen as opportunities to learn and develop new skills, rather than as indicators of their innate ability.
* **Resilience:** Difficulties are viewed as puzzles to solve, not walls to hit. This fosters resilience, as they understand that overcoming challenges is part of the learning process.
* **Intrinsic Satisfaction:** The satisfaction comes from grappling with complex ideas, mastering a new skill, or deepening their understanding, regardless of external validation.
* **Emotional Response to Obstacles:**
    * **Delight/Curiosity:** When meeting difficulties, their brain doesn't register it as a threat but as an interesting problem. This can evoke curiosity and even delight ("Ah, an interesting challenge!").
    * **Engagement:** Instead of withdrawing, they are more likely to lean in, explore different solutions, and experiment.
    * **Sense of Accomplishment:** Overcoming a difficulty is a profound source of intrinsic satisfaction, reinforcing their positive feelings about the learning process.
    * **Reduced Pressure:** Since their self-worth isn't tied to external metrics, the pressure is significantly reduced, allowing them to approach challenges with a clearer, more open mind.

**How to Comprehend/Understand Both:**

To truly comprehend these differences, consider:

1.  **Motivation Source:** Is the person driven by external rewards (money, grades, recognition) or internal satisfaction (curiosity, mastery, personal growth)?
2.  **Perception of Failure/Obstacles:** Do they see obstacles as personal failures and roadblocks, or as opportunities for learning and improvement?
3.  **Locus of Control:** Do they feel in control of their learning process and outcomes, or do they feel their success is dependent on external factors?
4.  **Emotional Regulation:** How well do they manage their emotions when faced with setbacks? Does it lead to a downward spiral, or do they reframe it positively?
5.  **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Focus:** Is their focus on quick, immediate results, or on a deeper, more sustained journey of development?

By asking these questions and observing their reactions, you can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mindset driving their behavior and emotional responses.
