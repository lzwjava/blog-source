Yeah, you're spot on—information does spread way faster and with way more depth now compared to the 90s and early 00s, even for massive events. Back then, traditional media like newspapers, radio, and TV were the main pipelines, so while big stories could hit the airwaves quickly, the full picture often trickled out over days or weeks due to verification needs, limited footage, and no real-time sharing from everyday people. Today, with smartphones, social media, and AI tools, it's almost instantaneous: live videos, personal accounts, memes, graphs, and even generated content flood in within minutes, making everything feel more vivid and chaotic, like a digital typhoon itself.

Take Tiananmen Square in 1989 (right on the edge of the 90s): The protests kicked off in mid-April after a reformist leader's death, building over weeks with student-led marches drawing global attention via on-the-ground reporters. But the brutal crackdown on June 3-4? Initial reports leaked out through smuggled footage and eyewitnesses, hitting international TV like BBC within hours, yet the censored details—death tolls, Tank Man images—took days to confirm and spread widely via papers and wire services. No viral clips from protesters' phones; it was all filtered through official channels or brave journalists.

Fast-forward to 9/11 in 2001: This one moved quicker thanks to 24/7 cable news. The first plane hit at 8:46 AM ET, and live broadcasts captured the second impact 17 minutes later, confirming it as an attack. Radio and early websites amplified it globally within the hour, but deeper analysis, victim stories, and raw footage still rolled out over days via TV specials and print. Social media wasn't a thing yet—no instant eyewitness tweets or AI recreations—just stunned anchors looping the same clips.

Now contrast that with Kobe Bryant's death in 2020: Helicopter crash around 9:45 AM PST on January 26, emergency calls went out immediately, and TMZ broke the story (including confirmation of fatalities) by 11:30 AM—under two hours later. Twitter and Instagram exploded with tributes, crash site photos, and fan videos right away; by afternoon, it was a full multimedia storm of timelines, memes, and personal reactions. The rush even led to some early misinformation, but the speed was unmatched.

Or Charlie Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025—just weeks ago as of today: News hit X and news sites within minutes of the event in what sounds like a public shooting tied to his conservative activism. By evening, you had raw footage, eyewitness threads, AI-generated "what if" scenarios, protest videos, and heated debates from personal accounts all over the platform. Free speech fallout and disciplinary actions against commenters followed in real-time, turning it into a global firestorm overnight.

And typhoons? Spot on again—social media has turbocharged that. Pre-2010s, you'd get official bulletins via radio/TV, maybe satellite images days later. Now, during something like Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 (an early example), users posted live updates, damage pics, and calls for help that shaped global aid responses in hours. Recent ones in 2025? It's nonstop: drone videos, progress maps crowdsourced on X, AI forecasts, and influencer breakdowns, all mixing verified reports with raw chaos. It saves lives faster but amps up the noise too.

In short, the 90s/00s had the tech for "fast" by that era's standards, but it was linear and gatekept. Now it's a wildfire—richer, messier, and relentless. What do you think drives the biggest difference: the tools or just more voices?
