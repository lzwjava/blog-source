Yes, your observation captures a stark contrast in development between Hong Kong and mainland China during the 1980s and 1990s, rooted in their vastly different political and economic paths. Hong Kong, as a British colony until 1997, was a bustling entrepôt with open markets, attracting global trade and investment, while mainland China was still emerging from decades of isolation under communist rule, with rural areas lagging far behind urban centers. Let me break it down with some context.

### Access to Global Consumer Goods
In the 1980s and early 1990s, Hong Kong residents indeed had early and widespread access to the world's top consumer electronics and appliances—think Sony TVs from Japan, Whirlpool washing machines from the US, Motorola phones, and IBM or Apple computers. This was fueled by HK's role as a free port and manufacturing hub turned service economy, where imports from Europe, the US, and Japan flooded department stores like Sogo or Lane Crawford. By the mid-1980s, HK's economy had shifted dramatically toward finance and trade, with re-exports (including high-end goods) making up over 40% of its total exports. The "HK wave" in pop culture and branding even amplified this, with locals flaunting imported luxuries as status symbols amid booming wealth creation.

In contrast, mainland China's consumer goods market was tightly controlled, with limited imports and a focus on basic needs. Rural households, which made up about 70-80% of the population, relied heavily on state-subsidized or locally made items—often low-quality knockoffs or nothing at all for advanced tech. Urban elites in Beijing or Shanghai might snag some imports via special channels, but everyday folks in villages were worlds apart.

### Electricity in Rural Mainland China
You're spot on about the electricity gap. In the 1980s, only about 70-78% of rural households had reliable access to electricity, leaving roughly 200-300 million people (mostly in remote villages in provinces like Gansu or Yunnan) without it for lighting, let alone powering appliances. Blackouts were common even where grids reached, due to coal shortages and underinvestment. It wasn't until the mid-1990s "rural electrification drive" that coverage hit 90%+, but in the 80s, many villages used kerosene lamps or firewood well into the decade. HK, meanwhile, had near-universal electricity since the 1960s, powering its neon-lit nightlife and high-rises without a hitch.

### Hong Kong's Vibe: A Mini-NYC, SF, or Tokyo?
Absolutely—HK in the 80s and 90s felt like a scrappier, hyper-efficient version of those cities, blending East-West glamour with relentless hustle. It was Asia's "Wall Street East," ranking as the world's third-largest financial center behind New York and London by the early 90s, with more foreign banks than Tokyo and syndicated loans rivaling global hubs. Per capita GDP soared (up 87x from 1961-1997), skyscrapers like the Bank of China Tower pierced the sky, and the stock exchange buzzed like the NYSE.

Lifestyle-wise, it echoed San Francisco's innovative edge (early tech boom with firms like PCCW) and New York's melting-pot energy, but with Tokyo's disciplined efficiency—no red tape, projects finished ahead of schedule, and a "time is money" ethos that made London seem stuffy by comparison. Late 80s HK was peak optimism: free parking in Central, tree-lined streets, and a refugee-driven ambition that turned it into a city of opportunity. Sure, it was crowded and pricey (office rents rivaled Tokyo's), but the vibe was electric—Cantopop blasting, dim sum brunches, and deals cut over congee, all under British rule's light touch.

By the 90s handover jitters, some emigrated, but HK's global stature held firm, outshining many peers in trade volume and billionaire density. It wasn't identical to those cities (smaller scale, more subtropical chaos), but yeah, it punched way above its weight as a world-class playground for the ambitious.
