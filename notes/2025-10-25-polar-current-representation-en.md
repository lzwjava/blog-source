The polar representation of an electric current is typically used when dealing with alternating current (AC) in electrical engineering, where currents are often represented as phasors in the complex plane. Here's an explanation in English:

**Polar Representation of Electric Current**

In the context of AC circuits, electric current can be represented as a phasor, which is a complex number that encapsulates both the magnitude (amplitude) and phase angle of the current. The polar form is one way to express this phasor.

1. **Definition**:
   - In polar form, the current \\( I \\) is expressed as:
     \\[
     I = I_m \angle \theta
     \\]
     where:
     - \\( I_m \\) is the magnitude (or amplitude) of the current, typically measured in amperes (A).
     - \\( \theta \\) is the phase angle, measured in degrees or radians, which indicates the time shift of the current relative to a reference (e.g., a voltage waveform or a reference time).

2. **Relation to Rectangular Form**:
   - The polar form is equivalent to the rectangular form of the current in the complex plane:
     \\[
     I = I_x + j I_y
     \\]
     where \\( I_x = I_m \cos(\theta) \\) and \\( I_y = I_m \sin(\theta) \\).
     - The magnitude \\( I_m \\) is calculated as:
       \\[
       I_m = \sqrt{I_x^2 + I_y^2}
       \\]
     - The phase angle \\( \theta \\) is calculated as:
       \\[
       \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{I_y}{I_x}\right)
       \\]

3. **Why Use Polar Form?**:
   - **Simplifies Analysis**: In AC circuit analysis, polar form is convenient for multiplying or dividing phasors (e.g., when calculating impedance effects), as it involves multiplying magnitudes and adding/subtracting phase angles.
   - **Physical Interpretation**: The magnitude \\( I_m \\) represents the peak or RMS (root mean square) value of the AC current, while the phase angle \\( \theta \\) describes how the current waveform is shifted in time relative to a reference.

4. **Example**:
   - Suppose an AC current is described as \\( I = 10 \angle 30^\circ \\).
     - This means the current has a magnitude of 10 A (peak or RMS, depending on convention) and is phase-shifted by 30 degrees relative to the reference.
     - In rectangular form, this would be:
       \\[
       I = 10 \cos(30^\circ) + j 10 \sin(30^\circ) = 8.66 + j 5
       \\]

5. **Applications**:
   - Polar representation is widely used in power systems, signal processing, and circuit analysis (e.g., in solving for currents in RLC circuits).
   - It simplifies calculations involving impedance, power factor, and phase relationships in AC systems.

This representation is particularly useful in steady-state AC analysis, where currents and voltages are sinusoidal and can be treated as rotating vectors (phasors) in the complex plane.
