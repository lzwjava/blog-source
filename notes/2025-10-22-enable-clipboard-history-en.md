### Enabling Clipboard History in Windows
Before using shortcuts, ensure the feature is enabled (it's available in Windows 10 version 1809 and later, including Windows 11):
1. Open **Settings** (press `Windows key + I`).
2. Go to **System > Clipboard**.
3. Toggle on **Clipboard history**.

This allows Windows to store up to 25 recent items (text, HTML, images) for 1 hour by default, or longer if synced to a Microsoft account.

### Using Shortcuts to Access and Read Clipboard History
The primary keyboard shortcut to open and read your clipboard history is **`Windows key + V`**. Here's how to use it step by step:

1. **Copy multiple items**: Use `Ctrl + C` to copy text, images, or other content as needed. Windows will automatically save them to history.

2. **Open clipboard history**: Press `Windows key + V`. This launches a searchable pane on the right side of your screen showing thumbnails or previews of recent clips (most recent at the top).

3. **Navigate and read**:
   - Use **arrow keys** (↑/↓) to scroll through the list.
   - **Type to search**: As the pane opens, you can immediately start typing to filter items (e.g., search for a keyword in copied text).
   - **Preview**: Hover over or arrow to an item to see a preview without pasting.

4. **Paste from history**:
   - Select an item with arrow keys and press **Enter** to paste it at your cursor.
   - Or click the item if using the mouse.

5. **Close the pane**: Press `Esc` or `Windows key + V` again.

### Additional Tips
- **Pin items**: In the pane, click the pin icon next to an item to keep it indefinitely.
- **Clear history**: Right-click an item > **Delete**, or go to Settings > System > Clipboard > **Clear**.
- **Sync across devices**: Enable **Clipboard history sync** in Settings for access on other Windows PCs signed into the same Microsoft account.
- If you want to customize the shortcut (e.g., remap it), use third-party tools like AutoHotkey, but the default `Win + V` is built-in and reliable.
