A query engine is a component of a database management system (DBMS) that interprets and executes database queries (typically written in SQL or a similar language). Its main function is to process the queries and return the appropriate results. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

### 1. **Parsing the Query:**
   - **Lexical Analysis:** The first step is parsing the query to check its syntax. The engine uses a lexical analyzer to break down the query into tokens (e.g., keywords, identifiers, operators).
   - **Syntax Analysis:** Then, it parses the tokens into a query tree or parse tree to validate that the structure of the query is correct. It checks whether the query follows the proper grammar and whether the referenced tables, columns, and conditions are valid.

### 2. **Optimization:**
   - **Query Rewrite:** After parsing, the engine may rewrite the query to optimize it. This could involve simplifying certain parts of the query (e.g., removing redundant conditions or combining subqueries).
   - **Cost-Based Optimization:** The query optimizer generates multiple execution plans, and then evaluates the "cost" (based on factors like disk I/O, CPU usage, etc.) of each plan. The plan with the lowest cost is selected for execution. The optimizer may choose indexes, join methods (e.g., nested loops, hash join), and access paths based on statistics about the data.
   
### 3. **Execution Plan Generation:**
   - The query engine selects the optimal execution plan. This includes deciding on how to fetch data (using indexes, sequential scans, etc.) and how to join multiple tables.
   - The plan may also involve operations like sorting, filtering, grouping, and aggregation.

### 4. **Execution:**
   - The engine executes the plan by performing the necessary operations in a specific sequence. For example, if it needs to join two tables, it might use a hash join or a nested loop join depending on the plan chosen by the optimizer.
   - During execution, the engine may fetch data from disk (if it’s not cached) and process the results.

### 5. **Return Results:**
   - After execution, the query engine returns the results to the user or application. The results could be in the form of a set of rows and columns (for SELECT queries), an acknowledgment (for INSERT/UPDATE queries), or an error message if something went wrong.

### Key Components of a Query Engine:
- **Parser:** Validates and parses SQL queries into an internal form.
- **Optimizer:** Finds the best possible execution plan for the query.
- **Executor:** Executes the chosen plan and retrieves data from the database.
- **Cache:** Frequently accessed data may be cached to speed up execution of subsequent queries.

### Example:
Let’s say you run a query like:
```sql
SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 30 ORDER BY age;
```

1. **Parsing:** The query is parsed into a syntax tree.
2. **Optimization:** The optimizer might determine the best way to filter users older than 30 and possibly use an index on the `age` column if available.
3. **Execution:** The engine retrieves the relevant rows from the `users` table, applies the filter, and sorts the results by `age`.
4. **Return Results:** The engine returns the sorted results (e.g., a list of users who are older than 30).
