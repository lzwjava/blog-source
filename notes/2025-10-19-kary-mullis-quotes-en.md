### Top Quotes by Kary Mullis

Kary Mullis, the Nobel Prize-winning biochemist who invented the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), was known for his witty, irreverent, and often provocative views on science, society, and skepticism. Here are 10 of his most notable quotes, drawn from his writings and interviews:

1. "Science, like nothing else among the institutions of mankind, grows like a weed every year. Art is subject to arbitrary fashion, religion is inwardly focused and driven only to sustain itself, law shuttles between freeing us and enslaving us."

2. "Scientists are doing an awful lot of damage to the world in the name of helping it. I don't mind attacking my own fraternity because I am ashamed of it."

3. "The mystery of that damn virus has been generated by the $2 billion a year they spend on it."

4. "It’s not even probable, let alone scientifically proven, that HIV causes AIDS. If there is evidence that HIV causes AIDS, there should be scientific documents which either singly or collectively demonstrate that fact, at least with a high probability. There are no such documents."

5. "We are the recipients of scientific method. We can each be a creative and active part of it if we so desire."

6. "Any time a magnet wiggles, no matter how small it is, or how fast or slow it wiggles, it makes some kind of light. Most light is made by little magnets called molecules, and our eyes are tuned to a very narrow range of it."

7. "The biggest battle I fought with the danger officer was over the fact that I insisted on keeping my lunch and a case of Beck’s beer in the same fridge in which I kept my radioactive isotopes."

8. "If there is something in my food that somebody says is a poison, I want to have the chemistry explained and decide for myself whether or not I want to eat it."

9. "You can't ask your pharmacist to stock larger quantities of potassium nitrate because you want to make a bigger rocket."

10. "I encountered a glowing green raccoon riding a neon orange motorcycle at my cabin in the woods of northern California around midnight one night in 1985. The raccoon proceeded to metamorphose into a singing dolphin at the stroke of midnight."
