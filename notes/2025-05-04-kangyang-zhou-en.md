Kangyang Zhou, born in 2007 in Hangzhou, China, is a prodigious competitive programmer widely regarded as one of the most exceptional talents in the global competitive programming community. Known by his online handles "zh0ukangyang" on AtCoder and "orzdevinwang" on Codeforces, Zhou has achieved unprecedented success at a remarkably young age, including holding the highest rating in the world on Codeforces and earning a perfect score at the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). As of May 2025, Zhou is a high school student at Hangzhou No. 2 High School and a member of the Explosive Vegetable Club, a group associated with his competitive programming activities. His extraordinary achievements, including multiple world-class titles and a Codeforces rating of 3695 (peaking at 3844), have solidified his reputation as a legendary figure in the sport, though his use of multiple accounts has sparked some controversy.

### Early Life and Introduction to Competitive Programming
Zhou’s journey in competitive programming began at a young age, likely during his early school years, given his participation in high-level international competitions by his mid-teens. Born in 2007, he demonstrated an early aptitude for mathematics and algorithmic problem-solving, skills that are critical to success in competitive programming. His rapid rise in the field suggests he started competing in local or national contests in China, a country with a strong tradition of nurturing talent in programming olympiads. By the time he was 16, Zhou was already dominating global competitions, showcasing a level of skill and maturity far beyond his years.

His participation in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) as a high school student marked a significant milestone in his career. The IOI, one of the most prestigious programming competitions for high schoolers, requires deep knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving under strict time constraints. Zhou’s performance at the IOI 2024, where he achieved a perfect score of 600/600, set a new benchmark for excellence in the competition and established him as a global leader in the field.[](https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/indianorigin-teen-son-of-iit-jee-topper-wins-gold-at-world-s-toughest-programming-contest-101725948626514.html)

2. **Codeforces Ranking and Rating**:
   - Zhou is the highest-rated programmer on Codeforces, a leading competitive programming platform, with a current rating of 3695 and a peak rating of 3844, earning him the title of Legendary Grandmaster. His handles "zh0ukangyang" and "orzdevinwang" have both ranked in the global top 10, with "orzdevinwang" solving 1884 problems overall and 167 in the last year as of May 2025. His dominance on Codeforces has been described as “out of this world,” particularly given his young age.[](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/123690)[](https://codeforces.com/topic/124315/en1)[](https://codeforces.com/profile/orzdevinwang)

3. **AtCoder Performance**:
   - Under the handle "zh0ukangyang," Zhou is a prominent competitor on AtCoder, another major competitive programming platform. While specific AtCoder achievements are less documented in available sources, his participation in AtCoder contests and high ranking align with his overall reputation as a top-tier programmer.[](https://cphof.org/profile/codeforces:orzdevinwang)[](https://cphof.org/profile/atcoder:zhoukangyang)

4. **Other Competitions**:
   - Zhou has likely participated in additional national and international contests, such as those organized in China, given his affiliation with Hangzhou No. 2 High School, which has a strong programming olympiad program. His consistent performance across platforms suggests success in events like the China National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) or similar competitions, though specific details are not widely publicized.

### Controversy Over Multiple Accounts
Zhou’s career has not been without controversy. In 2023 and 2024, Codeforces blogs highlighted that Zhou maintained two accounts, "zh0ukangyang" and "orzdevinwang," both ranking in the global top 10, in violation of Codeforces’ rule against multiple accounts. While some community members argued that Zhou did not use these accounts to cheat (e.g., by collaborating during contests), the issue sparked debate about fairness and community standards. Defenders noted that Zhou’s skill level was so high that he would likely achieve top ranks with a single account, as evidenced by his perfect IOI score and consistent performance. The controversy has not led to formal sanctions, but it remains a point of discussion in the competitive programming community.[](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/123690)[](https://codeforces.com/topic/124315/en1)[](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/124435)
