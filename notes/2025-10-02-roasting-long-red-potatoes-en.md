### Understanding Your Clarification
Got it—now referring to fresh red potatoes (specifically long ones, about 20cm/8 inches long each), not sweet potatoes. These are firm, waxy potatoes that hold shape well when cooked. The oven setup remains the same: microwave with convection (fan for air circulation), and both top and bottom heating enabled for even roasting/baking.

Assuming these are whole, unpeeled fresh potatoes (wash them thoroughly). If "long 20cm" means one extra-large potato or a batch stacked, adjust times upward. For multiple, cook in a single layer if possible. Standard assumption: 1-2 medium-large red potatoes per session in a 1000W convection microwave.

### Recommended Cooking Method and Time
- **Power/Setting**: Convection mode at 180-200°C with top/bottom heat on (like a "roast" or "bake" function if available). Use the fan for crispiness.
- **Preparation**: Prick each potato 3-4 times with a fork. Drizzle with a touch of oil (or not for healthier, steamier results) and season lightly with salt/pepper if desired. Place on a microwave-safe dish or rack, spaced apart.
- **Cooking Time**: About 12-18 minutes total per potato (check midway for evenness).
  - Start at 6-8 minutes, then pause, rotate/flip, and continue in 2-3-minute increments.
  - They're done when a fork pierces easily to the center without breaking apart—soft inside, slightly crisp outside if oiled.
  - For a 20cm long potato (roughly twice the size of a medium one), aim for 18-25 minutes, testing from both ends, as thickness can cause uneven cooking.
- **After Cooking**: Rest 2-3 minutes to let juices redistribute. Avoid overcooking, as red potatoes can turn mealy if too tender.

### Tips for Best Results
- **Size Adjustment**: At 20cm long, it's like two standard potatoes—split into halves if needed for faster, more uniform cooking. If cooking a batch, add 5-10 minutes total and stir midway.
- **Variations**: For fluffier texture, cut into cubes first and microwave in a covered dish with 1/4 cup water (reduce time to 5-8 minutes). Skip convection for just steaming.
- **Safety/Evenness**: Microwaves can leave cold spots—always rotate. If your unit lacks convection controls, default to high microwave power with occasional stirring (add 5-10 minutes cooking time).
- **Nutritional Note**: Fresh red potatoes are rich in fiber; microwaving preserves nutrients better than boiling.

Recipe based on USDA and culinary standards (e.g., whole red potatoes bake in 45-60 minutes in a regular oven, but microwaves halve that via faster heating). Test your first batch and note any adjustments. If you meant something else (e.g., boiling, precise quantity), clarify!
