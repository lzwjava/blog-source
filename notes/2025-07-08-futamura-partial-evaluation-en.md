title: Futamura's Pioneering Contributions to Partial Evaluation
translated: false
---

Yoshihiko Futamura is a distinguished computer scientist widely recognized for his groundbreaking contributions to programming methodology, particularly in the field of **partial evaluation**. He is credited with inventing the **Futamura Projections**, which provide a theoretical framework for understanding and applying partial evaluation to program transformation, including the automatic generation of compilers.

Born in 1942, Futamura earned his Bachelor of Science in mathematics from Hokkaido University in 1965, a Master of Science in applied mathematics from Harvard University in 1973, and his Ph.D. from Hokkaido University in 1985. His career includes significant roles at Hitachi Central Research Laboratory, a professorship at the Department of Information and Computer Science at Waseda University, and directorship of the Institute for Software Production Technology (ISPT) at Waseda University from 1991 to 2005. He also held visiting professorships at Uppsala University and Harvard University.

Beyond partial evaluation, Futamura is also the inventor of the **Problem Analysis Diagram (PAD)**, a method for program development that has been adopted as an international standard (ISO8631) and a national standard of China (GB13502).

His research primarily focuses on the automatic generation of computer programs and programming methodology. He has published over 200 research papers and patents in these areas and has served on the editorial and advisory boards of prominent journals like the Journal of New Generation Computing and the Journal of Higher Order and Symbolic Computation. He is also a fellow of the Japan Society for Software Science and Technology.

In recent years, his work has extended into the field of drug discovery and gene therapy, applying his expertise in program transformation to develop strategies for identifying novel drug targets. He serves as director of InfiniteBio and is the President and Chairman of Futamura Institute, Inc., as well as being involved with Hinge Therapeutics.
