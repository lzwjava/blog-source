India is a linguistically diverse country with thousands of languages and dialects. Beyond Hindi and Tamil, other major languages include Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Punjabi, Assamese, Maithili, and others. These belong to two primary language families: Indo-Aryan (e.g., Hindi, Bengali) and Dravidian (e.g., Tamil, Telugu). English is also widely used as a link language, especially in urban areas, government, and business.

### Major Languages and Distribution
Based on the 2011 Census of India and other reliable sources, here’s a breakdown of major languages and their approximate speaker distribution:

- **Hindi**: Spoken by about 43.6% of the population (roughly 528 million in 2011) as a first or second language. It dominates northern and central India (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, etc.). It’s the official language of the central government alongside English.
- **Bengali**: Around 8.3% (97 million speakers), primarily in West Bengal and parts of Assam, Jharkhand, and Tripura.
- **Telugu**: About 6.7% (81 million), concentrated in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
- **Marathi**: Around 6.9% (83 million), mainly in Maharashtra.
- **Tamil**: Approximately 5.7% (69 million), spoken in Tamil Nadu and parts of Puducherry, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.
- **Gujarati**: About 4.6% (55 million), primarily in Gujarat.
- **Kannada**: Around 3.6% (44 million), spoken in Karnataka.
- **Malayalam**: About 2.9% (35 million), mainly in Kerala.
- **Odia**: Around 3.1% (38 million), spoken in Odisha.
- **Punjabi**: About 2.7% (33 million), concentrated in Punjab.
- **Assamese**: Around 1.3% (15 million), primarily in Assam.
- **Maithili**: About 1.1% (13 million), spoken in Bihar and Jharkhand.

The distribution reflects regional concentration, with each language tied to specific states or union territories, as India’s states were reorganized in the 1950s based on linguistic boundaries (e.g., Tamil Nadu for Tamil speakers, Maharashtra for Marathi speakers). Hindi has a broader spread due to its role as a lingua franca and its use in media, education, and politics in the "Hindi Belt."

### Historical Context
The linguistic diversity of India stems from its complex history:

1. **Ancient Roots**:
   - **Indo-Aryan Languages**: Originated with the arrival of Indo-European-speaking groups around 1500 BCE (Vedic period). Sanskrit, the liturgical language of Hinduism, evolved into Prakrits, which gave rise to modern languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi.
   - **Dravidian Languages**: Predate Indo-Aryan languages, with roots possibly dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300–1300 BCE). Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam form the core Dravidian family, with Tamil having one of the oldest literary traditions (Sangam literature, ~300 BCE–300 CE).
   - **Other Influences**: Austroasiatic (e.g., Munda languages) and Tibeto-Burman languages (e.g., Bodo, Manipuri) exist in eastern and northeastern India, reflecting ancient tribal and migratory patterns.

2. **Medieval Period**:
   - Persian and Arabic influences during the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526) and Mughal Empire (1526–1857) enriched vocabularies of languages like Hindi (via Urdu) and Bengali.
   - Regional kingdoms fostered literary traditions in Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, and others, often under royal patronage.

3. **Colonial Era**:
   - British colonization (1757–1947) elevated English as a language of administration and education, influencing urban elites and creating a bilingual administrative class.
   - Christian missionaries and printing presses standardized scripts and promoted literacy in regional languages like Tamil and Bengali.

4. **Post-Independence (1947–Present)**:
   - The Indian Constitution recognizes 22 scheduled languages (listed in the Eighth Schedule), including Hindi, Tamil, and others mentioned above. Hindi was promoted as a national link language, but English retained co-official status due to resistance from non-Hindi-speaking states, especially Tamil Nadu.
   - Linguistic reorganization of states in 1956 (e.g., Andhra Pradesh for Telugu speakers, Kerala for Malayalam speakers) reinforced regional language identities.
   - Political movements, like the anti-Hindi protests in Tamil Nadu (1960s), emphasized the importance of regional languages, leading to a “three-language formula” in education (local language, Hindi, English).

### Current Dynamics
- **Multilingualism**: Many Indians are bilingual or trilingual, often speaking their mother tongue, Hindi, and/or English. In urban areas, English is a key language for higher education and jobs.
- **Bollywood and Media**: Hindi’s dominance in Bollywood and national media amplifies its reach, even in non-Hindi regions.
- **Regional Pride**: Tamil, Bengali, and other languages have strong literary and cultural traditions, fostering regional identity and resistance to Hindi imposition.
- **Endangered Languages**: While major languages thrive, many smaller languages and dialects (e.g., Bhojpuri, Tulu) face decline due to urbanization and globalization.
