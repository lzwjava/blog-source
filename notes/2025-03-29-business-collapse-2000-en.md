Between 1995 and 2010, there were several major business collapses that made headlines due to their scale, impact on industries, and long-lasting consequences. Here are some of the most notable:

### 1. **Enron (2001)**
   - **Industry**: Energy/Utilities
   - **Reason**: Enron, once one of the largest energy companies in the world, collapsed due to widespread accounting fraud and corporate misconduct. The company used complex financial instruments and accounting loopholes to hide billions in debt, eventually leading to its bankruptcy. The scandal resulted in massive losses for investors and employees, and it led to reforms in corporate governance and accounting practices (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley Act).

### 2. **WorldCom (2002)**
   - **Industry**: Telecommunications
   - **Reason**: WorldCom, a major telecommunications provider, filed for bankruptcy after revealing that it had overstated its earnings by $11 billion. The company’s executives were involved in fraudulent accounting practices, and this led to one of the largest corporate bankruptcies in U.S. history at the time. The scandal also led to significant changes in corporate regulations.

### 3. **Lehman Brothers (2008)**
   - **Industry**: Financial Services
   - **Reason**: As mentioned earlier, Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in 2008 was one of the most significant financial collapses in history. The investment bank was heavily involved in subprime mortgage-backed securities and faced massive losses during the global financial crisis. Lehman’s collapse triggered a global financial meltdown, leading to a severe recession.

### 4. **Pan Am (1991)**
   - **Industry**: Aviation
   - **Reason**: Pan Am, one of the most iconic American airlines, went bankrupt in 1991 after years of financial struggles. Factors contributing to its collapse included rising fuel costs, competition from low-cost carriers, and the effects of the Lockerbie bombing in 1988, which had a lasting impact on the company’s finances and reputation.

### 5. **Kmart (2002)**
   - **Industry**: Retail
   - **Reason**: Kmart filed for bankruptcy in 2002 due to declining sales, increasing competition from Walmart and other big-box retailers, and poor management. The company struggled with its debt load and failed to adapt to changing consumer trends. After restructuring, Kmart emerged from bankruptcy in 2003, though it continued to face financial struggles in the following years.

### 6. **Circuit City (2008)**
   - **Industry**: Electronics Retail
   - **Reason**: Circuit City, once one of the largest consumer electronics retailers in the U.S., filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The company struggled with declining sales, intense competition from Best Buy and online retailers like Amazon, and poor management decisions. Circuit City ultimately closed all of its stores by 2009.

### 7. **MCI (2002)**
   - **Industry**: Telecommunications
   - **Reason**: MCI, previously known as WorldCom before its merger, filed for bankruptcy in 2002 after its role in the accounting fraud scandal became apparent. The company was forced to restructure its debt, and it eventually emerged from bankruptcy and was acquired by Verizon Communications in 2006.

### 8. **AltaVista (1990s-2000s)**
   - **Industry**: Internet/Search Engine
   - **Reason**: AltaVista was one of the first popular search engines on the internet, but it was overtaken by competitors like Google in the late 1990s. Despite being an early innovator, AltaVista struggled with ineffective leadership, poor strategic decisions, and an inability to adapt to changing market trends. It was acquired by Yahoo! in 2003, but it eventually faded into obscurity.

### 9. **Woolworths (1997)**
   - **Industry**: Retail
   - **Reason**: Woolworths (the American chain, not the UK one) was a staple of U.S. retail for many years. However, by the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company was in decline. It struggled to compete with more specialized retailers and big-box stores. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1997 and eventually transitioned to becoming Foot Locker, which still operates today.

### 10. **Delphi Automotive (2005)**
   - **Industry**: Automotive
   - **Reason**: Delphi, an automotive parts supplier and spin-off from General Motors, filed for bankruptcy in 2005 after facing declining sales, high debt levels, and competition from foreign manufacturers. The company’s bankruptcy was part of a larger trend affecting the American auto industry during this period. Delphi restructured its business and emerged from bankruptcy in 2009.

### 11. **Polaroid (2001)**
   - **Industry**: Photography
   - **Reason**: Polaroid, known for its instant cameras and film, failed to transition to digital photography in time. As digital cameras and smartphones gained popularity in the 1990s and early 2000s, Polaroid’s sales dropped sharply. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2001, and its brand was eventually acquired and relaunched under new ownership.

### 12. **GM (General Motors) (2009)**
   - **Industry**: Automotive
   - **Reason**: General Motors filed for bankruptcy in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis, declining vehicle sales, and massive debt. The company had been struggling for years with high labor costs, inefficiencies, and a failure to adapt to changing consumer preferences for fuel-efficient cars. It was rescued by the U.S. government and restructured into a leaner, more competitive entity.

### 13. **Bear Stearns (2008)**
   - **Industry**: Investment Banking
   - **Reason**: Bear Stearns, one of the largest investment banks in the U.S., collapsed in 2008 due to its exposure to mortgage-backed securities and the subprime mortgage crisis. The firm was forced to sell itself to JPMorgan Chase at a fraction of its former value, marking one of the early casualties of the financial crisis.

### 14. **Nortel Networks (2009)**
   - **Industry**: Telecommunications/Technology
   - **Reason**: Nortel, once a dominant player in the global telecommunications industry, filed for bankruptcy in 2009 after years of declining sales, management issues, and accounting scandals. The company’s decline was exacerbated by competition from companies like Cisco and Huawei. Nortel’s assets were sold off in pieces, and it no longer exists today.

These collapses reflect the dramatic shifts in technology, management, and market conditions during this period. Many of these companies failed to adapt to new technologies or business models, which ultimately led to their demise. Others were hit by external economic factors like the dot-com bubble burst, the 2008 financial crisis, or shifts in consumer preferences.
