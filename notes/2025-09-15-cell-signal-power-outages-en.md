Yes, it's very likely that your building has a **distributed antenna system (DAS)** or a **4G/5G signal booster (repeater)** installed to provide cellular coverage in underground areas like the parking lot (floors -1, -2, etc.).

### Why Does This Happen?
1. **Underground Areas Block Signals**
   - Basements and underground parking lots are typically shielded by thick concrete, steel, and other materials that block or weaken cellular signals from outside cell towers.
   - Without an internal signal distribution system, these areas would have **no signal at all**.

2. **Building Has a Signal Booster or DAS**
   - Many modern buildings install **signal repeaters** (small devices that amplify and rebroadcast cellular signals) or a **DAS** (a network of antennas connected to a central signal source).
   - These systems rely on **power** to function. When the building loses electricity, they **shut down**, causing the underground areas to lose signal.

3. **Why Upper Floors Still Have Signal**
   - Upper floors (ground level and above) usually get signal directly from nearby cell towers, so they are less affected by a power outage in the building.

### How to Confirm?
- **Check for Small Antennas or Boxes** in the parking lot (often mounted on walls or ceilings).
- **Ask Building Management** if they have a **cellular booster or DAS** installed.
- **Observe Signal Behavior** – If signal returns when power is restored, it confirms the system is power-dependent.

### Possible Solutions if This Bothers You
- If frequent outages are an issue, suggest to management that they install a **battery backup (UPS)** for the signal booster.
- Use **Wi-Fi calling** (if your phone and carrier support it) as a backup when cellular fails.
