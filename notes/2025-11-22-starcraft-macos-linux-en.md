That is a great question! The good news is that you absolutely can play the classic game on both **macOS** and **Ubuntu/Linux** in 2025, but you will be using the modern release, **StarCraft: Remastered**.

Here is a breakdown of the best ways to get back into the game on your current operating systems:

---

## 🍎 For macOS (The Simplest Way)

The original *StarCraft* game was officially re-released as **StarCraft: Remastered**, and the best part is that Blizzard provides a **native macOS version**.

1.  **Download Battle.net:** Go to the official Blizzard website and download the **Battle.net Desktop App for Mac**.
2.  **Install the Game:** Open the Battle.net app, log in (or create a free account), and find **StarCraft: Remastered** in your library.
3.  **Play:** Install the game. The original *StarCraft* and its expansion, *Brood War*, are actually available to play **for free** within the Remastered client, even without purchasing the paid HD graphics upgrade. You can switch between the old-school 1998 look and the Remastered 4K look.
    * *Note: On newer Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs, it runs through Apple's Rosetta 2 translation layer, but generally performs very well.*

## 🐧 For Ubuntu/Linux (Using Compatibility Layers)

Since Blizzard does not offer a native Linux version, you will use a Windows compatibility layer like **Wine** or one of its wrappers (**Lutris** or **Steam/Proton**). This is a well-established method for gaming on Linux.

### Option 1: Using Lutris (Recommended for Battle.net)

**Lutris** is a dedicated game manager for Linux that simplifies the process of running Windows games.

1.  **Install Lutris:** Install the Lutris client using your Ubuntu package manager.
2.  **Use the StarCraft Script:** Search for **StarCraft: Remastered** on the Lutris website. Lutris provides pre-configured installation scripts that handle the Battle.net client and Wine setup automatically.
3.  **Install and Play:** Run the script, and you can install and launch the game directly from the Lutris client.

### Option 2: Using Steam/Proton (Simple for General Users)

If you already use Steam, this can also be very simple:

1.  **Install Steam:** Install Steam on your Ubuntu system.
2.  **Install Battle.net via Steam:**
    * Download the **Windows Battle.net-Setup.exe** file from Blizzard's website.
    * In the Steam client, go to **Games** > **Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library...** and select the `.exe` file.
    * Right-click the new Battle.net entry in your Steam Library, go to **Properties** > **Compatibility**, and check **"Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool,"** selecting **Proton Experimental**.
    * Run it, install Battle.net, and then install StarCraft: Remastered through the Battle.net app.

**In summary:**

| OS | Method | Difficulty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **macOS** | **Native Battle.net App** | Very Easy |
| **Ubuntu** | **Lutris** or **Steam/Proton** (using Wine) | Medium |
