title: Workflow Ergonomics for AI Coding Efficiency
translated: false
type: note
---

You’re onto something very deep here — it’s not just about hardware, it’s about **workflow ergonomics**. Stock/quant traders figured this out decades ago: when you’re monitoring many signals simultaneously, switching costs kill you. So instead of “switching windows,” they create **persistent visual spaces** where each task always lives.

Let’s translate that idea to coding + AI practice.

---

## 1. Why Traders Use Many Monitors

* **Zero switching cost**: Each monitor is “pinned” to one feed (charts, order book, chat with risk desk). Eyes move, but windows never swap.
* **Spatial memory**: They know exactly where to look for signal A vs signal B. That’s faster than alt-tabbing or dragging windows.
* **Parallel awareness**: They can “see” multiple things evolving at once (price action here, risk alerts there) without breaking flow.

This is the philosophy you’re pointing at — and it applies perfectly to AI-assisted coding.

## 2. Applying It to AI + Code Agents

Think of your workspace as a **trading floor for code + AI**:

* **Monitor 1 (Left):** Your active coding IDE (VSCode, IntelliJ).
* **Monitor 2 (Right):** Dedicated Claude Code / Codex chat session for *this project only*. Never reused for other things.
* **Monitor 3 (Top Left):** Logs/terminal sessions running your agents.
* **Monitor 4 (Top Right):** Cloud orchestration dashboard (your router, task queues, OpenAI/Claude job trackers).
* **Monitor 5 (Bottom Left):** Research/reading window (papers, API docs).
* **Monitor 6 (Bottom Right):** Another AI session reserved for brainstorming, reflection, or meta-thinking.

Now, like a trader, **you never alt-tab to change purpose**. Each monitor = one role. After some practice, your brain learns:

* “Coding is always bottom left.”
* “Logs are always top right.”
* “Claude Code for debugging is always right screen.”

That spatial anchoring makes context-switching nearly costless.

## 3. Two Laptops vs Multi-Monitors

* **Two laptops:** Strong *project isolation*. Good when projects must never bleed (Project A vs Project B).
* **Multi-monitor rig:** Strong *role isolation*. Good when one project needs many roles in parallel (coding + logs + AI + research).

Traders often need **both**: different desks for different portfolios, and multi-monitors for different feeds. Same for us:

* Use **laptops for projects**,
* Use **monitors for roles** within each project.

## 4. How This Helps AI Coding Practice

* Your AI “agents” become like trading bots. Each one gets a dedicated screen, so you see their outputs evolving in real time.
* You code while your AI workers debug, summarize, or search on other monitors — without breaking flow.
* Over time, you’ll develop a **spatial workflow**: “if I want logs, glance top right. If I want AI brainstorm, glance bottom right.” No clicks needed.

This makes you more like a **quant developer on a trading floor**, where AIs are your junior traders.

✅ So your instinct is right: the key lesson from traders is **minimizing switch cost by hard-wiring tasks to physical spaces**.

Do you want me to sketch a **mock layout diagram** (like a trader’s six-monitor desk, but labeled for AI coding agents)? That could make this even clearer.
