Framework Computer has garnered significant praise for its innovative approach to laptops, particularly for its focus on repairability, upgradeability, and modularity. Here’s a balanced look at why it’s considered great by many, along with some caveats, based on available information:

### Why Framework is Considered Great:
1. **Unprecedented Repairability and Upgradeability**:
   - Framework laptops, like the Framework Laptop 13 and 16, are designed to be user-repairable and upgradeable, a rarity in modern laptops. Nearly every component—RAM, storage, battery, motherboard, ports, and even the keyboard—can be swapped out or upgraded with minimal technical expertise. This aligns with the "right to repair" movement and reduces e-waste.[](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/framework-laptop)[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/framework-laptop/)
   - The company provides detailed guides and a marketplace for replacement parts, with QR codes on components linking to repair instructions, making the process accessible even for less experienced users.[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/framework-laptop/)[](https://www.theverge.com/23270191/framework-laptop-12th-gen-2022-review)

2. **Modular Design**:
   - Framework’s modular port system (Expansion Cards) allows users to customize ports (e.g., USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, or storage) on the fly, offering flexibility not found in most laptops.[](https://www.theverge.com/22587205/framework-laptop-review)[](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/framework-laptop-review-a-functional-and-futureproof-13-inches/)
   - The Framework Laptop 16 takes modularity further with hot-swappable keyboards, touchpads, and even a discrete GPU module, allowing it to transform from a work laptop to a gaming machine.[](https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review)

3. **Sustainability Focus**:
   - Framework emphasizes eco-friendly design, using recycled materials (e.g., 50% recycled aluminum) and packaging that’s 100% recyclable. Its repairable and upgradeable nature extends device lifespan, reducing the need for frequent replacements.[](https://thesmashy.medium.com/framework-13-laptop-3-month-review-481463bf9edd)[](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/23/review-frameworks-latest-modular-laptop-is-one-i-could-stick-with-for-years/)
   - Reviewers note that this approach makes Framework a leader in sustainable computing, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.[](https://www.popsci.com/reviews/framework-laptop-review/)

4. **Performance**:
   - Recent models, especially those with AMD Ryzen AI 300 series chips (e.g., Ryzen AI 9 HX 370), offer impressive performance for a thin-and-light laptop, with benchmarks like Geekbench 6 scores of 2,866 (single-core) and 12,153 (multi-core), competitive with high-end ultraportables.[](https://lifehacker.com/tech/framework-laptop-13-review)[](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/review-ryzen-ai-cpu-makes-this-the-fastest-the-framework-laptop-13-has-ever-been/)
   - The Framework Laptop 16’s AMD Radeon RX 7700S GPU handles 1080p gaming decently, making it versatile for light gaming or creative workloads.[](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/review-frameworks-laptop-16-is-unique-laudable-fascinating-and-flawed/)

5. **Build Quality and User Experience**:
   - The Framework Laptop 13 has evolved into a polished product with a sturdy CNC aluminum chassis, a comfortable keyboard, and a smooth trackpad. The 3:2, 2.8K matte display is praised for minimal glare and sharp visuals.[](https://www.wired.com/review/framework-laptop-13-2023/)[](https://gizmodo.com/framework-laptop-13-review-wait-did-i-actually-have-fun-with-a-pc-2000590685)
   - Users report a sense of ownership and satisfaction from customizing or assembling their laptop, likening it to building a Lego set.[](https://gizmodo.com/framework-laptop-13-review-wait-did-i-actually-have-fun-with-a-pc-2000590685)

6. **Community and Industry Support**:
   - Framework has a strong community following, with users on platforms like Reddit and X praising its repairability and upgradeability. For example, posts on X describe Framework laptops as “the spiritual successors to the ThinkPads of old” and “the future of laptops.”
   - It’s received accolades like TIME’s Best Inventions of 2023 for the Framework Laptop 16 and a 10/10 repairability score from iFixit.[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/framework-laptop/)

### Potential Drawbacks:
1. **Battery Life**:
   - Battery life is a consistent weak point, often not lasting a full workday (around 6-8 hours for light tasks). The AMD Ryzen AI models, while powerful, further reduce battery life compared to Intel versions.[](https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/framework/laptop-13-2022)[](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/review-ryzen-ai-cpu-makes-this-the-fastest-the-framework-laptop-13-has-ever-been/)
   - Framework has introduced a larger 61Wh battery, but it still lags behind competitors like the Microsoft Surface Laptop 5.[](https://www.rtings.com/laptop/reviews/framework/laptop-13-2022)

2. **Not Ideal for Heavy Graphics Work**:
   - The Framework Laptop 13 relies on integrated graphics (e.g., Intel Iris Xe or Radeon 890M), making it unsuitable for demanding tasks like video editing or high-end gaming. The Framework Laptop 16’s discrete GPU helps, but it’s still not on par with dedicated gaming laptops.[](https://www.wired.com/review/framework-laptop-13-2023/)[](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/review-frameworks-laptop-16-is-unique-laudable-fascinating-and-flawed/)

3. **Price Premium**:
   - Starting at $819 for the base DIY model, Framework laptops are not the cheapest, and higher-end configurations (e.g., $1,680 for a Ryzen AI setup) can feel expensive compared to laptops with similar specs. However, the long-term value of upgrades is a counterpoint.[](https://gizmodo.com/framework-laptop-13-review-wait-did-i-actually-have-fun-with-a-pc-2000590685)[](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/23/review-frameworks-latest-modular-laptop-is-one-i-could-stick-with-for-years/)

4. **Minor Hardware Quirks**:
   - Some reviewers noted issues like fan noise under heavy loads, expansion card removal difficulties, or occasional firmware bugs (e.g., blue screens on the Framework 16). Framework has been proactive in addressing these with fixes and replacements.[](https://lifehacker.com/tech/framework-laptop-13-review)[](https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review)[](https://frame.work/blog/framework-laptop-16-reviews-are-live)

5. **Dependency on Framework’s Ecosystem**:
   - While many parts (e.g., RAM, SSD) are standard, some components like mainboards are Framework-specific, meaning long-term upgrades rely on the company’s continued support. This could be a risk if Framework faces financial challenges.[](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/23/review-frameworks-latest-modular-laptop-is-one-i-could-stick-with-for-years/)

### Conclusion:
Framework Computer is widely regarded as great, particularly for tech enthusiasts, environmentally conscious consumers, and those who value repairability and customization. Its modular design, solid performance, and commitment to sustainability set it apart in a market dominated by less repairable devices. However, its battery life, higher price point, and limitations for graphics-intensive tasks make it less ideal for some users, like gamers or video editors. If you prioritize longevity, flexibility, and a hands-on approach to tech, Framework is an excellent choice, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution.
