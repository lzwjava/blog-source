Dr. Emanuel E. García (often referred to as Manny García) is a New Zealand-based psychiatrist and physician of Sephardic heritage. He worked as a consultant psychiatrist for Hutt Valley District Health Board but was temporarily suspended in late 2021 by the Medical Council of New Zealand amid investigations into his public anti-vaccination views on COVID-19. He is the founder of NZDSOS (New Zealand Doctors Speaking Out with Science), a group advocating for medical freedom, informed consent, and open debate on public health issues during the pandemic. García has been vocal in criticizing what he sees as overreach in COVID policies, emphasizing principles like "do no harm" and individual rights.

### Key Comments on COVID-19 and Vaccines
García's statements focus on concerns about vaccine safety, government mandates, fear-driven policies, and institutional suppression of dissent. Here's a summary of his main points, drawn from his public videos, speeches, and writings:

- **Vaccine Rollout Concerns**: In a June 2021 video declaration, he stated: "I am gravely concerned about the roll out of the Pfizer vaccine." He argued that the rushed deployment lacked sufficient long-term safety data and could harm vulnerable populations, urging caution and more transparent risk-benefit analysis.

- **Fear and Mandates**: In a 2024 conference address (published January 2025), he described fear as the "fulcrum" enabling lockdowns, vaccine mandates, and a "vax apartheid" in New Zealand: "Fear was the fulcrum that allowed the government here in New Zealand and institutions like the Medical Council to ensure submission to their directives." He criticized the Medical Council for silencing doctors who questioned the agenda, calling it a "witch hunt" that subverted medical ethics.

- **Medical Principles and Treatment**: García advocates for individualized care over blanket policies, stressing: "Who can argue with informed consent? With not doing harm? With individualized treatment? With prevention? With tending to the ill? With the absolute right of people to refuse any medical intervention should they decide against it?" He believes the pandemic response ignored early treatment options and prioritized experimental vaccines.

- **Broader Critique**: He views the COVID era as exposing corruption in institutions and Big Pharma: "A remarkably positive feature of the covid saga has been a rending of the veils behind which our once-venerable institutions have operated – and an opening up of new vistas in medical care outside the Big Pharma stranglehold." In interviews, he has called for non-compliance against future overreaches and building community support networks.

His views led to professional repercussions, including his suspension alongside other doctors for promoting anti-vax messages. Supporters see him as a whistleblower; critics argue his stance endangered public health, especially for mental health patients reliant on psychiatric trust. Recent discussions (as of 2025) involve him questioning ongoing Medical Council actions and vaccine self-amplifying RNA tech.
