You're spot on with your observations about the trade-offs between low-code/PaaS platforms (like Parse or Firebase, which lean into BaaS—Backend as a Service) and the broader IaaS-heavy ecosystems of AWS, GCP, and Azure. These differences in abstraction levels, control, and scope directly explain the popularity gap. I'll break it down step by step, building on your points about limited APIs, client-side bloat, and customization hurdles, while drawing in some broader context on why the "big three" dominate.

### Why PaaS/BaaS Platforms Like Parse or Firebase Aren't as Dominant
AWS, GCP, and Azure hold massive market share (AWS alone at ~32% globally as of mid-2025, followed by Azure at ~22% and GCP at ~11%) because they're not just PaaS—they're full-spectrum clouds blending IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and specialized services. This makes them go-to for enterprises handling complex, high-stakes workloads (e.g., Netflix on AWS for streaming scale, or LinkedIn on Azure for enterprise data integration). In contrast:

- **Niche Focus vs. Comprehensive Coverage**: Firebase shines for rapid mobile/web prototyping (e.g., real-time chat apps via Firestore), and Parse (now open-source post-Facebook acquisition) was great for quick backend hooks. But they're optimized for *specific* dev patterns, like client-heavy apps. They lack the 200+ services in AWS (from ML to IoT) or Azure's 600+ (deep Microsoft ecosystem ties). If your app needs advanced networking, custom databases beyond NoSQL, or hybrid on-prem integration, you outgrow them fast. Result: They're popular in startups/SMEs (Firebase powers ~5% of tech sites), but enterprises stick with the big clouds for "everything under one roof."

- **Enterprise Adoption and Ecosystem Lock**: Big clouds have won the trust war through maturity—launched earlier (AWS in 2006, Azure in 2010) and backed by trillion-dollar companies. They offer free tiers, global compliance (e.g., GDPR/HIPAA baked in), and massive communities (AWS has 26x more Stack Overflow mentions than Firebase). PaaS like Firebase feels "Google-first," which limits appeal outside Android/web devs, while Parse faded after 2017 due to no sustained backing.

- **Scalability Ceiling for Growth**: As you noted, these platforms accelerate *initial* dev but hit walls. Firebase's Blaze plan scales "pay-as-you-go," but for massive loads (e.g., 1M+ concurrent users), it requires awkward workarounds like sharding data manually—unlike AWS's auto-scaling EC2 or Lambda, which handle petabyte-scale without rethinking your architecture.

### Key Downsides of PaaS/BaaS (Echoing Your Points)
Your example of Parse's limited APIs forcing client-side duplication is classic—it's a BaaS hallmark. These platforms abstract the backend to speed things up, but that convenience creates friction:

- **Limited APIs and Client-Side Overload**: Parse/Firebase push logic to the client (e.g., queries via SDKs), leading to redundant code across iOS/Android/web. Cloud Code/Functions exist, but as you said, they're indirect—trigger-based, not full servers. This bloats apps (e.g., handling auth/offline sync client-side) and raises security risks (exposing queries to tampering). In contrast, AWS AppSync or Azure Functions let you build direct, serverless APIs with fine-grained control.

- **Customization Constraints**: Abstraction is the double-edged sword you mentioned. PaaS hides infrastructure for ease (no server provisioning), but you can't tweak OS-level stuff, middleware, or non-standard integrations. Want a custom MySQL setup with exotic plugins? Firebase says no—stick to Firestore. AWS/GCP give "bare metal" vibes via EC2/VMs, where you spin up servers, install whatever, and customize endlessly. This flexibility suits legacy migrations or unique needs, but yes, it trades convenience for ops overhead.

- **Vendor Lock-In and Portability Nightmares**: Tied to one provider's ecosystem (e.g., Firebase's Google auth/tools), migrating is painful—rewrite SDK calls, refactor data models. Big clouds have lock-in too, but their standards-based IaaS (e.g., S3-compatible storage) makes multi-cloud easier.

- **Security and Compliance Gaps**: Client-heavy designs amplify risks (e.g., API keys in apps). PaaS providers handle infra security, but you lose granular control over encryption, access policies, or audits—critical for enterprises. Plus, limited app stacks mean no support for every language/framework.

- **Cost Surprises at Scale**: Free tiers lure you in, but unpredictable billing (e.g., Firebase charges per read/write) can explode. IaaS lets you optimize (spot instances save 90%), though it requires expertise.

### IaaS Strengths (and Why It Fits Your "Bare Metal" Analogy)
You're right—the big clouds excel here by democratizing "bare metal" without actual hardware. Launch a VM, slap on MySQL/Apache, and you're off—no abstractions blocking you. It's not like Twilio's hyper-specific SMS APIs; it's modular building blocks for any stack. The downside? You manage patching/scaling/security, which PaaS offloads. But for teams wanting control (e.g., custom kernels for fintech), it's liberating. Many use a hybrid: PaaS for quick prototypes, IaaS for production.

In short, PaaS/BaaS like Parse/Firebase democratize dev for speed but sacrifice depth, making them "popular enough" for indies—not empires. If your project's simple/real-time, start there; otherwise, the big clouds' flexibility wins out.
