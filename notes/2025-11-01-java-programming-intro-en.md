This outline is based on the standard syllabus for the National Higher Education Self-study Examination in China, specifically tailored for introductory Java programming. It covers the core concepts, structure, and assessment focus for the course in Guangdong province. The course emphasizes foundational programming skills using Java, including syntax, object-oriented principles, and basic application development.

## I. Course Nature and Objectives
- **Nature**: This is a foundational programming course focusing on object-oriented programming (OOP) using Java. Java is a platform-independent, secure, and versatile language ideal for network and application development.
- **Objectives**: 
  - Understand basic programming concepts and Java's features.
  - Master Java syntax, data types, control structures, and methods.
  - Develop skills in creating simple programs, handling data structures like arrays, and implementing OOP principles.
  - Prepare students for practical problem-solving through coding and debugging.

## II. Assessment Goals
- **Knowledge**: Grasp Java's development environment, basic syntax, and core libraries.
- **Skills**: Write, compile, and execute Java programs; design simple algorithms; use OOP for code organization.
- **Exam Format**: Closed-book, 100 points, 90 minutes. Includes multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, program reading, short answers, and programming questions.
- **Weighting**: Theoretical knowledge (40%), practical coding (60%).

- Static variables and methods.
- Visibility modifiers (public, private, etc.).
- Encapsulation of data fields.
- Passing objects as parameters.
- Arrays of objects.
- Class variable scope.
- The 'this' reference.

### Ninth Part: Inheritance and Polymorphism

## IV. Reference Textbook
- *Java Language Programming (Basics)*, 10th Edition, by Yong Liang (梁勇), Machinery Industry Press, ISBN: 9787111506904.

## V. Implementation Notes
- Focus on hands-on practice: Students should install JDK and use an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ for coding.
- Assessment emphasizes practical application; exams may require writing complete programs.
- Updates: Outlines may be revised periodically; check the Guangdong Education Exam Authority for the latest version.
