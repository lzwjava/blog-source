People love Linux and Ubuntu for a variety of reasons, and your preference for terminal and text-based operations is one of them. Here are some common reasons why users might prefer Linux distributions like Ubuntu:

1. **Customizability**: Linux offers a high degree of customization. Users can tweak almost every aspect of the operating system to suit their needs.

2. **Open Source**: Being open-source, Linux allows users to view, modify, and distribute the source code, which is appealing to those who value transparency and community collaboration.

3. **Security**: Linux is often considered more secure than other operating systems. Its user permission model and the fact that it is less targeted by malware contribute to this perception.

4. **Performance**: Linux can run efficiently on older hardware, making it a good choice for reviving old computers or running servers.

5. **Terminal and Command Line**: Many users, especially developers and system administrators, prefer using the command line for its efficiency and power. Linux provides a robust command-line interface that these users appreciate.

6. **Software Development**: Linux is widely used in development environments due to its support for a wide range of programming languages and development tools.

7. **Community Support**: There is a strong community around Linux distributions, providing support, documentation, and a wealth of online resources.

8. **No Licensing Costs**: Linux is free to use, which is a significant advantage for individuals and organizations looking to reduce software licensing costs.

While your preference for terminal-based workflows is a valid reason to love Ubuntu, it is just one of many factors that attract users to Linux. Different users might prioritize these aspects differently based on their specific needs and interests.
