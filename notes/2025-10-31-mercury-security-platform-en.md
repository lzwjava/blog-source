### Introduction to Mercury Security System (水星安防系统)

The Mercury Security System (水星安防系统) is a comprehensive management platform designed specifically for overseeing Mercury-brand network cameras (IPCs) and network video recorders (NVRs). Developed by Mercurycom, this software serves as a user-friendly client tool that enables both local and remote control of surveillance devices, making it ideal for home, small business, or professional security setups.

#### Key Features:
- **Device Management**: Easily configure and manage multiple IPCs and NVRs within a local network, including IP address assignments, batch modifications, and password recovery.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Supports live video previews, PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) controls, two-way audio intercom, snapshot capture, and recording directly from connected cameras.
- **Storage and Playback**: Set up flexible storage schedules, schedule recordings, and access playback for archived footage—either locally or remotely via cloud integration.
- **Remote Access**: Log in with a Mercury account for on-the-go viewing and control through the companion mobile app (available on iOS and Android), ensuring seamless surveillance from anywhere.
- **Compatibility**: Built for Windows PCs as the primary client (latest version: 4.0.5.46), with mobile versions offering similar core functions. It supports H.265 encoding for efficient video compression and high-resolution feeds up to 4K.

This system emphasizes reliability, ease of use, and scalability, allowing users to expand from basic setups (e.g., 4-channel NVRs) to advanced multi-camera networks (up to 16+ channels). It's particularly popular in China for its cost-effective integration with affordable Mercury hardware, providing robust features without complex setups.
