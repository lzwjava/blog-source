title: 'Top 100 Maven Java Packages of 2025: Challenges in Ranking by Downloads and
  Impact'
translated: false
---

Compiling a precise list of the top 100 Maven Java packages for 2025, ranked by downloads and impact, is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive, up-to-date public data on Maven Central's download statistics and usage metrics. Maven Central does not natively provide detailed public download counts or impact metrics (e.g., dependent projects or usage in open-source repositories), and while some tools like Nexus Repository Manager offer limited statistics, they are often restricted to specific artifacts or lack granular, real-time data. Additionally, impact is a subjective metric, often inferred from factors like the number of dependent projects, GitHub stars, or community adoption, which further complicates ranking.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960511/maven-artifact-how-to-obtain-all-statistics-not-only-download-on-maven-centra)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/3u9sf0/why_no_public_stats_on_maven/)

However, based on available information from sources like Maven Repository, community discussions, and industry trends up to 2025, I can provide a curated list of some of the most popular and impactful Maven Java packages. This list prioritizes libraries and frameworks that are widely downloaded (based on historical data and repository prominence) and have significant impact (based on their use in open-source projects, enterprise adoption, and developer surveys). Since a full list of 100 packages with exact rankings is not feasible without proprietary data, I’ll provide a selection of 50 key packages, grouped by category, with explanations of their prominence. If you need the remaining 50 or a specific subset, I can refine the list further.[](https://mvnrepository.com/popular)[](https://mvnrepository.com/)[](https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/18463-java-in-2023-version-releases-popularity-and-future-trends)

### Methodology
- **Downloads**: Inferred from Maven Repository listings, where packages like `junit`, `slf4j`, and `commons-lang` consistently appear as top artifacts, and from community discussions noting high download counts for libraries like `guava` and `spring`.[](https://mvnrepository.com/popular)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/3u9sf0/why_no_public_stats_on_maven/)
- **Impact**: Assessed via usage in open-source projects (e.g., GitHub dependencies), developer surveys (e.g., JetBrains’ 2023 report noting Spring and Maven’s dominance), and their role in critical Java ecosystems (e.g., logging, testing, web frameworks).[](https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/18463-java-in-2023-version-releases-popularity-and-future-trends)
- **Sources**: Maven Repository, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and developer blogs provide partial insights into popular artifacts.[](https://mvnrepository.com/popular)[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960511/maven-artifact-how-to-obtain-all-statistics-not-only-download-on-maven-centra)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/3u9sf0/why_no_public_stats_on_maven/)
- **Limitations**: Without access to real-time or historical data, rankings are approximate, based on trends and patterns up to 2025. Closed-source usage and private repositories are not accounted for.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/3u9sf0/why_no_public_stats_on_maven/)

### Notes
- **Ranking Approximation**: Packages like `junit`, `slf4j-api`, and `spring-webmvc` rank high due to their universal adoption, inferred from Maven Repository prominence and developer surveys. Others, like `lombok` and `okhttp`, are lower but rising due to modern trends.[](https://mvnrepository.com/popular)[](https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/18463-java-in-2023-version-releases-popularity-and-future-trends)
- **Impact Metrics**: Libraries like `spring-core` and `hibernate-core` have high impact due to their role in enterprise ecosystems, while `guava` and `commons-lang3` are impactful for their utility across projects.
- **Missing Data**: Exact download counts are unavailable, and rankings rely on qualitative trends. For precise data, tools like Nexus or Libraries.io could provide insights but require access.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960511/maven-artifact-how-to-obtain-all-statistics-not-only-download-on-maven-centra)[](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/maven-plugin)
- **Extending to 100**: Additional packages could include niche libraries (e.g., `aws-sdk-java`, `selenium-java`) or plugins (e.g., `jetty-maven-plugin`), but their ranking would be speculative without data.[](https://www.tabnine.com/blog/8-essential-maven-plugins-beyond-the-core/)

### Recommendations
- To explore exact download stats, check Maven Central via a repository manager like Nexus or use tools like Libraries.io for dependency graphs.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57960511/maven-artifact-how-to-obtain-all-statistics-not-only-download-on-maven-centra)[](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/maven-plugin)
- For real-time trends, monitor GitHub repositories or Stack Overflow tags for library usage.
- If you need the next 50 packages or a specific category (e.g., security, cloud), let me know, and I can prioritize based on your requirements.
