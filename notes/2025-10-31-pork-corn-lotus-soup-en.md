### Pork Bone, Corn, and Lotus Root Soup

This is a classic Chinese nourishing soup with a clear, sweet, and savory flavor, perfect for autumn and winter tonics. The ingredients are simple, and the method is straightforward. Here's a recipe for 4-6 servings.

#### **Main Ingredients**
- Pork bones (marrow bones or ribs): 800g–1kg (with some meat for better flavor)
- Corn: 2–3 ears (cut into large segments)
- Lotus root: 500g (peeled and cut into thick slices or rolls)
- Ginger: 3–4 slices (lightly smashed)
- Red dates: 6–8 pieces (pitted, optional, for added sweetness)
- Goji berries: 1 small handful (about 10g, add later, optional)

#### **Seasonings**
- Salt: To taste (add at the end)
- Shaoxing wine: 1 tablespoon (for removing impurities)
- Water: 2.5–3 liters

#### **Steps**

1. **Blanch the Pork Bones (Key Step to Remove Impurities)**  
   - Rinse the pork bones under cold water. Place in a pot with cold water, add 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine and 2 slices of ginger. Bring to a boil over high heat and skim off the foam.  
   - Boil for 2–3 minutes, then remove and rinse under warm water to clean off any remaining blood and debris.

2. **Prepare Ingredients**  
   - Wash the corn and cut into 3–4cm segments.  
   - Peel the lotus root and cut into 1cm-thick roll cuts; soak in water to prevent browning.  
   - Slice the ginger and set aside.

3. **Simmer the Soup**  
   - In a clay pot or pressure cooker, add the blanched pork bones, corn segments, lotus root pieces, ginger slices, and red dates.  
   - Pour in 2.5–3 liters of cold water (enough to cover the ingredients by 2–3cm).  
   - **Bring to a boil over high heat**, then **reduce to low heat and simmer**:  
     - Regular pot: 2–2.5 hours  
     - Pressure cooker: 40–50 minutes (after pressure builds)

4. **Season and Serve**  
   - Simmer until the soup turns milky white and the corn and lotus root are tender and flavorful.  
   - Add goji berries in the last 10 minutes.  
   - Season with salt just before serving (don't add too early to avoid toughening the meat).  
   - Optional: Sprinkle with a pinch of white pepper or chopped green onions for extra aroma.

#### **Tips**
- **Milky Soup Color**: Blanch thoroughly + simmer on low heat + crack the bones slightly to release marrow.  
- **Prevent Lotus Root Browning**: Soak slices immediately in water, or add a few drops of white vinegar.  
- **For Richer Flavor**: Add 1–2 carrots or a few shiitake mushrooms.  
- **Rice Cooker/Slow Cooker**: Use the "soup" setting for 3–4 hours.  
- **Reduce Oil**: After cooking, refrigerate and skim off the solidified fat layer for a lighter soup.
