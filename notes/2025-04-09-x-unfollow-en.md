Yes, there are tools available that can help you unsubscribe (or mass unfollow) accounts on Twitter/X in batches, though X itself does not offer a built-in feature for this. Since "unsubscribe batchly" likely refers to unfollowing multiple accounts at once, here are some options based on available tools:

1. **Circleboom**: This is a popular Twitter management tool that allows you to mass unfollow accounts efficiently. You can filter accounts (e.g., inactive, fake, or non-followers) and unfollow them in batches. It’s web-based and also has an iOS app, though some features may require a subscription after a free trial or limited use.

2. **X (Twitter) Mass Unfollow Chrome Extension**: Available on the Chrome Web Store, this extension lets you unfollow all accounts or just those not following you back from your "Following" page on X. It’s free, configurable (e.g., exclude certain users), and works directly in your browser, but it’s limited to Chrome users.

3. **iUnfollow**: A web-based tool that syncs with your X account and allows you to unfollow up to 50 accounts per day for free. It’s simple to use and can target non-followers, with premium options for more advanced features.

4. **Tweepi**: This tool offers a free tier where you can unfollow up to 100 accounts daily. It helps you identify inactive or irrelevant accounts and batch unfollow them through an easy interface.

5. **Audiense Connect**: Another free option (with limits), this tool lets you mass unfollow by switching to "Follow Mode" on its community wall and clicking to remove accounts. It’s more manual but stays within X’s limits.

### Important Notes:
- **Safety**: Manual unfollowing (one-by-one via your X "Following" tab) is the safest method to avoid violating X’s automation rules, which could lead to account restrictions or suspension. Third-party tools carry some risk, so use trusted ones (like those listed) and avoid aggressive unfollowing (e.g., thousands at once).
- **Limits**: X imposes a technical limit of around 1,000 unfollows per day, though exceeding this or unfollowing too quickly might flag your account. Tools like Circleboom and Audiense respect these limits better than some extensions.
- **Cost**: Many tools offer free tiers with restrictions (e.g., 50-100 unfollows/day), while full batch features might require a paid plan.

If you’re looking for a free, simple solution, the **X Mass Unfollow Chrome Extension** or **iUnfollow’s free tier** might be your best starting points. For more advanced batch management, **Circleboom** is widely recommended, though you’d need to check its current pricing for full access. Always authorize third-party tools cautiously and review their permissions to protect your account. Would you like me to search for the latest updates on any of these tools?
