title: Rebase Root Commit Essentials Guide

`git rebase --root` is a special form of rebase that lets you rewrite the **very first commit** of your repository. Normally, `git rebase` needs a parent commit to rebase onto, but the `--root` option treats the root commit (the first commit with no parent) as if it were being rebased too.

Here’s how it works in practice:

### 1. Standard rebase vs. root rebase

* **Normal `git rebase`**: You reapply commits on top of another branch or commit, changing history after a chosen base.
* **`git rebase --root`**: Instead of starting after the root, it rewrites the root itself. You can split it, squash it with subsequent commits, or even completely replace it.

### 2. Typical use cases

* **Editing the first commit message**
  If you want to rewrite your project’s very first commit message, you can run:

  ```bash
  git rebase --root -i
  ```

  and change `pick` to `reword` for the first commit.

* **Squashing the root with later commits**
  For example, if your first commit was just scaffolding (like a `README`), you can squash it into the next commit to clean up history.

* **Splitting the root commit**
  If your first commit contained too much (e.g., entire project code dump), you can split it into multiple logical commits during an interactive rebase.

### 3. What happens internally

* Git creates a temporary “fake” parent commit for the root commit so that it can apply rebase operations starting from scratch.
* Each commit is replayed (rebased) as if the repository began differently.
* You’re essentially rewriting the foundation of your repo’s history.

### 4. Example workflow

```bash
git rebase --root -i
```

You’ll get an editor like this:

```
pick a1b2c3d Initial commit
pick d4e5f6g Add feature A
pick h7i8j9k Add feature B
```

From here you can:

* Change `pick` to `reword` for the root commit → change its message.
* Change `pick` to `squash` → merge root with next commit.
* Reorder or split as needed.

### ⚠️ Important note

`git rebase --root` **rewrites history**, so it should only be done on branches that haven’t been pushed/shared, or you must force-push afterward. On shared branches, it can cause confusion and conflicts for collaborators.

Would you like me to also show you a concrete **before-and-after history example** (with commit hashes) so you can see exactly how `git rebase --root` changes the log?
