The message forwarding function in Microsoft Teams, which allows users to forward messages in chats (including 1:1, group, and meeting chats), was first introduced for targeted release customers in late November 2023. It became generally available to all users in early 2024, with rollout starting in mid-January for standard release on desktop, web, and mobile platforms.

Users can forward a message by right-clicking it (or tapping the ellipsis menu on mobile) and selecting "Forward," then choosing the destination chat and optionally adding context.

Later enhancements include:
- Forwarding messages to and from channels: Introduced in January 2025.
- Forwarding messages with Loop components and app cards: Also added in January 2025, with further app card support in April 2025.
