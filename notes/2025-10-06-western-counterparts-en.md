Yes, there are plenty of people in the West—particularly in the US and UK—who share similarities with Fang Shimin (Fang Zhouzi): individuals with scientific or academic backgrounds who act as vocal skeptics, debunkers of pseudoscience, fraud, and quackery, often through writing, blogging, or public advocacy. They tend to focus on exposing flaws in mainstream claims, alternative medicine scams, or academic misconduct, much like Fang's work in China. However, the Western context often involves less personal risk (no arrests for blogging), and their "obsessions" with nature or personal hobbies vary—few match Fang's daily wildflower ritual exactly, but some channel similar energies into mindfulness, art, or environmentalism.

A few notable examples:
- **Michael Shermer**: A former cyclist and psychologist with a master's in experimental psychology, he's the founding publisher of *Skeptic* magazine and author of books like *Why People Believe Weird Things*. Like Fang, he's relentlessly debunked pseudoscience (e.g., creationism, UFOs, Holocaust denial) and academic fraud, often facing backlash from those he calls out. He lives in California and has a personal interest in human resilience and exploration, though not specifically flowers—more like stargazing and history.
- **Ben Goldacre**: A British physician and science writer (MD from Oxford), known for his *Bad Science* column and book, where he dismantles pharma hype, homeopathy, and nutrition myths with data-driven takedowns. He's obsessive about evidence-based medicine, much like Fang's health skepticism, and advocates for transparency in research. His "care for life" side shows in public health campaigns; he gardens casually but shares more about books and policy than blooms.
- **The Data Colada team** (Uri Simonsohn, Leif Nelson, and Joseph Simmons): A group of US psychologists and statisticians who've become modern "fraud busters," exposing data manipulation in high-profile papers (e.g., leading to the 2023 resignation of Stanford's president over falsified research). They're not solo bloggers like Fang but collaborative watchdogs using stats to uncover misconduct. No flower posts, but their work emphasizes ethical science as a way to nurture reliable knowledge.
- **Ivan Oransky** (co-founder of Retraction Watch): A US journalist with a science writing background, he tracks global retractions due to fraud via a blog that's exposed thousands of cases. It's the Western equivalent of Fang's *New Threads* site—methodical, influential, and focused on integrity. His personal side is low-key; he's into running and family, not botany.

As for **Miles Mathis**, he's an interesting but not quite parallel figure. Born in Texas in 1964, he has a brief academic background in physics and astronomy (majored at UT Austin, graduated summa cum laude from Haverford College), but he dropped out of formal science paths to pursue art, poetry, and self-published essays. Unlike Fang, who's a mainstream biochemist debunking fringe claims, Mathis is a fringe theorist himself—challenging established physics (e.g., claiming errors in quantum mechanics or gravity models) in a way that's often labeled pseudoscience or conspiracy-adjacent by critics. He's based in the US (New Mexico) and shares his work on his website, with a following among alternative thinkers, but it's more provocative revisionism than skeptical fraud-hunting.

On the "obsessed with flowers" angle, Mathis doesn't seem to have that at all. As a painter and poet, he writes philosophically about nature's beauty (e.g., using it as a metaphor for art's allure or evolutionary drives), but there's no evidence of daily hikes, Twitter flower shares, or botanical volunteering like Fang's. His hobbies lean toward classical painting, historical analysis, and debunking *official* narratives (e.g., on pi or relativity), which gives him a contrarian vibe but flips Fang's role from watchdog to outlier.

In short, Western skeptics exist in droves and often blend intellectual rigor with personal passions, but Mathis is more of a creative disruptor than a direct match. If you're thinking of someone specific like him for the nature tie-in, folks like David Attenborough (naturalist with a science advocacy bent) come closer, though he's more broadcaster than debunker.
