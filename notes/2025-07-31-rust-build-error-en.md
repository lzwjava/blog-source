title: Fixing Rust Privacy Error and Streamlining Build
translated: false
type: note
---

From your previous messages, I understand you're encountering an issue with building and running a Rust project due to a privacy error (`E0603`) for the `run_simple` function in `simple.rs`. You’ve now asked about settling the `cargo build` and `cargo run` commands into `Cargo.toml` or exploring other methods to streamline the process. I’ll interpret this as wanting to configure your Rust project to simplify building and running, potentially automating or customizing the process, and I’ll also address the earlier error to ensure a complete solution.

### Addressing the Privacy Error
First, let’s resolve the `E0603` error (`function run_simple is private`) to ensure `cargo build` and `cargo run` work. Based on the error output:

- **Fix `simple.rs`**:
  Open `src/simple.rs` and make the `run_simple` function public by adding `pub`:
  ```rust
  pub fn run_simple() {
      // Your existing code, e.g.:
      println!("Hello from run_simple!");
  }
  ```

- **Verify `main.rs`**:
  Ensure `src/main.rs` correctly references the `simple` module:
  ```rust
  mod simple;

  fn main() {
      simple::run_simple();
  }
  ```

- **Clean and Rebuild**:
  To avoid stale build artifacts, clean the project and rebuild:
  ```bash
  cargo clean
  cargo build
  ```

- **Run**:
  If the build succeeds, run the program:
  ```bash
  cargo run
  ```

### Settling `cargo build` and `cargo run` into `Cargo.toml`
The phrase “settle down it into Cargo.toml” suggests you want to configure your project so that building and running is streamlined, perhaps by defining custom build or run behaviors in `Cargo.toml`. In Rust, `Cargo.toml` primarily configures project metadata, dependencies, and build settings, but it doesn’t directly embed commands like `cargo build` or `cargo run`. Instead, you can:

1. **Define Multiple Binaries** (if `simple.rs` is a separate executable):
   If `simple.rs` is meant to be a standalone binary (not a module used by `main.rs`), you can configure it in `Cargo.toml` under the `[[bin]]` section. For example:
   ```toml
   [package]
   name = "example"
   version = "0.1.0"
   edition = "2024"

   [[bin]]
   name = "main"
   path = "src/main.rs"

   [[bin]]
   name = "simple"
   path = "src/simple.rs"
   ```
   - This tells Cargo that your project has two binaries: one from `main.rs` (named `main`) and one from `simple.rs` (named `simple`).
   - Build both binaries:
     ```bash
     cargo build
     ```
   - Run a specific binary:
     ```bash
     cargo run --bin main
     cargo run --bin simple
     ```
   - Ensure `simple.rs` has a `main` function:
     ```rust
     pub fn run_simple() {
         println!("Hello from run_simple!");
     }

     fn main() {
         run_simple();
     }
     ```

2. **Fix the Edition Warning**:
   Your earlier output showed a warning about the `edition2024` feature being unnecessary. Update `Cargo.toml` to use the 2024 edition directly:
   ```toml
   [package]
   name = "example"
   version = "0.1.0"
   edition = "2024"
   ```
   Remove any `cargo-features = ["edition2024"]` line if present.

3. **Custom Build Scripts** (Advanced):
   If you want to automate specific build steps (e.g., running custom commands before or after `cargo build`), you can use a build script. Create a `build.rs` file in the project root:
   ```rust
   fn main() {
       println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=src/simple.rs");
       // Add custom build logic here, e.g., generating files
   }
   ```
   Reference it in `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [package]
   name = "example"
   version = "0.1.0"
   edition = "2024"
   build = "build.rs"
   ```
   This doesn’t replace `cargo build` but allows custom pre-build tasks. You’d still run `cargo build` and `cargo run` as usual.

### Alternative Methods to Streamline `cargo build` and `cargo run`
If your goal is to simplify or automate running these commands, here are other methods:

1. **Shell Aliases**:
   Create aliases in your shell configuration (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) to shorten commands:
   ```bash
   alias cb='cargo build'
   alias cr='cargo run'
   ```
   - Save and reload your shell:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - Then use:
     ```bash
     cb
     cr
     ```

2. **Makefile**:
   Create a `Makefile` in the project root to define shortcuts:
   ```makefile
   build:
   	cargo build

   run:
   	cargo run

   clean:
   	cargo clean

   all: build run
   ```
   - Run:
     ```bash
     make build
     make run
     make all
     ```

3. **Cargo Watch** (for Development):
   Use `cargo-watch` to automatically rebuild and run when files change:
   - Install:
     ```bash
     cargo install cargo-watch
     ```
   - Run:
     ```bash
     cargo watch -x run
     ```
   - This watches for changes in `src/` and re-runs `cargo run`.

4. **VS Code Tasks** (if using an IDE):
   If you use Visual Studio Code, create a `.vscode/tasks.json` file:
   ```json
   {
       "version": "2.0.0",
       "tasks": [
           {
               "label": "Build",
               "type": "shell",
               "command": "cargo build",
               "group": "build"
           },
           {
               "label": "Run",
               "type": "shell",
               "command": "cargo run",
               "group": "build"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
   - Run tasks via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` > “Tasks: Run Task”).

5. **Scripts in `Cargo.toml`** (Limited Support):
   Cargo doesn’t natively support script aliases in `Cargo.toml`, but you can use a tool like `cargo-xtask` or define scripts in a separate `scripts` directory and run them manually. For simplicity, stick with `Makefile` or shell aliases.

### Recommended Solution
- **Fix the Error**: Add `pub` to `run_simple` in `simple.rs` and verify `main.rs`.
- **Configure `Cargo.toml`**: Use `[[bin]]` sections if you need multiple binaries, or keep it simple with a single binary in `main.rs`.
- **Streamline Commands**: Use shell aliases or a `Makefile` for convenience during development.

### Example Setup
**`Cargo.toml`**:
```toml
[package]
name = "example"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"
```

**`src/simple.rs`**:
```rust
pub fn run_simple() {
    println!("Hello from run_simple!");
}
```

**`src/main.rs`**:
```rust
mod simple;

fn main() {
    simple::run_simple();
}
```

**`Makefile`** (optional):
```makefile
build:
	cargo build

run:
	cargo run
```

- Build and run:
  ```bash
  make build
  make run
  ```
  Or:
  ```bash
  cargo build
  cargo run
  ```

### Troubleshooting
- If the privacy error persists, share `src/simple.rs` and `src/main.rs` contents.
- If you meant something specific by “settle down into Cargo.toml” (e.g., custom run scripts or profiles), clarify, and I’ll tailor the solution.
- Check Rust version:
  ```bash
  rustc --version
  ```
  Ensure it’s 1.85 or later for `edition = "2024"`.
