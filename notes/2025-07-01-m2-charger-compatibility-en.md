title: Baseus 67W Charger Works with MacBook Air M2
translated: false
---

Yes, the MacBook Air M2 can accept a 67W GaN Lite charger from Baseus, and it should work effectively for charging, including fast charging. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Compatibility
- **MacBook Air M2 Charging Requirements**: The MacBook Air M2 (2022) supports fast charging with a 67W or 70W USB-C power adapter, achieving up to a 50% charge in about 30 minutes when used with a USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable or a compatible USB-C cable. It can also use lower-wattage chargers (e.g., 30W or 35W), but these won't provide fast charging.[](https://www.hollyland.com/blog/tips/can-you-charge-macbook-air-m2-with-usb-c)[](https://www.macworld.com/article/819644/m2-macbook-air-usb-c-67w-35w-dual-compact-charger.html)
- **Baseus 67W GaN Lite Charger**: This charger uses Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology, which provides efficient and compact charging. It delivers up to 65W via a single USB-C port (or 25W + 20W when using both USB-C ports) and supports Power Delivery (PD) 3.0 and Programmable Power Supply (PPS) protocols, which are compatible with Apple’s USB-C charging standards.[](https://eu.baseus.com/products/gan5-pro-flat-usb-c-wall-charger-65w)[](https://www.baseus.com/products/gan5-pro-flat-wall-charger-65w)
- **Voltage and Amperage**: The MacBook Air M2 typically charges at around 20V/3.35A for 67W fast charging. The Baseus 67W GaN Lite charger can dynamically adjust its output (e.g., 5V/3A, 9V/3A, 15V/3A, 20V/3.25A) to match the MacBook’s requirements, ensuring safe and efficient charging.[](https://eu.baseus.com/products/gan5-pro-flat-usb-c-wall-charger-65w)[](https://www.baseus.com/products/gan5-pro-flat-wall-charger-65w)

### Key Considerations
1. **Fast Charging**: The Baseus 67W GaN Lite charger can provide the necessary power (65W single-port output) to fast-charge the MacBook Air M2, closely matching Apple’s 67W or 70W adapters. While it’s 2W less than Apple’s 67W charger, this difference is negligible and won’t significantly impact charging speed.[](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/third-party-macbook-air-m2-fast-chargers.2368900/)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookair/comments/w6te4b/67w_charger_alternative/)
2. **Safety**: The Baseus charger includes multiple safety protections (over-voltage, over-current, over-temperature, short-circuit, etc.), which align with Apple’s USB-C Power Delivery standards, ensuring safe charging without risking damage to the MacBook’s battery.[](https://eu.baseus.com/products/gan5-pro-flat-usb-c-wall-charger-65w)[](https://www.baseus.com/products/gan5-pro-flat-wall-charger-65w)
3. **MagSafe 3 Compatibility**: The MacBook Air M2 supports charging via both USB-C and MagSafe 3. The Baseus 67W GaN Lite charger can be used with a USB-C to USB-C cable or a USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable. However, one user reported that a similar Baseus charger (40W model) didn’t work with Apple’s MagSafe Duo, so if you plan to use MagSafe 3, ensure you have a compatible cable and test it for reliability.[](https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Included/dp/B0C28C7XGY)
4. **Multi-Device Charging**: The Baseus 67W GaN Lite charger has dual USB-C ports (and possibly a USB-A port, depending on the model). When using multiple ports, the power is split (e.g., 45W + 20W or 25W + 20W), which may reduce charging speed for the MacBook if another device is connected. For optimal fast charging, use a single USB-C port.[](https://eu.baseus.com/products/gan5-pro-flat-usb-c-wall-charger-65w)[](https://www.baseus.com/products/gan5-pro-flat-wall-charger-65w)
5. **Cable Requirements**: Ensure you use a high-quality USB-C cable rated for at least 100W (5A) to handle the full 65W output. Baseus often includes a compatible 100W USB-C cable with their chargers, which should work well.[](https://baseusonline.com/product/1254/baseus-gan5-pro-65w-3-port-fast-charger-2-type-c-usb-a-uk-plug-compatible-with-macbook-pro-air-ipad-pro-iphone-15-pro-max-samsung-s23-white-include-baseus-xiaobai-series-fast-charging-cable-type-c-to-type-c-100w-20v-5a-1m-white)[](https://www.baseus.com/products/gan5-pro-flat-wall-charger-65w)

### Potential Caveats
- **MagSafe Compatibility**: While the charger should work with a USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable, some third-party chargers have reported issues with specific MagSafe accessories (e.g., MagSafe Duo). If you’re using MagSafe 3, confirm compatibility with your cable.[](https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Included/dp/B0C28C7XGY)
- **Non-USB-IF Certification**: The Baseus 67W GaN Lite charger may not be USB-IF certified, unlike some competitors (e.g., Nekteck 60W). While Baseus is a reputable brand with safety features, non-certified chargers may have slightly less guaranteed compatibility with Apple’s strict standards.[](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-usb-c-macbook-and-laptop-chargers/)
- **Power Allocation**: If you charge multiple devices simultaneously, the MacBook may not receive the full 65W, potentially slowing charging. For fast charging, use the charger with only the MacBook connected.[](https://eu.baseus.com/products/gan5-pro-flat-usb-c-wall-charger-65w)

### Conclusion
The Baseus 67W GaN Lite charger is compatible with the MacBook Air M2 and can provide fast charging comparable to Apple’s 67W or 70W adapters when using a single USB-C port with a proper cable. It’s a compact, efficient alternative to Apple’s charger, ideal for travel or multi-device charging, though you should ensure a high-quality cable and be cautious with MagSafe 3 compatibility. If you prioritize fast charging, avoid using multiple ports simultaneously.
