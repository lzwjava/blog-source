title: How to Reassign Change Request Owners

Changing the owner of a **Change Request (CR)** depends on the tool or workflow system you are using (for example, ServiceNow, Jira, HP ALM, or a custom ITSM tool). But the general process is usually similar across platforms:

---

### 1. Locate the Change Request

* Go to the **Change Management** or **Requests** section of your ITSM tool.
* Search for the CR by ID, title, or other filters.
* Open the CR’s detail page.

---

### 2. Find the “Owner” or “Assigned To” Field

* Most systems have a field like **Change Owner**, **Assigned To**, or **Responsible Person**.
* This field controls who is responsible for the CR.
* If you don’t see it immediately, check under **Assignment** or **Ownership** tabs.

---

### 3. Update the Owner

* Click **Edit** or **Modify** the CR.
* Change the value of **Owner** (or “Assigned To”) to the new person.
* This is usually done by selecting a name from a dropdown list of users.
* Save or submit the update.

---

### 4. Check Role/Permission Requirements

* Some systems restrict owner changes to specific roles (e.g., **Change Manager**, **Admin**).
* If you don’t have permission, you’ll need to request a Change Manager or Admin to update it for you.

---

### 5. Notify Stakeholders

* Best practice: add a **comment** or **work note** in the CR explaining why ownership changed.
* Notify the new owner, so they’re aware of the responsibility.

---

✅ **Example (ServiceNow)**

1. Open the Change Request.
2. In the “Assigned To” field, select the new user.
3. Save the record.

✅ **Example (Jira)**

1. Open the Change Request issue.
2. Click the “Assignee” field.
3. Select the new owner.
