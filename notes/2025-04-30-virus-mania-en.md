"Virus Mania: How the Medical Industry Continually Invents Epidemics, Making Billion-Dollar Profits At Our Expense" is a book authored by Torsten Engelbrecht, Dr. Claus Köhnlein, Dr. Samantha Bailey, and Dr. Stefano Scoglio.

The book argues against the mainstream understanding of many infectious diseases. Its central thesis is that the existence and pathogenicity of numerous viruses, including those claimed to cause illnesses like COVID-19, measles, swine flu, SARS, BSE, Hepatitis C, AIDS, and polio, have not been scientifically proven.

Instead, the authors propose that the symptoms and conditions attributed to these viruses are often caused by other factors such as pharmaceuticals, lifestyle drugs, pesticides, heavy metals, pollution, malnutrition, and stress. They are critical of diagnostic methods like antibody tests and PCR, suggesting that these tests may detect particles produced by the body under stress rather than specific viruses.

"Virus Mania" contends that the medical industry, driven by profit motives, exaggerates or invents epidemics, leading to unnecessary fear, medical interventions, and vaccination campaigns. The book aims to challenge the established germ theory of disease and present an alternative perspective on the origins of various illnesses.
