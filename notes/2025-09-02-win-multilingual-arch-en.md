Windows 10 Enterprise isn’t built in just one language — it’s a large operating system with many components, each written in different programming languages chosen for their strengths. Here’s the breakdown:

**Core System and Kernel**

* Written primarily in **C** and **C++**.
* Performance-critical parts (like the Windows NT kernel, memory manager, I/O system) are mostly C, with some assembly for very low-level operations.

**System Services and APIs**

* **C and C++** dominate here too (e.g., Win32 API, DirectX, system libraries).
* Some parts of the .NET Framework and newer APIs are in **C#**.

**User Interface (Shell, Explorer, etc.)**

* Historically **C++ with COM (Component Object Model)**.
* Modern interface layers, like parts of Windows 10’s UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps and Settings, are written in **C#, XAML, and JavaScript**.
* Fluent Design and XAML UI elements are powered by C++ at the core but exposed via higher-level languages.

**Management, Scripting, and Automation**

* **PowerShell** (based on .NET and written largely in **C#**).
* Many system utilities also expose scripting interfaces.

**Security and Drivers**

* Kernel-mode drivers: mostly **C**, some **C++**, and assembly.
* User-mode drivers: often **C++**, sometimes **C#** for higher-level tools.

So, to summarize:

* **C and C++** are the foundation.
* **C# and .NET languages** are widely used in management tools and apps.
* **Assembly** is still there for low-level boot and performance-sensitive routines.
* **XAML/JavaScript** for parts of the modern UI stack.

👉 Would you like me to give you a **layered map** of Windows 10 Enterprise (kernel, drivers, system services, UI, management tools) showing which languages dominate each layer? That could make the picture clearer.
