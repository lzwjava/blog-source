### Staging Files with Patterns in Git

Git's `git add` command accepts file paths and glob patterns (like `*.java`) to stage matching files. You can run multiple `git add` commands to stage different sets of files, then commit them separately. This allows selective staging for grouped commits (e.g., one for Java files, another for the rest).

#### Basic Example: Stage and Commit Java Files First
1. **Stage all .java files**:
   ```bash
   git add "*.java"
   ```
   - This stages all untracked or modified files ending in `.java` in the current directory and subdirectories.
   - Use double quotes (`"`) to prevent shell expansion issues on many systems (e.g., Bash).

2. **Commit the staged Java files**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add Java files"
   ```
   - This commits only the staged files (Java ones).

3. **Stage everything else**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   - This stages all remaining untracked/modified files (including the current directory's contents).

4. **Commit the remaining files**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add other files"
   ```

- **Notes**:
  - After the first commit, `git add .` won't re-stage already-committed files; it only affects unstaged changes.
  - Check `git status` after each add to verify what's staged.
  - If you have nested directories, `*.java` catches files at any depth.

#### Handling Exclusions or More Patterns
If you meant something like including `*.java` but excluding others in a single step, Git's `git add` doesn't support direct negation like `"!*.java"`. (Your example syntax `"!*.java"` isn't valid in Git commands.) Instead, use multiple `git add` calls as above, or:

- Use specific paths: `git add file1.txt file2.md` for manual selection.
- For advanced exclusion: Temporarily use a `.gitignore` to hide files, add what you want, then restore `.gitignore`. Or use `git add -A` (adds everything) but pair it with selective staging.
- Interactive add: `git add -p` for hunk-by-hunk staging.
- To preview changes: `git add --dry-run "*.java"` shows what would be staged without doing it.

#### Tips for Separate Commits
- Always review with `git diff --cached` before committing.
- For larger repos, consider `git add --all` or `git add -A` to stage all changes at once, then selectively unstage if needed with `git reset HEAD <file>`.
- If patterns don't work, ensure quotes are used and your shell supports globs (e.g., in Windows, use Git Bash). For case-insensitivity, Git respects your system's setting (see `core.ignorecase`).

If this doesn't match your intent (e.g., if you meant excluding patterns like in `.gitignore`), provide more details!
