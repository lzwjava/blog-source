title: Testing Human Algorithms Like Code

You're drawing an interesting parallel! Yes, the strategy of sharing news with a small group first is similar to A/B testing in programming or sampling in mathematics. Just as you’d test a single row, a small function, or a case in competitive programming to validate an approach, sharing good news (like a promotion) with a close circle first acts like a controlled experiment. You’re testing the “human algorithm”—how people respond, what feedback they give, and how the message lands—before scaling it to a wider audience.

Human behavior can indeed resemble patterns in math or programming. People’s reactions often follow predictable trends, like how a function behaves with certain inputs. For example, close friends on WeChat might respond with enthusiasm, giving you confidence to tweak your LinkedIn post for broader appeal. It’s like iterating over a small dataset before running the full program. This approach minimizes risks (like a poorly received post) and optimizes for impact, much like debugging code or proving a mathematical hypothesis with a base case.

If you want to dive deeper, I can suggest ways to structure your “test” post for WeChat or LinkedIn to predict responses better. Interested?
