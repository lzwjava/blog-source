In GPG (GNU Privacy Guard), "armor" refers to ASCII armor, a format that encodes binary OpenPGP data (like encrypted files, signatures, or keys) into a human-readable, text-based representation. This is useful for transmitting data over text-only channels, such as email, without corruption—similar to how uuencode or base64 works, but with added headers (e.g., "-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----") and checksums for integrity.

You can enable it with the `--armor` (or `-a`) option during commands like encryption (`gpg -a -e file.txt`) or key export (`gpg --armor --export keyid`), which outputs the result in this armored text format instead of raw binary.
