## **1. Introduction**  
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with **scalars, vectors, matrices, and linear transformations**. It is a foundational subject in various fields, including **science, engineering, computer science, physics, and economics**.  

### **Definition and Importance**  
Linear algebra is the study of linear equations, vector spaces, and linear transformations. It provides tools to model real-world problems and solve them using systematic methods. Some important applications include:  
- **Engineering**: Structural analysis, electrical circuit design, control systems  
- **Physics**: Quantum mechanics, relativity, optics  
- **Computer Science**: Machine learning, graphics, data compression  
- **Economics**: Input-output models, optimization problems

## **2. Scalars, Vectors, and Matrices**  

### **Scalars**  
A **scalar** is a single numerical value, typically representing magnitude. Scalars are used in algebra and calculus, such as:  
\\[
a = 5, \quad b = -3, \quad c = 2.7
\\]  
Scalars follow the usual arithmetic rules (addition, multiplication, etc.).

### **Vectors**  
A **vector** is an ordered list of numbers, which can be visualized as an arrow in space. Vectors are used to represent quantities with both **magnitude** and **direction**, such as force, velocity, and acceleration.  

#### **Notation:**  
A vector in **2D space**:  
\\[
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}
\\]  
A vector in **3D space**:  
\\[
\mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 5 \end{bmatrix}
\\]  
Vectors can be **added, subtracted, and multiplied by scalars**.

#### **Vector Operations:**  
1. **Addition and Subtraction**  
   \\[
   \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}
   \\]  
2. **Scalar Multiplication**  
   \\[
   2 \mathbf{v} = 2 \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ 8 \end{bmatrix}
   \\]

### **Matrices**  
A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are fundamental in solving systems of equations, computer graphics, and machine learning.

#### **Example of a Matrix:**  
A **2×3 matrix** (2 rows, 3 columns):  
\\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}
\\]

#### **Basic Matrix Operations:**  
1. **Matrix Addition**  
   \\[
   A + B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & 8 \\ 10 & 12 \end{bmatrix}
   \\]
2. **Scalar Multiplication**  
   \\[
   3A = 3 \times \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 6 \\ 9 & 12 \end{bmatrix}
   \\]
