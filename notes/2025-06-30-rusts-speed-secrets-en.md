Rust's speed comes from its design as a systems programming language, emphasizing performance, memory safety, and concurrency. Here's a breakdown:

- **Performance**: Rust is compiled to native machine code via LLVM, making it comparable to C and C++ in terms of raw execution speed. Benchmarks often show Rust performing within 5-10% of C++ for compute-intensive tasks like numerical simulations, cryptography, or game engines. For example, in the [Computer Language Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/), Rust frequently matches or outperforms C++ in tasks like regex-redux or n-body simulations.

- **Memory Efficiency**: Rust's ownership model eliminates runtime garbage collection, unlike languages like Java or Go. This leads to predictable, low-latency performance, critical for real-time applications like embedded systems or game development. For instance, Mozilla's Servo browser engine, written in Rust, showed 2-4x faster page rendering compared to traditional engines in early tests.

- **Concurrency**: Rust’s strict compile-time checks for data races enable efficient multithreaded code. This makes it faster than languages like Python or JavaScript for parallel workloads. For example, the Rust-based `tokio` framework for async programming can handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal overhead, rivaling Go’s concurrency model but with lower memory usage.

- **Comparison**: 
  - **Python**: Rust is often 10-100x faster for CPU-bound tasks due to Python’s interpreted nature.
  - **Java**: Rust typically outperforms Java in low-level tasks due to no garbage collection pauses, though Java’s JIT can close the gap in long-running apps.
  - **Go**: Rust is faster for compute-heavy tasks but may trail in simplicity for networked apps due to Go’s lightweight goroutines.

- **Real-World Examples**: 
  - Discord uses Rust for high-performance backend services, reporting 10x throughput improvements over Python.
  - AWS’s Firecracker, a virtualization tool, leverages Rust for microsecond-level startup times.
  - Microsoft’s Windows kernel components in Rust reduced memory bugs without sacrificing speed.

Exact performance depends on the use case, optimization, and hardware. For precise comparisons, I can search for specific benchmarks or analyze code if you provide it. Want me to dig deeper into a particular aspect or benchmark?
