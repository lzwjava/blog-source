title: Fix Protobuf Compiler Build Error
translated: false
---

### Understanding the Error

This build failure happens during the compilation of Protocol Buffers (`.proto` files) in the `greptime-proto` crate. The build script (using `prost-build`) requires the `protoc` binary to generate Rust code from those proto definitions, but it can't find it on your system. This is a common prerequisite oversight when building projects like GreptimeDB that rely on gRPC and protobuf for internal communication.

The listed `.proto` files (e.g., `database.proto`, `health.proto`) are GreptimeDB's core definitions for metadata, regions, WAL, etc., so skipping this step blocks the entire build.

### Quick Fix

1. **Install the Protobuf Compiler** (≥ 3.15 required):
   - On Debian/Ubuntu (which matches your error hint):
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
     ```
   - On Fedora/RHEL:
     ```
     sudo dnf install protobuf-compiler
     ```
   - On macOS (if applicable):
     ```
     brew install protobuf
     ```
   - Manual download (cross-platform): Get the latest release from [Protocol Buffers releases](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases), extract, and add `bin/protoc` to your PATH.

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```
   protoc --version
   ```
   It should output something like `libprotoc 3.21.12` (or higher; anything ≥ 3.15 works).

3. **Retry the Build**:
   ```
   make clean  # Optional, to clear any partial artifacts
   make
   ```
   If `protoc` is installed but still not found (e.g., PATH issue), set the env var:
   ```
   export PROTOC=/usr/bin/protoc  # Adjust path as needed
   make
   ```

### Additional Tips
- Ensure you have the other prerequisites: Nightly Rust (which you seem to have from the prior error), GCC/G++ (install via `sudo apt install build-essential`), and glibc dev headers (`sudo apt install libc6-dev`).
- If you're in a container or custom env, add the install step there.
- For testing post-build: `cargo run --bin greptime -- standalone start`.

This should get you past the proto compilation. If it fails on something else (e.g., C++ deps), check the full prerequisites.
