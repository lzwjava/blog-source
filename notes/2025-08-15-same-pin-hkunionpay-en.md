Yes — for an **HSBC Hong Kong UnionPay debit card**, the PIN you use for UnionPay transactions in shops is generally the **same** as the 6-digit PIN you use to withdraw cash from an HSBC ATM.

That’s because UnionPay purchases in physical shops often require an **offline PIN** (the card’s own PIN), and HSBC issues only one debit card PIN for both **ATM withdrawals** and **POS transactions**.

The only exception would be if you manually requested HSBC to set a **different “purchase PIN”** (rare, and usually not offered by default in HK).

If you like, I can also explain how this works differently for **contactless UnionPay QuickPass payments** and **overseas use**.
