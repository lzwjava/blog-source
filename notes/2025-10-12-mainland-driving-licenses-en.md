Mainland driving licenses cannot be used directly in Hong Kong. According to Hong Kong's legal regulations, driving licenses held by mainland residents from China are not recognized as valid driving documents in Hong Kong. If you want to drive in Hong Kong, you must hold a valid Hong Kong driving license or an International Driving Permit (IDP), and comply with Hong Kong's driving regulations.

Specific situations are as follows:

1. **Short-term visitors (tourism or short stays)**:
   - If you are a short-term visitor (usually referring to stays in Hong Kong not exceeding 12 months), you can apply for and use an International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Hong Kong, but you need to carry your valid mainland driving license at the same time.
   - The International Driving Permit must be issued by a contracting party to the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic or the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. Mainland China is currently not a contracting party to these two conventions, so mainland driving licenses cannot directly apply for an IDP.
   - If you hold a driving license from another country or region (such as some countries allowing exchange for local licenses based on mainland licenses), and apply for an IDP through those countries, it may be usable in Hong Kong, but specific requirements need to be confirmed.

2. **Hong Kong residents or long-term stays**:
   - If you are a Hong Kong resident or plan to stay in Hong Kong long-term (more than 12 months), you need to apply for a Hong Kong driving license.
   - Mainland residents holding mainland driving licenses can apply for "direct issuance" of Hong Kong licenses (without taking driving tests), provided that your license meets the requirements of the Hong Kong Transport Department, and you need to submit relevant supporting documents (such as translated license copies, identity proofs, etc.).
   - For specific application procedures and required documents, please refer to the Hong Kong Transport Department website.

3. **Notes**:
   - If you drive in Hong Kong without a valid Hong Kong driving license or International Driving Permit, you may be considered as driving without a license, which is illegal and may result in fines, vehicle impoundment, or even more serious legal consequences.
   - It is recommended to consult the Hong Kong Transport Department or relevant institutions in advance before going to Hong Kong to confirm whether your driving license requires additional procedures or whether you need to obtain a local Hong Kong license.

If you have further questions or need help with specific application processes, you can provide more background information (such as your stay duration, driving needs, etc.), and I can help you find more detailed guidance!
