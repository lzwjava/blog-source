Alonzo Church (1903–1995) was a highly influential American computer scientist, mathematician, logician, and philosopher. He is recognized as a pivotal figure in the development of mathematical logic and the foundational principles of theoretical computer science.

Church's most significant contributions include:

* **Lambda Calculus:** He invented the lambda calculus in the 1930s, a formal system for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application. This work provided a foundational framework for modern computer programming languages, especially functional programming languages like Haskell and Lisp.
* **Church's Theorem:** Church proved the unsolvability of the *Entscheidungsproblem* (decision problem), demonstrating that there is no general algorithmic method to determine the truth or falsity of all mathematical statements. This result highlighted the inherent limitations of computational systems.
* **Church–Turing Thesis:** Alongside his doctoral student Alan Turing, Church formulated the Church–Turing thesis. This fundamental concept in computability theory posits that any effectively calculable function can be computed by a Turing machine or expressed in lambda calculus, establishing a strong link between these computational models and defining the boundaries of what can be computed.
* **Foundational Work in Logic:** Church was one of the founders of the discipline of mathematical logic and played a key role in establishing the Association for Symbolic Logic and the *Journal of Symbolic Logic*. His work extended to philosophical logic, epistemology, and metaphysics, often applying his "logistic method" to discuss philosophical topics.
* **Influence on Computer Science:** Church's work laid the groundwork for the modern theory of computation and the development of computer science as an academic discipline. His ideas have had a profound impact on programming language design, leading to concepts like functional programming, anonymous functions, and higher-order functions that are prevalent today.

Church taught philosophy and mathematics at Princeton University for nearly four decades and later held a professorship at the University of California, Los Angeles. His legacy is honored through the annual Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation.
