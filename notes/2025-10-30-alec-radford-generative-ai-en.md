### Birthdate
Alec Radford was born in April 1993.

### His Story
Alec Radford is a pioneering machine learning researcher whose work has profoundly shaped generative AI, particularly through his foundational contributions to the GPT series at OpenAI. Without a PhD, he dropped out of college to co-found a startup and quickly became one of the most influential figures in AI, often described as the "father of modern generative AI" by peers like Jeff Clune. His career reflects a self-directed, experimental approach—starting with building computers as a child, evolving into breakthroughs in image and language generation that power tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E. Here's a chronological overview of his life and achievements:

#### Early Life and Education (1993–2013)
Born in the affluent suburbs of Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, Radford showed an early knack for technology; his father helped him assemble his first computer at age 5. He attended the rigorous Cistercian Preparatory School (2007–2011), where he excelled as a nationally ranked academic quiz player, Eagle Scout, and editor of the school's literary magazine. In his writings, he geeked out over games like Minecraft, praising its open-ended creativity—a theme that echoed in his later AI work.

In 2011, he enrolled at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in Boston, a small, innovative school emphasizing hands-on, self-directed learning (he chose it over elite options like MIT for its intimacy). As a freshman, he bonded with future collaborators over late-night pizza sessions. By his sophomore year in late 2012, the AlexNet breakthrough in deep learning hooked him. He dove into Kaggle competitions and convinced skeptical friends of deep learning's potential, despite its then-nascent state.

#### Startup Days and GAN Breakthroughs (2013–2016)
In 2013, as juniors, Radford and classmate Slater Victoroff co-founded Indico, a data science startup, from their dorm room to democratize deep learning for developers. Joined by Diana Yuan and Madison May, they raised seed funding and worked grueling 5 p.m.–5 a.m. shifts. By 2014, they dropped out (except one who graduated), joined the Techstars accelerator, and secured $3 million in funding. At Indico, Radford's role was pure research: tinkering with generative models.

His obsession with "getting computers to make pretty pictures" led to landmark experiments. In early 2015, he tweeted early variational autoencoder (VAE) results for generating faces and pixel-art "people." Shifting to GANs, his July 2015 tweets of GAN-generated faces caught the eye of Facebook AI's Soumith Chintala. By October 2015, he achieved a crude but pioneering text-to-image generation. Teaming with Olin friend Luke Metz, they released the DCGAN paper in November 2015—a stable architecture for high-quality image synthesis that became a cornerstone of generative AI. His iconic tweet "THE PEOPLE ARE IN THE COMPUTER" captured the eerie magic of AI birthing human-like figures, blending art and tech.

#### OpenAI Era and GPT Revolution (2016–2024)
Radford joined OpenAI in 2016, a year after its founding, bringing his GAN expertise to language and multimodal AI. As lead author on the 2018 GPT-1 paper ("Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training"), he introduced the transformer-based architecture that scaled unsupervised pre-training on massive text data, laying the groundwork for the entire GPT lineage. This shifted AI from narrow tasks to broad, emergent capabilities like few-shot learning.

He co-authored GPT-2 (2019), which demonstrated scaling laws for language models, and contributed to GPT-3 (2020), powering early versions of ChatGPT. Beyond text, his work spanned CLIP (2021, aligning images and text for zero-shot learning), DALL-E (2021, text-to-image generation), Jukebox (2020, AI music), and DALL-E 2 (2022), which exploded generative AI into mainstream use. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman once tweeted praising him as "a genius at the level of Einstein." Radford's low-profile style—he rarely speaks publicly—belied his impact; colleagues credit him with intuitively grasping how to make models "creative" without over-engineering.

#### Recent Developments and Legacy (2024–Present)
In December 2024, Radford left OpenAI after eight years to pursue independent research, shaking the AI community. At 31, he's already transformed how machines generate text, images, audio, and code, influencing everything from ChatGPT to Stable Diffusion. His story is one of precocious curiosity over credentials: from Texas suburbs to dorm-room hustles to AI's vanguard, proving that bold experimentation can redefine paradigms.
