### Top Autonomous Driving Company Worldwide in 2025

As of October 2025, **Waymo** (Alphabet) remains the global leader in autonomous driving, with the most extensive commercial deployment of Level 4 (fully driverless) robotaxis. It operates in multiple U.S. cities, delivering over 250,000 paid rides weekly and logging 96+ million rider-only miles. However, including China shifts the landscape: **Baidu Apollo** is a close second, dominating Asia with Apollo Go robotaxis serving 10+ million cumulative rides across Beijing, Wuhan, and other cities, backed by China's regulatory support for AV testing.

China's ecosystem is booming, with over 30 cities permitting driverless operations and companies like Pony.ai and WeRide achieving international expansions (e.g., UAE, Singapore). Globally, the AV market is projected to reach $115 billion by 2033, driven by robotaxis and trucking. Rankings prioritize operational miles, commercial scale, safety records, and funding over market cap (which favors chipmakers like NVIDIA).
