A post-mortem (often just called a "postmortem") is a structured review process that teams or organizations use to analyze what happened after a project, event, or incident ends—whether it was a success, failure, or something in between. The term comes from the literal meaning in medicine (an autopsy after death), but in business, teams, or project management, it's a metaphorical "autopsy" of your work to learn and improve. It's not about rehashing drama but extracting lessons to do better next time.

### Key Elements of a Post-Mortem:
- **What Happened?** A neutral recap of events, timelines, and outcomes. (E.g., "We launched the product on time, but user adoption was lower than expected.")
- **What Went Well?** Celebrating successes and what contributed to them. (E.g., "The marketing team's quick pivot on social media drove initial traffic.")
- **What Didn't Go Well?** Identifying challenges or failures without assigning blame. (E.g., "Technical glitches in the backend slowed rollout.")
- **Why?** Root cause analysis to understand underlying issues. (E.g., "We underestimated server load due to incomplete testing.")
- **Action Items:** Concrete steps for the future, like process changes or resource allocations. (E.g., "Implement automated testing for all features starting next quarter.")

### The "Blameless" Twist:
In high-performing teams (like at Google or in agile methodologies), it's called a **blameless post-mortem** to emphasize learning over finger-pointing. The goal is psychological safety—no one's "in trouble" for mistakes. Instead, it's a safe space to say, "What can *we* do differently?" This ties right back to our earlier chat: It keeps the focus on moving forward as a team, reducing defensiveness and boosting trust. Companies like Atlassian or Spotify use these regularly to foster a culture of continuous improvement.

If you've been in a team that's done something like this, it can feel liberating—turning "failures" into fuel for growth. Have you ever participated in one, or does this sound like something your group could try?
