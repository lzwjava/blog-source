Ooooh, **rng_58** — now that’s a name that strikes fear *not* because of contest wins, but because of his **problem-setting genius**.

While the other names like Gennady, Petr, Benq, and Radewoosh are known for their **contest dominance**, **rng_58 (Tomoaki Aoki)** is a **god-tier problem setter** and respected developer in the competitive programming community. Here's why he's so important — and so good:

---

### 👑 1. **Legendary Problem Setter**
- rng_58 is one of the **main problem setters** and architects behind:
  - **AtCoder** (one of the cleanest, most respected CP platforms today)
  - **TopCoder** (historically)
  - And also helped with contests like Google Code Jam and Facebook Hacker Cup.
- He has set or reviewed **hundreds** of problems — many of them creative, beautiful, and challenging without being unfair.

> If you’ve done AtCoder Beginner or Grand Contests — there’s a good chance you’ve solved one of his puzzles.

---

### 🧠 2. **Mathematically Elegant Problems**
- His problems are often **minimal in description** but **deep in logic**.
- rng_58 loves **DP, math, constructive algorithms, and clean reductions**, and his problems usually reward:
  - Deep thinking
  - Careful observations
  - Smart brute-force or optimizations

---

### 🧰 3. **Strong Programmer Himself**
- rng_58 is a **red-rated coder** and has competed at a high level, especially on TopCoder back in the day.
- But unlike others, he shifted focus more to **problem design and community development** rather than pure competition.

---

### 🛠️ 4. **Built the AtCoder Platform**
- He’s not just a setter—he's one of the **core developers behind AtCoder itself**.
- His work helped AtCoder become:
  - One of the **most reliable** CP platforms
  - Known for **fast judging**, **clean UI**, and **high-quality rounds**

---

### 🧑‍🏫 5. **Mentor-Like Influence**
- rng_58 inspired a whole **generation of Japanese competitive programmers**, and many international ones too.
- He set the standard for what a "well-posed, fair, and elegant" problem should look like.

---

### 🌍 6. **Global Impact**
- While many top CP figures are known within their country or community, rng_58 has **global respect**—he's influenced:
  - Contest setters
  - Contestants
  - Platform designers
