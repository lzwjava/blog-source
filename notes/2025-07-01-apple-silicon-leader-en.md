## 🧠 **Technical Expertise and Knowledge**

Johny Srouji is an **expert in computer architecture, systems-on-chip (SoC), and semiconductor design**. His deep knowledge spans:

### 1. **Silicon Architecture and Microprocessor Design**

* He understands **chip instruction sets, pipelining, cache hierarchies, memory subsystems**, and **parallel processing**.
* Led Apple's development of **custom ARM-based processors** that replaced third-party chips from Intel and others.

### 2. **System on a Chip (SoC) Integration**

* Highly experienced in **integrating CPU, GPU, neural engines, memory controllers**, and **I/O subsystems** into a single chip with optimized power and performance.

### 3. **Power and Thermal Management**

* Deeply involved in developing low-power chips that enable **high performance while maximizing battery life**—a critical factor in mobile and wearable devices.

### 4. **Security and Hardware-Level Encryption**

* Oversaw development of **T-series chips** used in MacBook security (e.g., Secure Enclave for Touch ID).
* Specialized knowledge in **hardware-based encryption, secure boot, and data protection mechanisms**.

### 5. **Neural Engine and AI Acceleration**

* Pioneered the development of Apple’s **Neural Engine**, which handles machine learning tasks locally on devices (e.g., Face ID, photo classification).
