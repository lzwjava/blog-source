### Quitting Coffee for Good: A Personal Reflection

I've decided to quit coffee again—this time, for good.

Two years ago, I managed to quit for a while, but then I started a personal "campaign to abandon all medicines and chemicals," and that led me back to drinking coffee. Why? At the time, I believed that chemicals and drugs were all harmful, but coffee was a "natural product," and since I only drank one cup in the morning, I figured it was fine.

But now I've realized that not all natural products are trustworthy or safe for long-term use. It's a simple truth: many drugs are basically natural substances. For example, heroin is extracted from poppies (a plant). Heroin is certainly a natural product, yet it's harmful.

In modern society, some people get "addicted" to coffee—they can't function without it, needing multiple cups a day. Others don't develop a "physiological dependence" on caffeine, but they do have a "psychological dependence." Some love sitting in a coffee shop, zoning out, studying, or working, and naturally order a cup just by being there. Others start their workday by brewing a cup, inhaling the aroma to feel like the day can truly begin. This psychological dependence and sense of ritual is a form of addiction, much like the addiction to heroin or other drugs.

A senior researcher in the PL (Programming Languages) field once told me that coffee is a great thing—it makes you happy quickly, and the more you drink, the happier you get. But I've heard that heroin works the same way: it brings instant joy, and without it, you're in agony...

So, caffeine should be seen as in the same category as heroin—they're both addictive drugs, just varying in degree. That's why I need to quit caffeine entirely. Not just coffee, but anything containing it, including black tea and green tea.

Some might argue that coffee is a "traditional beverage" and thus harmless. But look into it, and you'll find that Italians didn't actually drink coffee before the 20th century—it only became part of their daily routine around then.

Why is the coffee industry booming these days, with more and more capital pouring in? I think it's because they know coffee is addictive—it's essentially a drug.

Many modern medicines are basically drugs too: once you start taking them, stopping can make things worse. Take blood pressure meds, for instance—after starting, quitting can spike your blood pressure even higher than before. That's severe physiological dependence.

The "Opium Wars" are happening all over again; people just haven't realized it.

Some might think I'm overreacting. I suggest watching this video—his views align closely with my feelings.

In short, people underestimate the health impact of that morning cup of coffee. While it might not keep me from falling asleep at night, it does affect sleep quality. After quitting, I've noticed a huge improvement in how deeply I sleep. You can't appreciate that refreshing, restorative feeling when you're still drinking coffee. This matters a lot because sleep is prime time for the body to repair itself. If sleep quality suffers, the body can't heal properly.

Plus, after stopping coffee, my mood feels more relaxed and at ease. Even one cup brings on this subtle, involuntary tension that prevents full relaxation. It's a nuanced sensation—you have to pay close attention to notice the difference.

I've had experiences like this a few times: after a bad night's sleep (say, from late-night thinking or an exciting social outing), I'd chug coffee the next morning to power through. But then I'd crash in the afternoon, grab another cup, and it spirals— that afternoon dose wrecks the following night's sleep. I'd feel exhausted but toss and turn, unable to drift off... and the third day's state? You can imagine the misery.

Once you've endured how painful that cycle is, you'll see that caffeine isn't some benign thing. Those experiences make the case for quitting crystal clear.

Quitting the physiological dependence on caffeine is one thing, but overcoming the psychological pull is another. Mornings without swinging by the coffee shop for a cup, that aroma, and a moment to daydream? It can make life feel bland. That's why I relapsed before—it mirrors how addicts relapse after detox. So, you have to actively tackle that psychological dependence, finding alternative "rituals" or "habits" to replace it.
