title: Karate Framework Workflow Visualization with Python
translated: false
---

This Python script uses the `networkx` and `matplotlib` libraries to **create and visualize a directed graph** representing the workflow of the **Karate Framework**, a popular API testing tool. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

---

## **1. Setup and Layout**
### **Imports**
- `networkx` (`nx`): A library for creating and manipulating graphs.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` (`plt`): Used for plotting and visualizing the graph.

### **Layout Function**
- `get_layout(G)`: Tries to use **Graphviz** (via `nx_agraph` or `nx_pydot`) for a clean, hierarchical layout. If Graphviz is not available, it falls back to a **spring layout** (force-directed algorithm).
- **Why?** Graphviz’s `dot` layout is ideal for directed graphs, as it arranges nodes in a top-down flow.

---

## **2. Graph Construction**
### **Create a Directed Graph**
- `G = nx.DiGraph()`: Initializes a directed graph.

### **Nodes**
- **Nodes** represent key components of the Karate Framework workflow (e.g., "Feature files", "Runner", "Karate engine").
- Each node is assigned a **category** (e.g., "Authoring", "Execution", "Runtime") for coloring and grouping.

### **Edges**
- **Edges** represent the flow between components, with labels describing the relationship (e.g., "execute", "invoke", "call APIs").
- Example: `"Feature files (.feature)" → "Runner (CLI/JUnit5/Maven/Gradle)"` with label "execute".

---

## **3. Visualization**
### **Node and Edge Styling**
- **Node colors**: Each category has a distinct color (e.g., "Authoring" is blue, "Execution" is orange).
- **Edge style**: Arrows show direction, with labels placed in the middle.

### **Plotting**
- `nx.draw_networkx_nodes`: Draws nodes with specified colors and sizes.
- `nx.draw_networkx_edges`: Draws edges with arrows.
- `nx.draw_networkx_labels`: Adds node labels.
- `nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels`: Adds edge labels.

### **Legend**
- A legend is added to explain the color-coding by category.

### **Output**
- The graph is saved as a PNG file in a `tmp` directory, with a message printed to confirm the save location.

## **4. Workflow Representation**
The graph visually explains the **Karate Framework’s workflow**:
1. **Authoring**: Write feature files (`.feature`).
2. **Execution**: A runner (CLI, JUnit5, Maven, Gradle) executes the tests.
3. **Runtime**: The Karate engine interprets the DSL and performs assertions.
4. **Protocols**: The engine makes HTTP/REST/GraphQL calls to external systems.
5. **External**: External systems/services respond to requests.
6. **Reporting**: Results are generated as reports (HTML, JUnit, JSON) and published to CI/CD pipelines.

## **Summary Table**

| Component                | Category    | Role in Workflow                          |
|--------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Feature files (.feature) | Authoring   | Test scenarios written in Gherkin         |
| Runner (CLI/JUnit5/...)  | Execution   | Executes the test scenarios               |
| Karate engine            | Runtime     | Interprets and runs the tests             |
| HTTP/REST/GraphQL        | Protocols   | Handles API communication                 |
| External systems         | External    | Receives requests and sends responses     |
| Assertions & matchers    | Runtime     | Validates responses                       |
| Reports                  | Reporting   | Generates test reports                    |
| CI/CD                    | Reporting   | Publishes reports in CI/CD pipelines      |

## **Why This Visualization?**
- **Clarity**: Shows the end-to-end flow of Karate tests.
- **Debugging**: Helps identify where issues might occur in the pipeline.
- **Documentation**: Serves as a quick reference for new users.

**In short:** This script automates the creation of a clear, color-coded workflow diagram for the Karate Framework, making it easier to understand and explain how tests are authored, executed, and reported.
