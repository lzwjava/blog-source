To perform remote debugging in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for a WebSphere Liberty Server running in debug mode, you can use VSCode's built-in Java debugging features. Below are the detailed steps to set this up without installing any WebSphere Liberty-specific plugins, assuming you have the standard **Java Extension Pack** (which includes the **Debugger for Java**) already installed.

---

### Step 1: Start the WebSphere Liberty Server in Debug Mode
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your WebSphere Liberty installation directory.
3. Run the following command to start your server in debug mode:
   ```
   server debug default
   ```
   - Replace `default` with your server's name if it’s different.
4. The server will start with debugging enabled, typically listening on port **7777**.
5. Check the server’s console output or logs for a message like:
   ```
   Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 7777
   ```
   - This confirms the debug port. If it’s a different port (e.g., due to a conflict), note the number displayed.

---

### Step 2: Configure Remote Debugging in VSCode
1. **Open Your Project in VSCode**:
   - Ensure your Java project (containing the source code deployed to the server) is open in VSCode. This allows the debugger to map breakpoints to the running code.

2. **Access the Run and Debug View**:
   - Click the **Run and Debug** icon in the left sidebar (a play button with a bug) or press `Ctrl+Shift+D` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+D` (Mac).

3. **Create or Edit the `launch.json` File**:
   - In the **Run and Debug** view, click the **gear icon** next to the configuration dropdown.
   - If prompted to select an environment, choose **Java**. This creates a `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` folder of your workspace.
   - If the file already exists, it will open for editing.

4. **Add a Debug Configuration**:
   - In the `launch.json` file, ensure it contains a configuration for attaching to the remote JVM. Here’s an example:
     ```json
     {
         "version": "0.2.0",
         "configurations": [
             {
                 "type": "java",
                 "name": "Attach to WebSphere Liberty",
                 "request": "attach",
                 "hostName": "localhost",
                 "port": 7777
             }
         ]
     }
     ```
   - **Explanation of Fields**:
     - `"type": "java"`: Specifies the Java debugger.
     - `"name": "Attach to WebSphere Liberty"`: A descriptive name for this configuration.
     - `"request": "attach"`: Indicates that VSCode will attach to an existing JVM process.
     - `"hostName": "localhost"`: The hostname of the machine running the server. Use the server’s IP address or hostname if it’s on a different machine.
     - `"port": 7777`: The debug port from Step 1. Update this if the server is using a different port.

5. **Save the File**:
   - Save the `launch.json` file after adding or editing the configuration.

---

### Step 3: Start the Debugging Session
1. **Ensure the Server is Running**:
   - Verify that the WebSphere Liberty Server is still running in debug mode from Step 1.

2. **Select the Configuration**:
   - In the **Run and Debug** view, select **"Attach to WebSphere Liberty"** from the dropdown menu at the top.

3. **Launch the Debugger**:
   - Click the green **play button** or press `F5`. VSCode will connect to the server’s JVM process.

4. **Set Breakpoints**:
   - Open your Java source files in VSCode.
   - Click in the gutter (left of the line numbers) to set breakpoints where you want execution to pause.

5. **Interact with the Application**:
   - Use your application (e.g., send HTTP requests) to trigger the code paths with breakpoints. When a breakpoint is hit, VSCode will pause execution, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and debug.

### Additional Notes
- **Local vs. Remote Server**:
  - If the server runs on a different machine, replace `"localhost"` with the server’s hostname or IP address in the `launch.json` file. Ensure the debug port is accessible through the network (e.g., not blocked by a firewall).

- **Debug Port Confirmation**:
  - If you’re unsure of the port, always check the server’s output after running `server debug default`. It will explicitly state the port it’s listening on.

- **Source Code Matching**:
  - The source code in VSCode must match the code running on the server for breakpoints to work correctly. Ensure your project is up-to-date and compiled with debug information (the default in most Java builds).

- **Server Behavior**:
  - With `server debug default`, the server starts immediately (not waiting for a debugger). You can attach VSCode at any time while it’s running.

- **Prerequisites**:
  - The **Java Extension Pack** (or at least the **Debugger for Java** extension) must be installed in VSCode. This is a standard tool for Java development and provides the necessary debugging capabilities.

By following these steps, you can effectively debug your WebSphere Liberty Server remotely using VSCode’s built-in features, without needing additional plugins specific to WebSphere.
