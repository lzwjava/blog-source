Here’s what I found out about **Sonoma Sky Alpha (openrouter/sonoma-sky-alpha)** — what it is, its features, what’s known and unknown. If you want, I can compare it to other models too.

---

## What is Sonoma Sky Alpha

* **Released through OpenRouter** as a frontier/alpha model. ([OpenRouter][1])
* It’s part of a pair: *Sonoma Sky Alpha* and *Sonoma Dusk Alpha*. ([Cline][2])
* Designed as a **general-purpose model** with strong capabilities: large context window, image input support, tool integrations. ([OpenRouter][1])

---

## Key Features

* **2,000,000 token context window** — very large, which means it can handle very long inputs without forgetting earlier parts. ([OpenRouter][1])
* **Supports image inputs** (i.e. not just text). ([OpenRouter][1])
* **Parallel tool calling** — likely means it can query tools or APIs in parallel, improving flexibility/responsiveness. ([OpenRouter][1])
* **Free to use (during testing / alpha period)** — cost is \$0 for input/output tokens for now. ([OpenRouter][1])
* **Logging for feedback/training** — user inputs/prompts/completions are logged by the model creator. ([OpenRouter][1])

---

## Speculations & Community Feedback

* Some people think this model might be related (or comparable) to **xAI’s Grok 4.2** because of similarities in performance, but that is speculation. ([Next Big Future][3])
* In usage, reported to be quite capable in terms of reasoning, but also some issues (e.g. hallucinations, tool-calling problems) especially when pushed hard. ([Cline][2])
* Users say it’s “fast” and “impressive” in free-alpha settings, though not yet as stable or polished as some better known models. ([Cline][2])

---

## What Isn’t Clear / What to Watch Out For

* Who exactly built it (which lab/company) is not confirmed publicly. The origin is “mysterious” or “stealthy” as many write-ups describe. ([Cline][2])
* How well it handles very complex tasks, very specific domain knowledge, or consistency over long usage is still being tested. ([Cline][2])
* Because it’s in alpha, there is likely variation in availability, stability, possibly changing parameters or behavior over time.

If you like, I can pull up a *side by side* of Sonoma Sky Alpha vs (say) GPT-4 / Claude / others on specific tasks (reasoning, coding, images). Do you want that?
