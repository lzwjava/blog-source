### Recommended Setup for Managing Two Simultaneous Projects

Given your background as a seasoned engineer with extensive experience in full-stack development, AI tools, and self-taught practices, plus your familiarity with tools like iTerm, VSCode, and IDEA (IntelliJ), your concern about context switching between two projects makes sense—especially in the AI era where running multiple instances of Claude Code (likely the command-line interface for Claude AI) and juggling terminals/editors can lead to confusion and errors. Based on best practices from developer communities, including those highlighted in resources like VS Code documentation on multi-root workspaces and discussions on minimizing context switching, here's a balanced, practical recommendation. The goal is to create isolated "contexts" for each project without resorting to extreme measures like two laptops, while leveraging your existing tools.

#### Why Not Two Laptops?
- **Overkill and Costly**: While it eliminates overlap, it's inefficient, expensive (you're already mobile with three phones and travel habits), and doesn't scale. Most developers manage multiple projects on one machine using smarter organization.
- **Better Alternatives**: Focus on software-based isolation with hardware like extra monitors if needed. If you have a powerful laptop (e.g., MacBook with M-series chips), it's sufficient.

#### Core Strategy: Isolate Contexts with Named Sessions and Dedicated Windows
The key to avoiding "what project is what" mistakes is **complete separation**—no shared tabs, windows, or workspaces that force switches. Treat each project as its own virtual "desktop." This draws from advice in article summaries like those on using Tmux for simultaneous projects and VS Code multi-root setups for related work. Structure your workflow around:
- Separate editor instances/windows for coding.
- Named, persistent terminal sessions for AI interactions, commands, and debugging.
- Optional OS-level virtual desktops for visual separation.

1. **Terminal Management with Tmux (Integrated with iTerm)**:
   - Tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) is ideal for this—it's built for handling multiple named sessions, windows, and panes without UI confusion. Run two dedicated tmux sessions, one per project. [1]
   - **Setup Steps**:
     - Install/reconfirm tmux if needed (`brew install tmux` on macOS).
     - Create named sessions: `tmux new -s project1` and `tmux new -s project2`. Attach with `tmux a -t project1`.
     - Inside each session, split panes (e.g., `Ctrl-b %` for vertical split): Use one pane for Claude Code interactions, another for build/debugging.
     - Detach/reattach without stopping work: Hit `Ctrl-b d` to detach, then reattach later—perfect for interruptions.
   - **Why It Helps**: Each session is isolated; labels ("project1-cli" headers) prevent mixing tabs. Since you're proficient with iTerm, integrate tmux for tmuxinator (a tmux session manager) to save custom layouts per project. This avoids "two terminals" chaos by consolidating into organized, switchable contexts.
   - **AI Integration**: Run `claude code` in separate tmux panes for each project. Detach Claude instances if needed—Claude Code supports persistent sessions.

2. **Editor Setup: Dedicated VS Code or IDEA Instances (Not Shared Workspaces)**:
   - For unrelated projects (your case), avoid VS Code multi-root workspaces—they're better for related folders (e.g., app + docs), not full separation. Instead, open **two separate VSCode/IntelliJ windows**, each locked to one project root. [2][3]
   - **Setup Steps in VSCode** (similar for IDEA):
     - Open project1: `code /path/to/project1`.
     - Open project2 in a new window: `code --new-window /path/to/project2`.
     - Custom labels: Rename window titles via vs-code-settings for clarity (e.g., "MobileProj" vs "BackendProj").
   - **Why It Helps**: No risk of editing the wrong file—each window is isolated. Use extensions like "Project Manager" for quick switching, but minimize tabbing. For AI coding, VS Code's GitHub Copilot or Claude extensions can run per-instance, syncing only to that project's context.
   - **Alternative if Projects Are Related**: If they share code (unlikely from your description), use a multi-root workspace in one VSCode instance and add a second editor for the unrelated one.

3. **OS-Level Organization: Virtual Desktops + Optional Multi-Monitor**
   - On macOS (assuming iTerm and your tools), use **Mission Control** for virtual desktops—one desktop/project. [4]
     - Assign Desktop 1: Tmux session + VSCode for Project 1.
     - Desktop 2: Tmux session + VSCode for Project 2.
     - Switch with `Ctrl+Left/Right Arrow`.
   - **Multi-Monitor Bonus**: If you can add a second monitor (you seem gadget-heavy, so this fits), dedicate one physical screen to each project. Place Project 1's editor and terminal on Screen 1, Project 2 on Screen 2. Reduces mental load significantly.
   - **Rationale**: Physical/visual separation prevents accidental context bleed, unlike scrolling tabs. It's low-cost and aligns with productivity tips emphasizing "minimal & clean" workspaces. [4][5]

#### Additional Tips for Your AI-Heavy Workflow
- **Logging and Testing**: Since you log extensively, use project-specific log files or tools like Observepy. Test in isolated environments (e.g., Docker containers per project) to avoid overlaps.
- **Automation**: Script startup (e.g., bash script to launch tmux + editor for a project). Integrate with your "autonomous AI agent" style—use scripts to spawn Claude Code in the right session.
- **Avoid Burnout**: While this setup enables parallelism, don't overdo—focus on one task/feature per project session to minimize mental fatigue. Resources like productivity guides warn of 40% productivity loss from over-switching. [6][7]
- **Scaling**: If you add a third project, use named desktops/tmux sessions. For unlimited, consider VMs (VirtualBox) for each project, mounted as separate machines.
- **Quick Checks**: Label everything (e.g., terminal backgrounds/titles). Use hotkeys (Cmd+Tab guidelines) sparingly.

This approach leverages your expertise (e.g., full-stack, containers) without new expenses. If projects share resources (e.g., same MySQL instances), add safeguards like Docker Compose per project. Test it for a day—adjust based on your prolific experimentation style. If you provide more details on the projects or your hardware, I can refine further. [8][9]
