The blog at http://danaxu.blogspot.com/ is a personal journal by Dana N. Xu, blending English and Chinese entries. It focuses on introspective reflections on daily life, cultural observations (especially while living in France), philosophy drawn from ancient Chinese texts, artistic inspirations like painting, family warmth, and simple joys in nature and food. Themes often emphasize personal growth, embracing change, the beauty of simplicity, and finding motivation in small moments—such as seasonal tree trimming in Paris or the metaphorical "challenge" of trying durian fruit.

The blog appears inactive, with the most recent posts from 2013. Here's a quick look at the latest entries (from oldest to newest for context):

- **Durian** (Oct 28, 2010): Explores the divisive tropical fruit as a life lesson in persistence—its strong smell might repel at first, but it can grow on you, much like enduring hardships for eventual reward.
- **Warmth and Peace** (Nov 20, 2010): A brief musing on emotional anchors, like the comforting sight of a grandmother sewing or a mother reading.
- **Art** (Dec 5, 2010): Recounts a spontaneous day of sketching and water painting in wintery Paris, inspired by a lake trip, highlighting the joy of acting on creative urges despite discomfort.
- **给树理发** (Feb 19, 2011): Observes French workers artistically pruning trees for spring, likening it to a haircut and reflecting on renewal in nature.
- **《大学》** (Apr 29, 2013): Quotes from the ancient Chinese classic *The Great Learning*, discussing steps toward moral self-cultivation and inner peace.

Overall, it's a cozy, motivational read for fans of cross-cultural personal essays.
