Ajay V. Bhatt is an Indian-American computer architect and technologist, widely recognized as the co-inventor of the Universal Serial Bus (USB), a technology that revolutionized device connectivity and became a global standard for data transfer and power delivery. Born on September 6, 1957, in Vadodara, Gujarat, India, Bhatt’s innovative contributions extend beyond USB to include technologies like Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), PCI Express, Platform Power Management architecture, and various chipset advancements. With over 38 years of experience in the computer industry, Bhatt has established himself as a thought leader in platform and silicon-level architecture, holding 132 U.S. and international patents, with several more pending. His work has not only transformed the tech landscape but also earned him prestigious accolades, including the Padma Shri, India’s fourth-highest civilian honor, in 2025.

Bhatt’s journey began with a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering from the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in 1980, followed by a master’s degree from the City University of New York. His early career included roles at Indian microcomputer firms DSI and ORG Systems, as well as Wang Laboratories, before he joined Intel in 1990 as a senior staff architect in the chipset architecture team in Folsom, California. At Intel, Bhatt’s vision for simplifying device connectivity led to the creation of USB in the mid-1990s, driven by personal frustrations with the complex tangle of cables and connectors required for peripherals like printers and keyboards. Inspired by the simplicity of a wall outlet, he spearheaded a team from seven companies—Compaq, DEC, IBM, Intel, Nortel, Microsoft, and NEC—to develop a universal, plug-and-play interface. Despite initial skepticism from industry peers, Intel’s decision to make USB royalty-free and open-source fueled its widespread adoption, with over 10 billion USB-equipped devices in use today.

Beyond USB, Bhatt’s contributions to AGP and PCI Express improved graphics and data transfer performance, while his work on Platform Power Management enhanced energy efficiency in computing systems. His collaborative approach, humility, and focus on accessibility have defined his career, as he consistently credits his team for his successes. Bhatt’s innovations earned him global recognition, including the 2013 European Inventor Award, the 2012 Light of India Award, and the 2013 Outstanding Achievement in Science & Technology Award at The Asian Awards. A 2009 Intel ad campaign, portraying him as a “rock star” (played by actor Sunil Narkar), brought him mainstream fame, cementing his status as a tech icon.

Bhatt’s legacy is one of problem-solving and impact-driven innovation. His decision to prioritize change over personal profit—USB generated no direct financial gain for him—reflects his commitment to making technology user-friendly and universally accessible. Currently, Bhatt continues to influence the industry, notably through efforts to standardize stylus technology for cross-platform compatibility. As a trailblazer of Indian origin, featured in GQ India’s “50 Most Influential Global Indians” in 2010, Bhatt remains an inspiration for engineers and innovators worldwide, embodying the spirit of invention born from necessity.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajay_Bhatt)[](https://computermuseum.in/ajay-v-bhatt/)[](https://www.indiafirstlife.com/indias-firsts/tech-and-engineering/ajay-bhatt-usb-innovation)
