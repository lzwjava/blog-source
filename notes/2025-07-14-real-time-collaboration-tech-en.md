Google Docs uses a sophisticated **real-time collaboration algorithm** to allow multiple users to edit a document simultaneously. The core technology behind this is based on **Operational Transformation (OT)** and later evolved to incorporate **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)** in some systems. Here’s a breakdown of the key components:

### 1. **Operational Transformation (OT)**
   - **Basic Idea**: OT resolves conflicts by transforming (adjusting) incoming operations against previously applied operations.
   - **How It Works**:
     1. When a user makes an edit (e.g., inserting text), the client generates an **operation** (e.g., `insert("hello", pos=5)`).
     2. The operation is sent to the server, which **transforms** it against concurrent edits from other users to maintain consistency.
     3. All clients apply operations in a way that ensures eventual consistency.
   - **Example**: If User A inserts "abc" at position 5 while User B deletes position 5, OT adjusts B’s operation to delete position 8 (after A’s insertion).
   - **Challenges**: OT requires a central server to manage transformations, making it complex to implement correctly.

### 2. **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**
   - **Basic Idea**: CRDTs allow distributed systems to merge edits without a central server by designing data structures that always converge.
   - **How It Works**:
     1. Edits are tagged with unique identifiers (like timestamps or vector clocks).
     2. The system merges edits using mathematical properties (e.g., commutative, associative operations).
   - **Advantages Over OT**:
     - No need for a central server (works peer-to-peer).
     - More robust for offline editing.
   - **Example**: Instead of tracking positions by numbers, CRDTs might use fractional indexing (e.g., "A" < "A1" < "B") to avoid conflicts.

### 3. **Google’s Implementation (Wave/OT Hybrid)**
   - Google Docs was originally based on **Google Wave’s OT algorithm**, which extended classic OT with:
     - **Centralized Server**: Ensures all operations are transformed correctly.
     - **Differential Synchronization**: Minimizes data sent over the network.
   - Over time, Google likely incorporated **CRDT-like optimizations** for better offline support.

### 4. **Other Key Technologies**
   - **Frontend/Backend Sync**: Uses **WebSockets/long-polling** for real-time updates.
   - **Version Vectors/Logical Clocks**: Track causality of edits.
   - **Conflict Resolution**: If two users edit the same text simultaneously, the system resolves conflicts via OT/CRDT rules.

### **Comparison: OT vs. CRDT**

| Feature               | OT (Google Docs Classic) | CRDT (E.g., Figma, Notion) |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Central Server Needed | Yes                      | No (peer-to-peer possible) |
| Offline Support       | Limited                  | Better                    |
| Complexity            | High (transformation logic) | High (data structure design) |
| Latency               | Low (server-managed)     | Depends on implementation |

### **Why Google Likely Uses OT (with CRDT Influences)**
- OT is well-suited for **centralized** services like Google Docs.
- CRDTs are gaining popularity in decentralized apps (e.g., **Figma, Apple Notes**), but Google’s infrastructure is optimized for OT.
