Luca Cardelli is a highly distinguished Italian computer scientist, widely recognized for his innovative and impactful contributions across various areas of computer science, particularly in programming languages and concurrency, and more recently, in programmable biology and nanotechnology.

Born near Montecatini Terme, Italy, Cardelli pursued his education at the University of Pisa, receiving his M.Sc., and later earned his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Edinburgh in 1982.

His extensive career includes significant research positions at prominent institutions:

* **Bell Labs, Murray Hill** (1982-1985)
* **Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Systems Research Center in Palo Alto** (1985-1997)
* **Microsoft Research, Cambridge UK** (1997-2018), where he led the Programming Principles and Tools and Security groups.
* **University of Oxford** (since 2013), where he holds a Royal Society Research Professorship.

Cardelli's research is characterized by its breadth and depth, spanning:

* **Programming Languages:** He is a leading figure in type theory and operational semantics. His work laid foundational principles for modern programming languages, notably through his co-authorship of the influential book "A Theory of Objects" with Martin Abadi. He contributed to the design of Modula-3, implemented the first compiler for ML, and designed experimental languages like Obliq and Polyphonic C#. His 1985 paper "On understanding types, data abstraction, and polymorphism" (with Peter Wegner) is highly cited.
* **Concurrency Theory:** His interest in concurrency led him to develop the Ambient Calculus and spatial logics, providing a formal framework for analyzing global and mobile computation, relevant to distributed systems and the World Wide Web.
* **Systems Biology and Molecular Programming:** In recent years, Cardelli has transitioned to applying computational techniques to model biological systems, focusing on areas like DNA computing, molecular programming, and quantitative semantics. His work in this field includes designing programming languages for DNA circuits and analyzing biochemical reaction networks.

Luca Cardelli has been recognized with numerous accolades for his significant contributions, including:

* Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) (2005)
* Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM Fellow) (2004)
* Elected Member of the Academia Europaea
* Elected Member of the Association Internationale pour les Technologies Objets (AITO)
* Dahl–Nygaard Prize (2007)
* Programming Languages Achievement Award (2015)

He has published over 100 papers and one book, and has served as chair or editor for several important conference proceedings, including POPL (Principles of Programming Languages), ECOOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and DNA (DNA Computing and Molecular Programming).
