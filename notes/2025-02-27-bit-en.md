title: Bit Manipulation in Java
translated: false
---

Bit manipulation uses bitwise operators to solve problems efficiently. Let’s explore finding a single number and checking if a number is a power of 2.

## 1. Single Number: XOR Magic
Find the only non-repeating number in an array where all others appear twice using XOR.

### Java Implementation
```java
public class SingleNumber {
    public static int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int num : nums) result ^= num;
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {2, 2, 1, 1, 4};
        System.out.println("Single number: " + singleNumber(nums));
    }
}
```
**Output:** `Single number: 4`

## 2. Power of 2: Bit Check
A number is a power of 2 if it has exactly one 1-bit in its binary representation.

### Java Implementation
```java
public class PowerOfTwo {
    public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 16;
        System.out.println(n + " is power of 2: " + isPowerOfTwo(n));
        n = 18;
        System.out.println(n + " is power of 2: " + isPowerOfTwo(n));
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
16 is power of 2: true
18 is power of 2: false
```

## Conclusion Across Blogs
- **Sorting:** Quicksort, merge sort, and bubble sort cover speed, stability, and simplicity.
- **Strings:** KMP, tries, and Rabin-Karp handle pattern matching and prefix searches.
- **Searching:** Binary and linear search offer logarithmic and linear solutions.
- **Graphs:** DFS, BFS, Dijkstra’s, and Kruskal’s tackle traversal, paths, and MSTs.
- **Bit Manipulation:** XOR and bit checks solve tricky problems with minimal operations.
