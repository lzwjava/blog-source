**Titanium** (symbol: **Ti**, atomic number: 22) is a strong, lightweight, corrosion-resistant metallic element.

### Key Properties
- **High strength-to-weight ratio**: As strong as steel but 45% lighter
- **Exceptional corrosion resistance**: Forms a protective oxide layer that withstands saltwater, chlorine, and many acids
- **Biocompatible**: Non-toxic and not rejected by the human body
- **High melting point**: 1,668°C (3,034°F)

### Where It's Found
- 9th most abundant element in Earth's crust, but never pure in nature
- Always bound with other elements (mainly as titanium dioxide TiO₂ in minerals like rutile and ilmenite)
- Extracted through the complex and energy-intensive Kroll process

### Major Uses
- **Aerospace**: Jet engines, airframes (where strength, heat resistance, and lightness are critical)
- **Medical**: Surgical implants, dental fixtures, prosthetics
- **Military**: Armor plating, missiles, submarines
- **Consumer**: High-end watches, jewelry, eyeglass frames, premium sports equipment
- **Industrial**: Chemical processing equipment, desalination plants

### Why It Matters
Its unique combination of properties makes it irreplaceable for extreme-performance applications, though its high cost limits use to high-value products. Titanium dioxide is also the world's brightest white pigment, used in paint, sunscreen, and toothpaste.
