### Major Databases in the Market (2025)

Based on the latest popularity rankings from DB-Engines (which measure factors like mentions in technical discussions, job postings, social media activity, and search trends), the database management systems (DBMS) market in 2025 is dominated by a mix of relational (SQL-based) and NoSQL options. Oracle continues to lead, but there's notable growth in cloud-native and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL and Snowflake.

Here's a summary of the top 10 DBMS by popularity score:
