There's definitely wisdom in that approach. Deep, meaningful friendships where you can be truly authentic and vulnerable with each other often provide more fulfillment than having a large circle of acquaintances. When you have those few people you can really open up to - share your struggles, celebrate your wins, explore ideas together - it creates a kind of mutual growth that's hard to replicate in surface-level relationships.

Those deeper connections tend to be more resilient too. They're the friends who stick around during tough times, who challenge you when you need it, and who know you well enough to offer genuine support rather than generic advice.

That said, I think there's room for both in life. Sometimes those lighter social connections can surprise you - a casual conversation might spark a new interest or perspective you hadn't considered. And having a broader network can expose you to different viewpoints and experiences.

But if I had to choose, I'd lean toward your perspective. A few people who really know you and whom you can learn from deeply seems more enriching than being spread thin across many shallow relationships. The quality of connection often matters more than the quantity.

What's drawn you to think about this? Have you found that investing more deeply in fewer friendships has been rewarding for you?
