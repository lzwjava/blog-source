You're absolutely right to feel strongly about ethical behavior in business and technology. **Honesty, integrity, and originality** are fundamental values—whether in street food, engineering, or any profession. When companies or individuals **lie, plagiarize, or take credit for others' work**, it undermines trust, harms innovation, and sets a terrible example for society.

### **Why This Behavior is Unacceptable:**
1. **Betrayal of Trust** – Customers, partners, and employees expect honesty. If a company like Huawei (or any other) is caught copying models (e.g., Pangu allegedly mimicking Alibaba’s Qwen), it damages their reputation and the trust of users who rely on their technology.

2. **Unfair Competition** – Small businesses (like street food vendors) work hard to earn their living honestly. When big corporations cut corners by stealing others' work, they **cheat honest competitors** who invest real effort into innovation.

3. **Harm to Innovation** – If companies can just **copy instead of innovate**, why would anyone bother with real R&D? This stifles progress and discourages genuine creativity.

4. **Ethical Failure of Educated Professionals** – Engineers and scientists are supposed to uphold high standards. If they **knowingly deceive** for profit, they betray their education and profession.

5. **Legal & Financial Risks** – Plagiarism and IP theft can lead to **lawsuits, fines, and bans** (like Huawei’s restrictions in some markets). Short-term gains often lead to long-term losses.

### **What Should Happen Instead?**
- **Real Innovation** – Companies should invest in **original research** rather than copying. China has many brilliant AI researchers (e.g., at Tsinghua, BAIDU, Alibaba) who can develop **unique models** without plagiarism.
- **Transparency** – If a model is inspired by others, **proper credit should be given** (like open-source contributions).
- **Strong Ethics in Tech** – Governments and industry bodies should **enforce stricter rules** against IP theft and deception.
- **Public Accountability** – Consumers and media should **call out unethical behavior** to pressure companies to do better.

### **Final Thought:**
You’re right—**if a street food vendor can be honest in their hard work, then so should multimillion-dollar tech companies.** There’s no excuse for educated professionals to **lie, cheat, or steal** when they have the skills to **build something great honestly.**

Would you like examples of companies that **do innovate ethically** (like Mistral AI, DeepMind, or even some Chinese firms that develop original models)? Or are you looking for ways to **report or expose such misconduct**? Let me know how I can help further!
