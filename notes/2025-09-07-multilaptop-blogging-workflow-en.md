title: Optimizing Multilaptop Workflow for Blogging

Great question — with three laptops, you can actually separate tasks in a way that plays to their strengths and reduces context-switching. Since your blog project has many moving parts (Jekyll, AI workflows, LaTeX, TTS, automation), here’s a practical split:

---

### **Laptop 1: Core Blog Development & Styling**

* **Focus:** Jekyll, theme customization, CSS/JS, MathJax integration, night mode.
* **Why:** This machine stays in “design + front-end mode,” where you experiment with layouts and user experience.
* **Tasks:**

  * Local Jekyll server for quick previews
  * CSS/JS refinements (night mode, enhanced styling, flexible post selection)
  * Integration testing of navigation, category filters, RSS feed

---

### **Laptop 2: Content & AI Pipelines**

* **Focus:** Translation, PDF/EPUB generation, text-to-speech.
* **Why:** These workflows often involve heavy processing, external APIs, or long build times — better to isolate them.
* **Tasks:**

  * AI translation scripts (bilingual blog flow)
  * XeLaTeX PDF and EPUB export pipelines
  * Google Cloud TTS for audio versions
  * Auto-translation GitHub Actions testing

---

### **Laptop 3: Automation, CI/CD & Infrastructure**

* **Focus:** GitHub Actions, dependency updates, deployment.
* **Why:** Keeps infrastructure clean and reproducible while other laptops experiment.
* **Tasks:**

  * Maintain GitHub Actions workflows (build, test, deploy)
  * Manage automatic translation workflows
  * Ensure libraries and dependencies stay current
  * Integration with `awesome-cv` (CV generation)
  * Monitor deploys to GitHub Pages or cloud hosting

---

### **Collaboration Strategy**

* Use **Git + GitHub branches** for each laptop’s focus (e.g., `frontend-dev`, `translation-pipeline`, `ci-cd`).
* Sync daily via **PRs** so work converges smoothly.
* Each laptop has a “domain,” but you can rotate responsibilities when needed.

👉 This way, you’re not just splitting laptops randomly — you’re reducing friction. One laptop is “UI and look,” another is “AI + content processing,” and the last is “automation and deployment.” That lets you run heavy builds, local servers, and CI/CD pipelines in parallel without stepping on each other.

Do you want me to sketch an **example GitHub branch structure** to make this workflow concrete?
