### Overview
The Equality Act 2010 is a key piece of UK legislation that consolidates and strengthens anti-discrimination laws. It was passed by the UK Parliament and came into full force on 1 October 2010. The Act aims to promote equality by protecting individuals from unfair treatment in various aspects of life, including work, education, housing, and public services. It replaced nine previous anti-discrimination laws (such as the Race Relations Act 1976, Sex Discrimination Act 1975, and Disability Discrimination Act 1995) with a single, streamlined framework to make it easier to understand and enforce.

### Key Purposes
- **Prevent discrimination**: It makes it unlawful to treat someone less favourably due to a "protected characteristic."
- **Advance equality**: Requires public bodies to consider how their policies affect people with different protected characteristics.
- **Foster good relations**: Encourages understanding between diverse groups.

### Protected Characteristics
The Act covers nine main characteristics:
- Age
- Disability
- Gender reassignment
- Marriage and civil partnership
- Pregnancy and maternity
- Race
- Religion or belief
- Sex
- Sexual orientation

### Types of Discrimination Covered
- **Direct discrimination**: Treating someone worse because of a protected characteristic (e.g., refusing a job due to race).
- **Indirect discrimination**: Policies that seem fair but disadvantage a group (e.g., a uniform policy that affects those with religious headwear).
- **Harassment**: Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that violates dignity or creates a hostile environment.
- **Victimisation**: Treating someone badly for complaining about discrimination or supporting a complaint.
- **Discrimination arising from disability**: Unfavourable treatment because of something connected to a disability (unless justified).

### Scope and Enforcement
The Act applies across England, Scotland, and Wales (with some variations in Northern Ireland). It covers:
- Employment (recruitment, pay, promotions, dismissals).
- Services and public functions (e.g., shops, transport, healthcare).
- Education (schools, universities).
- Associations (e.g., clubs, societies).
- Premises (e.g., renting or buying property).

Enforcement is typically through employment tribunals, county courts, or the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). Individuals can claim compensation for discrimination, and employers must make "reasonable adjustments" for disabled people.

As of November 2025, the Act remains the primary equality law, with ongoing guidance updated to reflect modern contexts like remote work and emerging social issues.
