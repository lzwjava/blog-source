### Major Academic Conferences in AI, LLM, and NLP

Academic conferences in AI (Artificial Intelligence), LLM (Large Language Models), and NLP (Natural Language Processing) are key venues for researchers to present peer-reviewed papers, discuss breakthroughs, and collaborate. These events emphasize rigorous research, often with acceptance rates under 25%. Below, I've compiled a list of the most prominent ones, focusing on flagship conferences. I've prioritized those with strong academic focus and relevance to your query, including upcoming 2025/2026 events where dates are confirmed. For LLM-specific topics, many are integrated into broader AI/NLP tracks.

| Conference | Full Name | Focus Areas | 2025 Dates & Location | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|-------|
| NeurIPS | Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems | Machine learning, deep learning, LLMs, generative AI, optimization | December 2–7, San Diego, CA, USA | Premier ML conference; features workshops on LLMs and ethics. Acceptance ~20-25%. |
| ICML | International Conference on Machine Learning | Core ML algorithms, LLMs, reinforcement learning, NLP applications | July 13–19, Vancouver, BC, Canada | Top venue for theoretical and applied ML; includes LLM training/evaluation tracks. |
| AAAI | AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence | Broad AI, including NLP, computer vision, robotics, AI ethics | February 25–March 4, Philadelphia, PA, USA | Long-standing flagship; strong on interdisciplinary AI research. |
| ACL | Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | NLP, LLMs, multilingual models, semantics, generation | July 27–August 1, Vienna, Austria | Core NLP event; heavy emphasis on LLMs and transformers. |
| EMNLP | Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Empirical NLP, LLMs, text generation, evaluation | November (exact dates TBD), Hybrid (virtual + in-person) | Focuses on practical NLP experiments; often co-located with other NLP events. |
| IJCNLP-AACL | International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing - Asia-Pacific | Multilingual NLP, LLMs for low-resource languages, Asian languages | November 2–7, Hanoi, Vietnam | Regional but global reach; workshops on LLM hallucinations and precision. |
| RANLP | Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing | Multilingual LLMs, generative AI, low-resource NLP | September 8–10, Varna, Bulgaria | Biennial; features talks on open-source LLMs and cultural biases. |
| NAACL | North American Chapter of the ACL | North American NLP research, LLMs, discourse analysis | June 16–20, Toronto, ON, Canada | ACL's regional counterpart; strong academic paper track. |
| EACL | European Chapter of the ACL | European NLP perspectives, LLMs, ethical NLP | March 17–21, St. Julian's, Malta | Emphasizes European languages and policy in AI. |

#### Additional Insights
- **LLM-Specific Tracks**: LLMs are a hot topic across all these, with dedicated workshops (e.g., NeurIPS's "LLM Alignment" or ACL's "Generative AI"). For pure LLM focus, check sub-events like the Future of Large Language Models (FLLM) conference (dates TBD for 2025).
- **Submission Deadlines**: Use resources like [AI Deadlines](https://aideadlin.es/) for real-time updates—e.g., ICML abstract deadline is ~January 2025.
- **Why These?** These are "major" based on impact (h-index, citations) and attendance (1,000–10,000 participants). They attract top academics from institutions like Stanford, MIT, and MBZUAI.

For more details or 2026 previews, I recommend browsing the official sites. If you need info on a specific conference or region (e.g., Asia-focused), let me know!
