### Understanding Your EV Setup
It sounds like you're using your electric vehicle's (EV) electricity output port (likely a Vehicle-to-Load or V2L feature, or a similar power export capability) along with a converter (probably a DC-to-AC inverter) to generate a 220V AC power source from the car's battery. This is great for turning your EV into a mobile power station, especially for camping, emergencies, or off-grid use. Most modern EVs with V2L can output anywhere from 1.5kW to 3.6kW (depending on the model, like Kia EV6 or Hyundai Ioniq 5), which limits you to devices under that wattage to avoid overloading.

You're already planning to charge laptops (typically 50-100W) and mobile phones (5-30W), which is straightforward with standard chargers plugged into the 220V outlet. Below, I'll outline additional electronic products and devices you can power, grouped by category. I'll include approximate power requirements where relevant (check your device's label for exact specs). Always verify your EV's max output and use a high-quality converter/extension cord rated for outdoor/high-power use to stay safe.

### Essential Accessories You Might Need
To maximize usability, you may need a few additional electronic products:
- **Power Strip/Surge Protector**: A multi-outlet extension with surge protection (e.g., 220V, 10A+ rating) to connect multiple devices at once. Look for weatherproof ones if using outdoors.
- **Extension Cord**: Heavy-duty, grounded 220V cord (at least 10-15m long, 16A rating) to reach devices farther from the car.
- **Voltage Meter or Power Monitor**: A plug-in device (like a Kill-A-Watt meter) to track real-time power draw and avoid exceeding your EV's limits.
- **Adapters/Plugs**: If your converter has limited ports, get universal travel adapters for different plug types.
- **Portable Battery Pack**: A large power bank (e.g., 500Wh+) that you can charge from the car, then use elsewhere for smaller devices.

These are inexpensive (under $50 each) and available on sites like Amazon or local electronics stores.

### Other Devices You Can Power
Here's a list of practical devices, based on common V2L uses. Focus on items under 1500-3600W total to prevent battery drain or shutdowns. Start with low-power items and monitor usage.

#### Charging Electronics
- **Tablets or E-readers**: 10-20W – Easy to charge, great for travel.
- **Cameras or Drones**: 20-50W – Recharge batteries for photography/videography on the go.
- **Portable Speakers or Headphones**: 5-50W – Power Bluetooth speakers for music during picnics.
- **E-bikes or Electric Scooters**: 50-200W – Charge another small EV if it has a standard 220V charger.
- **Home Office/Entertainment**
- **Monitors or External screens**: 20-100W – Set up a mobile workspace.
- **Printers or Scanners**: 50-200W (idle/printing) – For quick document handling.
- **Gaming Consoles**: 100-300W (e.g., Nintendo Switch or portable ones; avoid high-end like PS5 at 200W+ if gaming intensely).
- **Projectors or Portable TVs**: 50-200W – Movie nights while camping.
- **Kitchen Appliances** (Small Ones)
- **Electric Kettle or Tea Maker**: 800-1500W – Boil water for drinks (use briefly to save battery).
- **Coffee Maker**: 600-1000W – Brew coffee outdoors.
- **Portable Blender or Food Processor**: 200-500W – Make smoothies or prep food.
- **Mini Fridge or Cooler**: 50-100W – Keep food/drinks during road trips (efficient for hours).
- **Toaster or Sandwich Maker**: 700-1000W – Quick snacks (short use).

#### Outdoor/Tools
- **Power Tools**: E.g., corded drill (400-800W), saw (500-1000W), or inflator pump (100-300W) – Ideal for DIY or emergencies.
- **Lights or Lanterns**: 10-100W – LED floodlights for camping or nighttime work.
- **Fans or Heaters**: 500-1500W – Portable fan for cooling or small heater (watch power draw in cold weather).
- **Vacuum Cleaner**: 500-1000W – Car or handheld models for cleaning.
- **Portable Air Compressor**: 200-400W – Inflate tires or sports gear.

#### Emergency/Utility
- **Medical Devices**: E.g., CPAP machine (50-100W) or nebulizer (100-200W) – Essential for health needs during travel or blackouts.
- **Wi-Fi Router or Modem**: 10-50W – Maintain internet access.
- **Portable Freezer**: 50-150W – Preserve perishables longer-term.
- **Sump Pump or Water Pump**: 300-800W – For flooding or water transfer in emergencies.

#### Fun/Other Ideas
- **Hair Dryer or Straightener**: 1000-1800W – Personal care (use sparingly, as it's high power).
- **Portable Washing Machine**: 200-500W – Small loads for camping.
- **Stereo or Amplifier**: 50-300W – Outdoor parties.

### Limitations and Advice
- **Power Constraints**: Total load shouldn't exceed your EV's rating (e.g., 3.6kW max on some models). High-draw devices like microwaves (1000W+) or hair dryers work but drain the battery fast—e.g., a 1kW device might run for 30-60 minutes on a 60kWh battery.
- **Safety Tips**: Use grounded plugs, avoid wet conditions, and don't run the system unattended. If your EV doesn't have built-in V2L, ensure your converter is EV-compatible (high-voltage input) to handle more power than a standard 12V socket.
- **Efficiency**: Prioritize energy-efficient devices (look for low-wattage LED or USB-C options). If you specify your EV model, I can give more precise recommendations.

This setup is a versatile feature—people use it for camping, power outages, or even powering home essentials like fridges during blackouts [1][2][3]. If you need product suggestions or troubleshooting, share more about your car!
