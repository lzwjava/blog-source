### Feasibility Overview
Directly binding an Arduino to a DJI Mini 3 to control its flight (e.g., autonomous neighborhood patrols) while simultaneously scanning WiFi signals isn't straightforward or natively supported. DJI's ecosystem is proprietary, and the Mini 3's flight controller isn't exposed for easy microcontroller integration like Arduino. However, a hybrid setup is possible with workarounds: use third-party apps for basic autonomous flight, and mount a separate Arduino-based WiFi scanner as a payload. I'll break it down step by step, including technical challenges, a viable approach, and code sketches.

### Key Challenges
- **Flight Control**: The DJI Mini 3 supports the Mobile SDK for custom apps (Android/iOS) that enable waypoint missions or virtual stick control for semi-autonomous flight. But this SDK doesn't work on embedded hardware like Arduino—it's mobile-only. There's no Onboard SDK for the Mini 3 (that's for enterprise drones like Matrice series). Hacking the flight controller (e.g., via reverse-engineering OcuSync protocol) exists for unlocks like altitude limits, but no documented Arduino integrations for full flight autonomy.
- **Hardware Binding**: You can't directly wire Arduino to the Mini 3's internals without risking damage or voiding warranty. The drone weighs under 250g for regs, so adding payload (Arduino + WiFi module) must stay light (~10-20g max to avoid issues).
- **WiFi Scanning**: This is the easy part—Arduino excels here with add-ons like ESP32.
- **Legality/Ethics**: Scanning WiFi (wardriving) via drone could violate privacy laws (e.g., FCC in US) or drone regs (VLOS required). Stick to your property or get permissions.

### Viable Approach: Hybrid Setup
1. **Autonomous Flight via App**: Use apps like Litchi, Dronelink, or DroneDeploy (via Mobile SDK) for waypoint-based flights around the neighborhood. Pre-plan a route in the app (e.g., grid pattern at 50m altitude). This handles takeoff, navigation, and return-to-home—no Arduino needed for flight.
2. **Mount Arduino as Payload**: Attach a lightweight Arduino (e.g., Nano or ESP32 board) under the drone with zip ties or 3D-printed mount. Power it from the drone's USB port or a small LiPo battery.
3. **WiFi Scanning on Arduino**: Program the ESP32 (programmable via Arduino IDE) to scan for SSIDs, RSSI (signal strength), channels, encryption, and bitrate estimates. Log data to an SD card or transmit via Bluetooth/WiFi to your phone/ground station.
4. **Synchronization**: Trigger scans periodically (e.g., every 10s) during flight. Use GPS module on Arduino (e.g., NEO-6M) to geotag scans, or sync timestamps with drone telemetry if accessible via SDK app.
5. **Total Cost/Weight**: ~$20-30 for parts; keeps under 249g total.

This way, the Arduino "accumulates" data independently while the drone flies autonomously via software.

### Sample Arduino Code for WiFi Scanner
Use an ESP32 board (it's Arduino-compatible and has built-in WiFi). Wire an SD card module for logging. Install libraries: `WiFi`, `SD`, `TinyGPS++` (for GPS if added).

```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <SD.h>
#include <TinyGPS++.h>  // Optional for GPS geotagging

// SD card chip select pin
const int chipSelect = 5;

// GPS setup (if using Serial1 for GPS module)
TinyGPSPlus gps;
HardwareSerial gpsSerial(1);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  gpsSerial.begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1, 16, 17);  // RX=16, TX=17 for GPS
  
  // Initialize SD card
  if (!SD.begin(chipSelect)) {
    Serial.println("SD Card initialization failed!");
    return;
  }
  Serial.println("WiFi Scanner Ready. Starting scans...");
}

void loop() {
  // Scan WiFi networks
  int n = WiFi.scanNetworks();
  if (n == 0) {
    Serial.println("No networks found");
  } else {
    File dataFile = SD.open("/wifi_log.txt", FILE_APPEND);
    if (dataFile) {
      dataFile.print("Scan at: " + String(millis()) + "ms | ");
      
      // Optional: Add GPS if available
      if (gpsSerial.available() > 0) {
        if (gps.encode(gpsSerial.read())) {
          if (gps.location.isValid()) {
            dataFile.print("Lat: " + String(gps.location.lat(), 6) + ", Lng: " + String(gps.location.lng(), 6) + " | ");
          }
        }
      }
      
      for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        dataFile.print("SSID: " + WiFi.SSID(i) + " | RSSI: " + String(WiFi.RSSI(i)) + "dBm | Ch: " + String(WiFi.channel(i)) + " | Enc: " + String(WiFi.encryptionType(i)) + " | ");
        // Bitrate estimate: Rough calc from RSSI (not precise, but approx)
        int bitrate = map(WiFi.RSSI(i), -100, -30, 1, 100);  // Mbps rough scale
        dataFile.print("Est Bitrate: " + String(bitrate) + "Mbps | ");
      }
      dataFile.println();
      dataFile.close();
      Serial.println("Data logged to SD");
    }
  }
  
  WiFi.scanDelete();  // Clear results
  delay(10000);  // Scan every 10 seconds (adjust for flight speed)
}
```

- **How it Works**: Scans all visible networks, logs SSID, signal strength (RSSI), channel, encryption, and a rough bitrate estimate. Add GPS for location-tied data.
- **Accumulation**: Appends to `/wifi_log.txt` on SD. Post-flight, read it on your computer for mapping (e.g., in Python with Folium).
- **Enhancements**: Add Bluetooth (HC-05) to stream live data to your phone during flight.

### Limitations & Alternatives
- **No Full Autonomy from Arduino**: If you insist on Arduino-driven flight, build a custom drone (e.g., with MultiWii firmware on Arduino) instead of hacking the Mini 3—safer and cheaper for learning.
- **Range/Safety**: Mini 3's 10km range is great, but wind/obstacles limit neighborhood flights. Test in open areas.
- **If Upgrading**: Mini 3 Pro has better SDK support for advanced missions.

This setup gets you 80% there without deep hacks. If you share more details (e.g., exact Arduino model), I can refine the code.
