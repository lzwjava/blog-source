"Breaking Bad" is a TV series that revolves around chemistry, particularly in the context of methamphetamine production, so several chemistry-related terms pop up frequently. Based on the show's themes and dialogue, here are some of the most common chemistry words and concepts that appear often:

1. **Methamphetamine** - The central focus of the show, often just called "meth." It’s the chemical compound Walter White, a former chemistry teacher, synthesizes.

2. **Methylamine** - A key precursor chemical used in Walt and Jesse’s meth production process. It’s mentioned repeatedly as they struggle to source it.

3. **Pseudoephedrine** - Another precursor Walt initially uses to make meth, commonly found in cold medications, leading to plot points about acquiring it.

4. **Phosphine** - A toxic gas that comes up early in the series when Walt uses red phosphorus and accidentally creates it, nearly killing him and Jesse.

5. **Red Phosphorus** - Used in the "P2P" (phenyl-2-propanone) method of meth synthesis, a recurring term tied to their cooking process.

6. **Hydrofluoric Acid** - Frequently referenced for dissolving bodies (like in the infamous bathtub scene). Walt’s expertise with it highlights his chemistry knowledge.

7. **Catalyst** - Walt often talks about catalysts in a literal chemical sense (e.g., in meth production) and metaphorically about his life choices.

8. **Isomer** - Specifically, Walt prides himself on creating the "d-isomer" of methamphetamine, which is more potent and pure, showcasing his skill.

9. **Blue** - While not a chemistry term itself, the blue color of Walt’s meth (due to impurities or artistic license) becomes synonymous with its chemical purity.

10. **Reaction** - A general chemistry term used both practically (in the lab) and narratively to describe volatile situations.

11. **Aluminum Amalgam** - Mentioned in the context of an alternative meth synthesis method Walt uses early on.

12. **Crystallization** - Refers to the process of forming meth crystals, a point of pride for Walt’s high-quality product.

These terms are woven into the show’s fabric, often explained by Walt in his teacher-like monologues or debated during tense moments with Jesse. They reflect the blend of real science and dramatic flair that defines "Breaking Bad." If you’d like, I could dig deeper into specific episodes or scenes for more examples!
