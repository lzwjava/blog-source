You asked how good DeepSeek V3.1 is—here’s what’s publicly known so far (as of **August 21–23, 2025**):

### What’s New in DeepSeek V3.1

* **Hybrid inference architecture ("Think & Non-Think")**: The model supports two distinct modes—a fast "non-thinking" mode for quick replies, and a more deliberate "thinking" mode for deeper reasoning and tool use. ([Reuters][1], [DeepSeek API Docs][2])
* **Faster reasoning**: The "Think" mode responds significantly faster than earlier versions like DeepSeek‑R1-0528, while maintaining high answer quality. ([DeepSeek API Docs][2])
* **Improved agent capabilities**: Post-training enhances tool usage, multi-step reasoning, and agent-like behavior. ([DeepSeek API Docs][2])
* **Expanded context window**: Still holds a very long context length of **128K tokens**, enabling it to process extensive documents. ([Hugging Face][3])

### Performance Insights

* **Benchmarks (Community-sourced)**: On Reddit, one contributor shared aggregated benchmark scores comparing DeepSeek V3.1 (Thinking) with **gpt‑oss‑120b**:

  * **Intelligence Index**: 60 vs 61
  * **Coding Index**: 59 vs 50
  * However, DeepSeek V3.1 is **much slower**—127.8 seconds versus 11.5 seconds to generate a 500-token answer, and with a much lower token output rate (20 tokens/s vs 228 tokens/s). Also, the cost for DeepSeek was significantly higher: **\$0.32 input / \$1.15 output** vs **\$0.072 / \$0.28** for gpt‑oss‑120b. ([Reddit][4])

* **Programming benchmarks**:

  * Achieved **71.6%** on the Aider programming benchmark, **surpassing Claude Opus 4**, with faster inference/response speeds. ([36Kr][5])
  * Other analysis indicates it delivers strong coding and math performance at a cost up to **98% lower** than major competitors. ([Creole Studios][6])

### Summary: Strengths and Trade-offs

* **Pros**:

  * Flexible dual-mode ("Think" vs "Non-Think") for different workloads
  * Excellent at tool use, multi-step reasoning, and coding tasks
  * Very long context support (128K tokens)

* **Cons**:

  * In "Think" mode, response latency is high (slow)
  * More expensive per token than some models like gpt-oss-120b
  * Benchmarks still emerging—some are community-driven; more official evaluations would help

In short, **DeepSeek V3.1 is a powerful upgrade** over V3 and R1, especially for complex reasoning, coding, and long-context tasks. But **its reasoning mode sacrifices speed and cost efficiency**, making it better suited for high-value applications rather than fast, budget-conscious use cases.

Would you like help comparing it directly with models like GPT-5 or Claude 4.1? Or suggestions on how to best leverage DeepSeek V3.1 based on your needs?
