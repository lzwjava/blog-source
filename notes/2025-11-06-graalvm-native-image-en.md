### What is Native Image in GraalVM?

In the context of GraalVM's introduction, **Native Image** refers to a feature that compiles Java (or other JVM-based) applications ahead-of-time (AOT) into standalone, native executable binaries. These executables run directly on the host machine without needing a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) at runtime. It's essentially a way to turn your Java code into something akin to a C/C++ native binary, but built from high-level languages like Java, Kotlin, or Scala.

#### Key Technology Behind It
- **GraalVM Compiler**: Native Image leverages the GraalVM compiler (an advanced optimizing compiler for the JVM) to perform static analysis and AOT compilation. During the build process:
  1. **Static Analysis**: It scans your entire application (including dependencies) to identify all reachable code paths, classes, methods, and resources. This creates a "closed-world" assumption, resolving dynamic behaviors at build time.
  2. **Partial Evaluation**: The compiler evaluates parts of the code symbolically (e.g., reflection, dynamic class loading) ahead of time, replacing them with optimized machine code.
  3. **Code Generation**: It generates a native executable using low-level virtual machine (LLVM) or SubstrateVM (GraalVM's embedded VM) to produce platform-specific binaries (e.g., for Linux, Windows, macOS, or even embedded systems).
  
- **SubstrateVM**: This is the core runtime underneath Native Image. It's a lightweight, embeddable VM that strips away JVM features not needed for AOT (like just-in-time compilation) and includes only what's statically linked from your app.

The result is a self-contained binary—no external JVM, no JRE installation required. Tools like `native-image` CLI or Maven/Gradle plugins handle the build.

#### Benefits and Trade-offs
- **Pros**:
  - **Instant Startup**: Milliseconds instead of seconds (great for serverless/microservices).
  - **Low Memory Footprint**: Often 1/10th of a JVM's usage.
  - **Smaller Deployment Size**: Single file, no classpath hassles.
- **Cons**:
  - **Build Time**: Can take minutes to hours for large apps due to analysis.
  - **Limited Dynamic Features**: Things like dynamic proxies or late-bound reflection need explicit configuration (via metadata files).
  - **Platform-Specific**: Binaries are tied to the build machine's OS/architecture.

This tech is popular for cloud-native apps, containers (e.g., Docker images under 50MB), and edge computing.
