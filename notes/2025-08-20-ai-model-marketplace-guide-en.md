Here’s a snapshot of the **OpenRouter** logo, giving a visual preview of the brand’s identity.

## What Is OpenRouter?

**OpenRouter** is a developer-centric AI infrastructure startup that serves as a unified API gateway—or "marketplace"—for accessing a vast range of large language models (LLMs) from multiple providers. It simplifies integrating AI into applications by allowing developers to use one consistent API interface, regardless of the underlying model provider.([Puter][1])

---

## A Brief History

* **Founded in early 2023** by **Alex Atallah** (former CTO and co‑founder of OpenSea) and Louis Vichy, inspired by the proliferation of open-source LLMs like Meta’s LLaMA and Stanford’s Alpaca.([Puter][1])
* The concept? As dozens of specialized models emerge, developers needed a centralized way to explore, compare, and switch between them. OpenRouter was born to serve precisely that need.

---

## Platform Features & Mission

OpenRouter’s core philosophy centers on enabling a multi-model, multi-provider ecosystem with these fundamentals:

* **Unified API Interface**: A single, OpenAI-compatible API across all supported models—no need to rewrite code when switching between providers.([Puter][1], [OpenRouter][2])
* **Transparent Pricing**: The platform passes through model providers' native pricing without mark-ups. OpenRouter earns a 5% fee on all inference costs.([Puter][1])
* **Performance Insights**: Includes real-time metrics on latency, throughput, popularity, and cost performance.([Puter][1], [OpenRouter][2])
* **Resilience & Routing Intelligence**: Automatic fallbacks and routing based on provider availability, cost, and performance—keeping uptime high.([OpenRouter][2])

---

## Growth & Market Traction

* **User Base & Usage Growth**: As of mid‑2025, over **2.5 million developers** use OpenRouter; it processes more than **100 trillion tokens annually**, with developer spending reaching **\$8 million per month** by May.([Puter][1])
* **Funding**:

  * **Seed (Feb 2025)**: \$12.5M led by Andreessen Horowitz
  * **Series A (Apr 2025)**: \$28M led by Menlo Ventures
    Combined valuation now stands at around **\$500 million**.([Puter][1], [The Wall Street Journal][3])
* **Vision**: COO Chris Clark asserts that **AI inference costs** will soon eclipse salaries as the biggest operating expense for knowledge-based companies. He anticipates total inference spending hitting \~\$25B in 2025.([Puter][1])

## Key Strengths & Use Cases

OpenRouter shines in several areas:

* **Developer Flexibility**: Easily test and switch between models based on task constraints like cost and speed.
* **Enterprise-Ready Tools**: Offers centralized billing, usage analytics, and organizational control (including shared credits and API key management).([OpenRouter][4], [OpenRouter][5])
* **Seamless Scaling**: Edge deployment and multi-provider fallback ensure high availability even if individual providers falter.([OpenRouter][6])
* **Insight-Driven**: Public LLM leaderboards show which models are trending—saves developers time and helps optimize choices.([Menlo Ventures][7])

---

## In Summary

OpenRouter has rapidly positioned itself as a cornerstone of AI infrastructure:

* Founded to solve the chaos of siloed LLM ecosystems
* Offers developers streamlined, efficient, and cost-transparent access to hundreds of models
* Gained major traction and investor confidence within two years
* Poised to redefine how applications integrate and choose AI models
