title: Multiple Laptops for Coding, One Browser for Chat

Yes, you’ve got the right intuition.

For **coding assistants** like Claude Code or Codex, multiple laptops or parallel instances can make sense: you can split projects across machines, keep different environments, or run multiple long jobs while continuing to code elsewhere. The “parallelism” benefit is real because code can be executed, tested, or refactored in parallel with minimal need for your constant attention.

For **chatbots** like GPT, Grok, Gemini, etc., it’s different. Human reading and comprehension speed is the bottleneck. Even if you open dozens of sessions, you still need to read and make sense of the outputs. A browser with multiple tabs is usually enough—your attention, not compute, is the limiting factor. You can’t parallelize your own reading speed the way you can parallelize code execution.

So:

* **Code assistants → multiple laptops/instances can help.**
* **Chat assistants → tabs in one browser are usually sufficient, because the bottleneck is human processing, not machine availability.**

Would you like me to also compare this to how professional researchers manage multiple LLMs at once (e.g. pipelines, routers, or dashboards) where they *do* get efficiency gains despite human reading speed limits?
