The `ENOTEMPTY` error in npm occurs when it tries to rename a directory (in this case, `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code` to `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/.claude-code-2DTsDk1V`), but the destination directory is not empty. This typically happens during package installation or updates when npm cannot overwrite or move directories due to existing files.

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Clear npm Cache**:
   Run the following command to clear the npm cache, which can resolve issues from corrupted or stale cache data:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

2. **Remove the Problematic Directory**:
   The error points to the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` directory. Delete it manually to ensure no conflicting files remain:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

3. **Check for Partial Installations**:
   Also check for the temporary directory mentioned in the error (`/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/.claude-code-2DTsDk1V`) and remove it:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/.claude-code-2DTsDk1V
   ```

4. **Reinstall the Package**:
   After clearing the problematic directories, try reinstalling the package:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Check Permissions**:
   The error could be due to insufficient permissions. Ensure you have write access to `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules`. If not, adjust permissions or use `sudo`:
   ```bash
   sudo npm install
   ```
   Alternatively, fix permissions:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules
   ```

6. **Review the Debug Log**:
   Check the log file at `/Users/lzwjava/.npm/_logs/2025-05-25T19_07_29_589Z-debug-0.log` for more details. You can view it with:
   ```bash
   cat /Users/lzwjava/.npm/_logs/2025-05-25T19_07_29_589Z-debug-0.log
   ```
   Look for additional clues about conflicting files or processes.

7. **Update npm**:
   Ensure you're using the latest version of npm to avoid bugs in older versions:
   ```bash
   npm install -g npm@latest
   ```

8. **Check for Running Processes**:
   Sometimes, a running process locks the directory. Ensure no other npm processes are active:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep npm
   ```
   If any npm processes are running, terminate them:
   ```bash
   kill -9 <process-id>
   ```

9. **Try a Fresh Install**:
   If the issue persists, consider removing the entire `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file, then reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

### Additional Notes
- If you're using a package like `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`, ensure it's compatible with your Node.js and npm versions.
- If the issue recurs, check for disk space issues or filesystem corruption on your machine.
- If you're on macOS (as suggested by `/opt/homebrew`), ensure Homebrew is up to date with `brew update` and `brew upgrade`.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, share relevant details from the debug log or any specific context about the package or command you were running.
