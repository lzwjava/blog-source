### Java Message Service (JMS) Overview
Java Message Service (JMS) is a standard API for sending messages between Java applications, enabling asynchronous communication. It supports two main messaging patterns: point-to-point (using queues) and publish-subscribe (using topics). In IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS), JMS is integrated to handle messaging within enterprise applications, often using the built-in default messaging provider or external providers like IBM MQ.

### Queues in JMS
In JMS, a **queue** is a type of destination used for **point-to-point messaging**. Here's a breakdown:
- **Purpose**: Messages sent to a queue are delivered to exactly one consumer (receiver). It's ideal for scenarios where a message needs to be processed by a single application or component, such as task distribution or request-response patterns.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**: Messages are typically processed in the order they arrive, though JMS allows for prioritization.
  - **Persistence**: Messages can be persistent (stored durably) or non-persistent, ensuring reliability in case of failures.
  - **Consumers**: Multiple consumers can be attached to a queue, but each message is consumed by only one. If no consumer is available, messages queue up until processed.
- **Components Involved**:
  - **Queue Sender/Producer**: Sends messages to the queue.
  - **Queue Receiver/Consumer**: Polls or listens for messages on the queue.
  - **Connection Factory**: Used to create connections to the JMS provider.

### Queues in IBM WebSphere Application Server
In IBM WAS, JMS queues are configured as resources within the server's messaging infrastructure. WAS supports:
- **Default Messaging Provider**: Built-in JMS engine for lightweight messaging.
- **Integration with IBM MQ**: For more robust, scalable queuing.

#### Configuration Basics
To use queues in WAS:
1. **Create a JMS Bus**: A logical grouping of servers for message routing.
2. **Add Bus Members**: Include application servers to the bus.
3. **Create Queue Destinations**: Define the queue (e.g., name, JNDI binding) and link it to the bus.
4. **Set Up Connection Factories**: For producers/consumers to connect.
5. **Activation Specs**: For message-driven beans (MDBs) to automatically consume from queues.

Queues can be monitored via the WAS admin console for depth, age, and throughput. For example, you might create a queue named `MyApp.Queue` with a JNDI name like `jms/queue/MyQueue` for lookup in code.

#### Example Use Case
In a banking app, a queue could handle transaction requests: A frontend sends a message to the queue, and a backend MDB processes it one at a time, ensuring no duplicates.

For detailed setup, refer to IBM's documentation.
