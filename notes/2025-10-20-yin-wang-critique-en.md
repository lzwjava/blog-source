### Is Yin Wang's View "True"?

Yin Wang's essay, written in late 2019, captures a sharp critique of how "success" is often pursued and celebrated in Chinese society. His core claims—that mainstream success is a conformist trap rooted in a lifelong "grading" culture, that it leads to servility to external validation, and that many celebrated tech entrepreneurs and companies are overhyped bubbles lacking real value—hold significant truth, backed by cultural patterns and economic data. However, it's not universally absolute; there are nuances, counterexamples, and evolving shifts in younger generations. I'll break it down step by step, then address how success is broadly perceived in China today.

#### 1. **The "Grading Culture" and Obsession with Comparison**
   - **Truth in the claim**: Yes, this is a well-documented aspect of Chinese society. From early childhood, the education system emphasizes high-stakes exams (e.g., gaokao), rankings, and parental/teacher evaluations, fostering a habit of external benchmarking. This extends into adulthood via workplace hierarchies, social media metrics (likes, followers), and familial expectations around marriage and career. Surveys and studies show that Chinese individuals often tie self-worth to societal approval, with "face" (mianzi) playing a central role—losing it through perceived failure can lead to intense pressure.
   - **Evidence**: Psychological research highlights how Confucian-influenced values prioritize harmony and hierarchy, but modern twists amplify materialism and competition. For instance, a 2022 study found that higher socioeconomic status in China correlates with better health outcomes in some areas but worse mental health due to comparison stress. Education remains the top "success ladder," with 99.96% literacy but fierce competition for elite spots (e.g., Tsinghua, Peking University).
   - **Nuance**: Not everyone internalizes this fully. Urban millennials and Gen Z increasingly value work-life balance and personal fulfillment over rote achievement, influenced by global trends. Wang's rejection of contests (like ACM/ICPC) echoes a growing "lying flat" (tangping) movement, where some opt out of the rat race.

#### 2. **"Success" as Slavery to External Validation**
   - **Truth in the claim**: Largely accurate for the mainstream narrative. Public "success" often means wealth, status symbols (e.g., luxury cars, big houses), and titles that command respect or flattery. Wang's disdain for sycophants rings true in guanxi-driven networks, where relationships are leveraged for advancement, sometimes at the cost of integrity. Many chase billionaire status (e.g., via startups) not for intrinsic joy but to silence critics or gain deference.
   - **Evidence**: Cultural analyses describe success as "absolute freedom" in traditional terms but corrupted by materialism in modern China—think chengyu (idioms) like "wealth and honor" as ideals. Wang's own background (Tsinghua dropout, principled rejections of lucrative offers) exemplifies resisting this, and his blog resonates with intellectuals frustrated by it.
   - **Nuance**: Genuine respect does exist beyond money; figures like Jack Ma were admired for innovation before scandals. Wang's ideal of "kindred spirits" aligns with niche communities (e.g., tech bloggers, philosophers) that prioritize ideas over applause.

#### 3. **Celebrated Tech Companies as "Bubbles" and "Toxins"**
   - **Truth in the claim**: Spot-on for many cases. China's internet sector boomed on hype, subsidies, and user growth over profits, leading to "zombie firms" and economic distortions. Numerous unicorns (e.g., in e-commerce, ride-hailing) burned cash on subsidies and price wars, contributing to debt bubbles. When they burst (e.g., 2021-2023 regulatory crackdowns), it exposed low societal value—flooding markets with low-quality content, exploiting labor, and inflating inequality.
   - **Evidence**: As of 2025, many listed Chinese firms remain unprofitable; state-owned enterprises dominate the $850B in 2023 profits, while tech startups face price wars (e.g., Alibaba, JD.com slashing margins for market share). Analyses of Tencent and Alibaba show viable models, but the sector overall has "unproductive bubbles"—over 50% of ex-unicorns are unprofitable or delisted. Government intervention keeps loss-makers afloat to preserve jobs, echoing Wang's "toxins" critique.
   - **Nuance**: Not all are failures—Alibaba and Tencent generated billions in profits by 2024. The sector has real innovations (e.g., mobile payments, AI), but Wang's point about "garbage information" holds for short-video platforms like Douyin, criticized for addiction and misinformation.

In summary, Wang's essay is "true" as a provocative mirror to systemic pressures, especially for the pre-2000s generation. It's less a universal indictment than a call to redefine success personally, which he lives out as a nomadic coder-philosopher. His words have enduring appeal: his Substack and blog still draw devoted readers who echo his anti-conformism.

### How to See Success in China's Society?

Viewing "success" in China requires layering traditional values with modern pressures. It's not monolithic—rural vs. urban, old vs. young perspectives differ—but here's a framework based on cultural, economic, and social lenses:

#### **Core Metrics of Mainstream Success**
| Dimension | Description | Examples/Why It Matters |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Education** | Top priority; seen as the great equalizer. High scores/titles from elite schools signal potential. | Gaokao rank > job offers; Tsinghua/Peking grads get guanxi boosts. 70% of workforce lacks high school, making it a rare ticket to mobility. |
| **Wealth & Materialism** | Financial security + visible status symbols. "Common prosperity" rhetoric tempers excess, but billionaires remain icons. | Property ownership, luxury brands; per capita income Gini at ~0.47 shows inequality as a success gap. |
| **Family & Harmony** | Providing for parents/spouse/kids; avoiding "face loss." Success = collective elevation. | Marriage by 30, kids in top schools; filial piety ties personal wins to family duty. |
| **Status & Network (Guanxi)** | Titles, influence, social media clout. Power over flattery. | CEO roles, WeChat circles; min_faves on posts can make/break influencers. |
| **Innovation/Impact** | For elites: Building empires (e.g., tech). But often secondary to stability. | Jack Ma-style founders admired pre-fall; now, "steady jobs" in SOEs valued amid slowdowns. |

#### **Critiques and Alternative Views**
- **The Trap Wang Describes**: Chasing these metrics can hollow out authenticity—e.g., "996" work culture (9am-9pm, 6 days/week) for unfulfilling gains. Mental health crises (e.g., rising suicides among youth) stem from this.
- **Shifting Perspectives**: Post-COVID, "involution" (neijuan: pointless competition) critiques rage online. Success now includes mental wellness, travel, or side hustles. Rural "underemployed" (500M+) highlight urban biases.
- **How to "See" It Yourself**: Engage beyond headlines—read Weibo threads on gaokao stress, analyze company filings (e.g., via CNINFO), or talk to expats/returnees. Wang advises ignoring noise: Focus on intrinsic joy, like his code-for-value ethos.

Ultimately, China's success narrative is evolving toward sustainability (e.g., Xi's "common prosperity"), but Wang's warning endures: True freedom comes from your own yardstick, not the crowd's ruler.
