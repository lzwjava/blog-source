| Application Programs |
| :------------------: |
| Language Processing System |
|   Operating System   |
| Instruction Set Architecture |
|   Computer Hardware  |

Grading instructions: 1 point for each part, the graphical representation can be arbitrary, as long as it can explain the hierarchical relationship between the parts, it is considered correct.

25. Answer: According to the basic principle of two's complement operation: $[\mathrm{A}-\mathrm{B}]_{\text{补}}=[\mathrm{A}]_{\text{补}}+$ logical NOT($[\mathrm{B}]_{\text{补}}$) (2 points)
    The logical NOT([-B] complement) is to invert [B] complement and add 1, and adding 1 is achieved by setting the lowest carry Cin of the adder to 1. (1 point)

27. Answer: Since dynamic memory relies on capacitors to store information, and the capacitor capacity is limited and there is leakage, it cannot store charge for a long time. In order to ensure that the stored information is not lost, it is necessary to periodically replenish the charge to the capacitor at a certain time interval, which is the refresh of dynamic memory. (2 points)
    Refresh cycle arrangement methods include centralized refresh (1 point), distributed refresh (1 point), and asynchronous refresh (1 point).

#### V. Calculation Questions: This section consists of 3 questions, 6 points each, for a total of 18 points.

    According to the IEEE754 single-precision floating-point format:
    Sign $\mathrm{s}=0$, the real number is a positive number, the mantissa decimal part $\mathrm{f}=(0.0100101) 2 (1$ point $)$
    Exponent $\mathrm{e}=(\mathrm{1} 0000011) 2=(\mathrm{131}) 10(1$ point $)$ , the restored exponent is $\mathrm{e}-127=131-127=4$ (1 point), so the floating-point number is:
    $(1.0100101) 2 \times 2^{4}=(10100.101) 2=20.625$ (2 points)

29. Solution: $[-115]_{0}=10001101 \mathrm{~B},[-100]_{0}=10011100 \mathrm{~B}, \quad[100]_{0}=01100100 \mathrm{~B}$

    Among them, the 2nd and 3rd lines can be completed in one clock cycle or each occupy one clock cycle.

32. Answer: (1) Main memory space 1 M bytes $=2^{20}$ bytes, so the main memory address has 20 bits, Cache has $32 \mathrm{~kB} / 512 \mathrm{~B}=64$ lines, every 4 lines are in 1 group, there are $64 / 4=16$ groups, so the group number needs 4 bits to represent.

    Block address 9 bits: $\mathrm{A}_{8} \sim \mathrm{A}_{9} \quad(2$ points $)$
    Cache group number 4 bits: $\mathrm{A}_{12} \sim \mathrm{A}_{9} \quad(2$ points $)$
