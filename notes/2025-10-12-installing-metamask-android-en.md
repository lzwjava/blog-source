### How to Install MetaMask on Android

MetaMask is a popular cryptocurrency wallet app for managing Ethereum and other blockchain assets. Installing it on Android is straightforward via the Google Play Store. Here's a step-by-step guide based on the official instructions:

1. **Open the Google Play Store**: Launch the Play Store app on your Android device.

2. **Search for MetaMask**: In the search bar at the top, type "MetaMask" and hit search.

3. **Verify the Official App**: 
   - Look for the app developed by **Consensys Software Inc.** (the official publisher).
   - It should have over 10 million downloads and around 50K+ ratings.
   - The app icon is a fox with an orange background.
   - **Important Security Note**: Be cautious of fake apps! Scammers create clones that can steal your wallet info. Only download from the official listing. If in doubt, visit the official MetaMask website (metamask.io/download) and tap the Google Play link.

4. **Install the App**: Tap **Install** and wait for the download to complete (file size is about 100-150 MB, depending on your device).

5. **Open and Set Up**:
   - Launch the MetaMask app.
   - Choose **Create a New Wallet** (or **Import Wallet** if you have an existing one).
   - Follow the prompts: Agree to terms, create a strong password, and back up your **Secret Recovery Phrase** (write it down offline and store securely—never share it!).
   - Once set up, you can add funds by buying crypto via the app, receiving transfers, or importing from exchanges.

#### Tips:
- **Built-in Browser**: The app includes a dApp browser for interacting with Web3 sites directly on mobile—use this instead of external browsers for seamless connections.
- **No Browser Extension on Mobile**: Unlike desktop, Android doesn't support browser extensions like Chrome's MetaMask add-on. The standalone app handles everything.
- **Troubleshooting**: If the app crashes or won't install, ensure your Android OS is version 7.0 or higher, clear Play Store cache, or restart your device.
- **Updates**: Enable auto-updates in the Play Store to stay secure with the latest features.
