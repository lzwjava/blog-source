title: Why Soak Rice Noodles
translated: false
---

Here’s why rice noodles (or rice vermicelli) need to be soaked before cooking:

### 1. **Softens the Texture**
Dry rice noodles are hard and brittle. Soaking them in water softens the texture, making them chewy and tender when cooked. This also prevents them from breaking apart during cooking.

### 2. **Reduces Cooking Time**
Soaked noodles cook faster and more evenly, ensuring they’re fully tender without being mushy on the outside and hard inside.

### 3. **Removes Impurities**
Soaking helps rinse off excess starch or dust from the surface, making the noodles cleaner.

#### **Tips for Soaking Rice Noodles**
- **Water Temperature**: Use warm water (40–60°C or 104–140°F) to soak. Avoid boiling water, as it can make the noodles too soft or sticky.
- **Time**: Soak for 10–20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the noodles.
- **Water Ratio**: Use just enough water to cover the noodles. Drain well before cooking to avoid sogginess.

If you’re stir-frying the noodles, make sure to drain them thoroughly to prevent a mushy or sticky dish. What’s your favorite rice noodle dish? 😊
