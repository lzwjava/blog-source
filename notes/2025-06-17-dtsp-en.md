The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has issued **Guidelines on Licensing for Digital Token Service Providers (DTSPs)** under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2022 (FSM Act), effective **June 30, 2025**. These guidelines outline the licensing framework, eligibility criteria, application procedures, and ongoing compliance obligations for entities providing digital token services in Singapore. Below is a summary based on available information:

### Key Points of the Guidelines:
1. **Scope of Regulation**:
   - The guidelines apply to DTSPs under Part 9 of the FSM Act, targeting entities providing digital token services, particularly those serving customers outside Singapore.
   - Digital tokens include digital payment tokens and tokens representing capital market products. Services involving utility or governance tokens are not regulated under this regime.[](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/mas-clarifies-regulatory-regime-for-digital-token-service-providers)
   - DTSPs serving customers in Singapore are already regulated under existing frameworks like the Payment Services Act 2019, Securities and Futures Act 2001, or Financial Advisers Act 2001.[](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/mas-clarifies-regulatory-regime-for-digital-token-service-providers)

2. **Licensing Requirements**:
   - **Mandatory Licensing**: Any entity conducting digital token services in Singapore must obtain a DTSP license unless exempted.[](https://legait.ai/blog/mas-dtsp-licensing-guidelines/)
   - **Eligibility Criteria**:
     - **Governance and Ownership**: Entities must be registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and comply with governance structures outlined in Appendix 1.[](https://legait.ai/blog/mas-dtsp-licensing-guidelines/)
     - **Fit and Proper Criteria**: Key individuals (e.g., directors, partners) must meet MAS’s standards for honesty, integrity, competence, and financial soundness as per Guidelines on Fit and Proper Criteria [FSG-G01].[](https://legait.ai/blog/mas-dtsp-licensing-guidelines/)
     - **Key Personnel Competence**: Senior management must have relevant experience in digital token services and understand Singapore’s regulatory framework.[](https://legait.ai/blog/mas-dtsp-licensing-guidelines/)
     - **Physical Presence**: A permanent place of business or registered office in Singapore is required, with at least one staff member available for inquiries.[](https://legait.ai/blog/mas-dtsp-licensing-guidelines/)
     - **Capital Requirements**: A minimum base capital of SGD 250,000 is required, with buffers to cover 6–12 months of operational expenses.[](https://legait.ai/blog/mas-dtsp-licensing-guidelines/)
   - **Application Process**: Applicants must submit a legal opinion from a reputable law firm assessing whether their services fall under regulated digital token services. Upon receiving In-Principle Approval (IPA), an independent external auditor must assess technology and cybersecurity risk frameworks.[](https://legait.ai/blog/mas-dtsp-licensing-guidelines/)

3. **Compliance Obligations**:
   - **AML/CFT Compliance**: DTSPs must adhere to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations, including FSM Regulations, the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act 2002, and MAS notices (e.g., FSM-N27, FSM-N28).[](https://legait.ai/blog/mas-dtsp-licensing-guidelines/)
   - **Regulatory Reporting**: Periodic reports on digital token activities must be submitted as per FSM-N29.[](https://legait.ai/blog/mas-dtsp-licensing-guidelines/)
   - **Cybersecurity and Technology Risk Management**: DTSPs must comply with cybersecurity requirements (FSM-N31) and Technology Risk Management Guidelines, including penetration testing and remediation of high-risk findings.[](https://legait.ai/blog/mas-dtsp-licensing-guidelines/)[](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/perspectives/2024/10/expanding-the-territorial-scope-of-singapore-digital-asset-regulation)
   - **Conduct Requirements**: DTSPs must maintain robust compliance programs proportional to their business’s nature and complexity.[](https://legait.ai/blog/mas-dtsp-licensing-guidelines/)

4. **Territorial Scope and Impact**:
   - From June 30, 2025, DTSPs serving only customers outside Singapore must be licensed or cease operations, addressing risks like money laundering and terrorism financing that could harm Singapore’s reputation.[](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/mas-clarifies-regulatory-regime-for-digital-token-service-providers)[](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/perspectives/2024/10/expanding-the-territorial-scope-of-singapore-digital-asset-regulation)
   - MAS adopts a cautious approach, granting licenses in limited circumstances, evaluating applications based on business model viability, compliance with international standards, and regulatory compliance structure.[](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/perspectives/2024/10/expanding-the-territorial-scope-of-singapore-digital-asset-regulation)
   - Existing DTSPs serving only non-Singapore customers were notified to wind down activities if unlicensed, with a small number affected based on MAS’s outreach.[](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/mas-clarifies-regulatory-regime-for-digital-token-service-providers)

5. **Application and Transition**:
   - The DTSP framework supplements existing regulations (e.g., Payment Services Act) and was proposed in a 2020 consultation, with details finalized in 2024–2025.[](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/perspectives/2024/10/expanding-the-territorial-scope-of-singapore-digital-asset-regulation)
   - Applications are reviewed case-by-case, considering factors like economic sense, compliance, and risk management.[](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/perspectives/2024/10/expanding-the-territorial-scope-of-singapore-digital-asset-regulation)
   - The consultation for the framework closed on November 4, 2024, with final guidelines published by May 30, 2025.[](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/mas-clarifies-regulatory-regime-for-digital-token-service-providers)[](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/perspectives/2024/10/expanding-the-territorial-scope-of-singapore-digital-asset-regulation)

### Additional Context:
- **MAS’s Rationale**: The framework aims to mitigate risks from DTSPs with limited Singapore nexus operating abroad, which could be misused for illicit purposes.[](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/perspectives/2024/10/expanding-the-territorial-scope-of-singapore-digital-asset-regulation)
- **Sentiment on X**: Posts indicate concern about the strict regulatory stance, with some viewing it as the end of Singapore’s “crypto paradise” era, citing potential fines (SGD 250,000) and imprisonment (up to 3 years) for non-compliance.[](https://x.com/hannesgao/status/1933130255117779146)[](https://x.com/web3caff_zh/status/1932634785719148798)
- **Implementation**: No transition period is provided, emphasizing immediate compliance by June 30, 2025.[](https://x.com/hannesgao/status/1933130255117779146)
