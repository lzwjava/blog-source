Robert Harper is a highly respected computer scientist and Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where he has been on faculty since 1988. He earned his Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the California Institute of Technology in 1980 and his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell University in 1985, where his academic advisor was Robert Lee Constable. Prior to his position at Carnegie Mellon, he was a research fellow at the University of Edinburgh.

Harper is widely recognized for his significant contributions to the field of programming languages, particularly in areas such as:

* **Type Theory:** He is a leading expert in type theory, which explores the mathematical foundations of types in programming languages. His work emphasizes the interplay between types, terms, and proofs, a concept he refers to as "Computational Trinitarianism," seeing them as interconnected facets of a unified theory for understanding and formalizing computation.
* **Logical Frameworks:** He has made major contributions to the development of logical frameworks, which provide formal systems for representing and reasoning about logics.
* **Programming Language Design:** Harper played a crucial role in the design of the Standard ML programming language, a formally defined functional programming language that has influenced many others. He has also contributed to the theory and design of other functional programming languages like Haskell.
* **Formal Methods:** His research applies formal methods, including type theory and operational semantics, to the design, specification, implementation, and verification of modern programming languages. He aims to establish a comprehensive framework for analyzing a broad range of ideas in programming languages, striving to advance language design from a "trade-craft" to a rigorous discipline.

Harper is the author of the influential textbook "Practical Foundations of Programming Languages," which serves as a comprehensive resource on the theory and practice of programming languages, emphasizing the central role of type structure. He has also authored numerous papers and lecture notes on topics such as type systems for programming languages and programming in Standard ML.

His expertise extends beyond academia, as he has collaborated with industry professionals at companies like Mozilla Research and Galois Inc., applying programming language theory to real-world problems.

Robert Harper's significant contributions have been recognized with numerous accolades, including being named an ACM Fellow in 2005 for his work on type systems, receiving the ACM SIGPLAN Most Influential PLDI Paper Award in 2006, the LICS Test of Time Award in 2007, and the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Achievement Award in 2021. He has also received internal awards at Carnegie Mellon, such as the Allen Newell Award for Research Excellence and the Herbert A. Simon Award for Teaching Excellence in Computer Science.
