That's a significant amount of sugar for a 355 ml (approximately 12 US fluid ounces) can.

To put it in perspective:

* The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting added sugars to no more than 6 teaspoons (25 grams) per day for most women and 9 teaspoons (36 grams) per day for most men.
* This single can exceeds the daily recommended limit for most women and is very close to the limit for most men.

Consuming drinks with this much sugar regularly can contribute to various health issues, including:

* Weight gain
* Increased risk of type 2 diabetes
* Increased risk of heart disease
* Dental problems

It's generally advisable to choose beverages with lower or no added sugar content.
