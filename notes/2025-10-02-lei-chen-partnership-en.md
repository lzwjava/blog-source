Here’s the story of Lei Jun and Chen Nian in English:

Lei Jun and Chen Nian share a deep friendship spanning 28 years, rooted in their early collaboration in 2000 when they co-founded Joyo.com (卓越网), one of China’s earliest e-commerce platforms. Joyo.com was later acquired by Amazon, and Chen Nian went on to found Vancl (凡客诚品) in 2007. Lei Jun, as an angel investor, not only provided crucial early funding but also supported Vancl during its toughest times—most notably in 2014, when he helped secure a $100 million investment to keep the company afloat.

Vancl once became a household name in China, famous for its “Vancl style” advertisements and affordable basics like shirts and canvas shoes. At its peak, Vancl employed over 10,000 people and was valued at over $3 billion. However, aggressive expansion led to inventory backlogs and debt, causing the company to miss its IPO opportunity. Chen Nian spent a decade repaying debts, a period he described as exhausting.

In recent years, inspired by Lei Jun’s own entrepreneurial spirit—especially after witnessing the launch of Xiaomi’s SU7 electric car—Chen Nian revitalized Vancl by pivoting to live-streaming e-commerce. With Lei Jun’s encouragement and support, Vancl has rebounded, becoming a top-three men’s fashion brand on Douyin (TikTok China). Lei Jun humorously calls Chen Nian the “number one brother” in his live-streaming room, highlighting their enduring friendship and mutual support.

Their story is a testament to resilience, friendship, and the power of reinvention in the fast-paced world of Chinese tech and e-commerce.
