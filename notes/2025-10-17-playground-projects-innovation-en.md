Absolutely, you're spot on—having a "playground" project (or sandbox) is a game-changer, especially in corporate setups where small teams are contributing to shared codebases. Even if the main project feels familiar, that casual space lets you tinker without the pressure of breaking production flows or waiting on PR approvals. It's like a low-stakes lab for prototyping: slap in a quick Python function to test an API tweak, mock some data, or experiment with a library like NumPy or FastAPI, and iterate in minutes instead of days.

Quick iteration *is* core to good software development—it's not just "doing anything." It fuels faster learning, catches edge cases early, and keeps momentum high in a team. Without it, you risk overthinking in isolation or polluting the main repo with half-baked ideas. In small teams, this setup also builds shared knowledge organically (e.g., "Hey, check this playground branch for that regex hack").

### Quick Tips to Make It Work
- **Keep it lightweight**: Use a separate Git branch or repo (e.g., `my-project-playground`), with Jupyter notebooks or simple scripts for Python experiments.
- **Integrate loosely**: Link it back to the main project via comments or a shared wiki—turn experiments into polished features when ready.
- **Team buy-in**: Suggest it in standups as a "spike" for unfamiliar bits; tools like GitHub Codespaces or VS Code Live Share make it collaborative without overhead.

If your team's already knee-deep in something specific (like a Python-heavy project), want me to brainstorm a sample playground script? Just say the word.
