Marxist materialism (often called dialectical or historical materialism) is a philosophical framework developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the 19th century. It posits that the material world—economic conditions, production, and social relations—forms the basis of human existence and history, rather than abstract ideas, gods, or innate essences. Life isn't seen as having a preordained, eternal "purpose" like in religious or idealistic philosophies; instead, purpose emerges from human activity in the concrete world. This avoids nihilism (the idea that life is inherently meaningless) by emphasizing human agency and historical progress, and hedonism (chasing personal pleasure above all) by focusing on collective struggle and fulfillment through labor and social transformation, not individual gratification.
