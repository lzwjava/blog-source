### Understanding Refractive Indices in Eyeglass Lenses: 1.56, 1.60, and 1.67

The numbers 1.56, 1.60, and 1.67 refer to the **refractive index** (often just called "lens index") of the material used in eyeglass lenses. This is a measure of how efficiently the lens material bends light to correct your vision. A higher refractive index means the lens can bend light more effectively, allowing for **thinner and lighter lenses**—especially important for stronger prescriptions where lenses would otherwise become bulky.

Here's a quick breakdown of each:

| Lens Index | Common Use Case | Thickness Benefit | Typical Prescription Range |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **1.56**  | Standard plastic lenses (e.g., polycarbonate alternatives) | Baseline thickness; good for everyday wear | Low to moderate (up to about -4.00 to -6.00 diopters for myopia) |
| **1.60**  | Mid-index lenses (e.g., Trivex or improved plastic) | About 15-20% thinner than 1.56 | Moderate (around -4.00 to -8.00 diopters) |
| **1.67**  | High-index lenses (e.g., advanced polycarbonate) | 30-50% thinner than 1.56; up to 40% thinner than standard for high prescriptions | High/strong (over -6.00 to -10.00+ diopters) |

These indices are for **single-vision lenses** (correcting one field of vision). Higher indices like 1.67 are pricier and may have slightly more chromatic aberration (color fringing), but coatings can minimize this.

#### Why 1.67 Is Associated with High or "Deep" Myopia
A 1.67 index **doesn't "mean" high myopia**—myopia (nearsightedness) is defined by your prescription strength in diopters (e.g., -6.00 or higher is considered high myopia). Instead, it's **recommended *for* high/deep myopia** because:

- **Strong negative prescriptions** (like -8.00) require lenses that curve more at the edges to focus light properly, making them thick and heavy with standard materials (e.g., 1.56 index).
- A higher index like 1.67 bends light sharper, so the lens doesn't need as much material to achieve the same correction. This results in **thinner edges** (up to half the thickness of a 1.50 index lens for the same prescription), reducing weight, distortion, and the "coke-bottle" look.

In short: For mild myopia (-2.00), a 1.56 lens is fine and affordable. But for deep myopia (-7.00+), 1.67 (or even 1.74) makes the glasses practical and stylish by keeping them slim.

#### How It Makes Thinner Eyeglasses
- **Physics basics**: Light bends more in denser materials (higher index = denser). For myopia, the lens diverges light; a high-index material does this with less bulk.
- **Example**: At -5.00 diopters, a 1.56 lens might be 4mm thick at the edge, while 1.67 could be ~2.5mm—noticeably slimmer and lighter.
- **Trade-offs**: Higher indices can be more brittle and reflective (anti-reflective coatings help), but they're ideal if comfort and aesthetics matter.

If your prescription is known, an optician can recommend the best index. Always get a professional fitting for the thinnest possible result.
