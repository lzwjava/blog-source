### Major New Features in Python 3.14

Python 3.14, released on October 7, 2025, brings significant enhancements focused on performance, concurrency, debugging, and developer experience. Here's a summary of the key additions:

- **Deferred Evaluation of Annotations (PEP 649 & PEP 749)**: Function, class, and module annotations are now deferred by default, improving startup time and eliminating the need for string-based forward references. Use the new `annotationlib` module to inspect them in various formats.

- **Multiple Interpreters Support (PEP 734)**: The `concurrent.interpreters` module enables running isolated Python interpreters within the same process for better parallelism without the GIL. Includes `concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor` for easy pooling.

- **Template String Literals (PEP 750)**: Introduce "t-strings" (e.g., `t"Hello {name}"`) that create `string.templatelib.Template` objects, allowing flexible processing of interpolated strings for tasks like sanitization or custom rendering.

- **Safe External Debugger Interface (PEP 768)**: Zero-overhead attachment for debuggers to running processes via `sys.remote_exec()`, with security controls. Great for production debugging without restarts.

- **Experimental Tail-Call Interpreter**: A new opcode dispatch using small C functions instead of a switch statement, offering 3-5% speedups on supported platforms (Clang 19+). Enable with `--with-tail-call-interp`.

- **Free-Threaded Python Maturity (PEP 703)**: Official support for GIL-free builds, with reduced single-threaded overhead (5-10%) and better C API stability. Includes context-aware warnings for threading.

- **Zstandard Compression (PEP 784)**: New `compression.zstd` module for high-performance compression, integrated into `tarfile`, `zipfile`, and `shutil`.

- **Asyncio Introspection Tools**: CLI commands like `python -m asyncio ps PID` and `python -m asyncio pstree PID` to visualize running tasks, detect cycles, and debug async issues.

- **Incremental Garbage Collection**: Cycle GC now runs incrementally across two generations, drastically reducing pause times for large heaps.

- **Enhanced REPL**: Default syntax highlighting and import auto-completion (e.g., `import co<Tab>` suggests `collections`).

Other notable improvements include better error messages (e.g., keyword suggestions, async/sync mismatches), stricter regex rules, and optimizations like 10-20% faster asyncio and up to 6x faster `base64.b16decode`.
