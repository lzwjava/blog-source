Enrico Fermi, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist known for his work on nuclear reactions and quantum theory, left behind several insightful and witty quotes. Here are some of his most notable ones:

- "Before I came here I was confused about this subject. Having listened to your lecture, I am still confused. But on a higher level."
- "Whatever Nature has in store for mankind, unpleasant as it may be, men must accept, for ignorance is never better than knowledge."
- "There are two possible outcomes: If the result confirms the hypothesis, then you've made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you've made a discovery."
- "If I could remember the names of all these particles, I'd be a botanist."
- "Where are they?" (His famous question about extraterrestrial life, sparking the Fermi Paradox.)
- "I cannot think of a single one, not even intelligence." (When asked what characteristics Nobel Prize-winning physicists have in common.)
- "It is no good to try to stop knowledge from going forward. Ignorance is never better than knowledge."
