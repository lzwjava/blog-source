You're onto something intriguing here—it's a spicy take on how AI might reshape our digital workflows, and yeah, there's a kernel of truth to it that aligns with some emerging trends. But let's unpack this prediction step by step, because while I see the appeal of a text/code-first world, I don't think GUIs are headed for the scrap heap quite as fast as that. Instead, we're likely in for a hybrid evolution where both coexist, with AI supercharging the command-line and script-heavy side. I'll explain why, drawing on current vibes in dev communities and AI hype.

### Why Your Prediction Feels Spot-On for the "Text/Code Renaissance"
- **AI as the Great Equalizer for CLI and Scripts**: Tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or even xAI's own Grok are already making it dead simple to generate, debug, and iterate on code snippets right in your terminal or IDE. Why click through a bloated GUI for an API test when you can `pip install requests` and whip up a script in seconds? In the next decade, as LLMs get even better at handling natural language prompts for code (e.g., "Write a script to query my Postgres DB and alert on anomalies"), engineers will lean harder into this. It's faster, more portable, and version-control friendly—no more wrestling with proprietary UIs that lock you into one ecosystem.
  
- **Python's Dominance and Open-Source Explosion**: Python's already the lingua franca of AI/ML, data wrangling, and automation, and that's only accelerating. Packages like Pandas, FastAPI, or even niche ones for iOS/Android scripting (e.g., via Frida or Appium) let you prototype anything from a quick ETL pipeline to a mobile automation bot without leaving your terminal. Open-source tools (think Jupyter, VS Code extensions, or tmux) thrive here because they're modular and AI-amenable—feed a prompt to an AI, get a tweak, and boom, your script evolves. Predictions from dev surveys suggest Python usage could double in enterprise by 2030, fueled exactly by this script-happy mindset.

- **The Engineer’s Delight: Low-Friction Building**: Spot on about those everyday scripts. In an AI era, why boot up a full IDE for a one-off database query when `psycopg2` + a Copilot-suggested script does it in a REPL? Same for API testing (Pytest + HTTPX), iOS tinkering (via PyObjC or shortcuts), or Android automation (uiautomator2). It's empowering—turns every engineer into a mini-DevOps wizard, reducing dependency on drag-and-drop tools that often hide the "how" behind shiny buttons.

This shift feels inevitable because text/code is AI's native tongue. GUIs? They're visual sugar, great for non-devs or complex viz, but they add latency and opacity in a world where AI can "see" and manipulate code directly.

### But Hold Up—GUIs Aren't Doomed (Yet)
That said, declaring GUIs obsolete in 10 years might be a tad optimistic (or pessimistic, depending on your GUI aversion). Here's the counter-narrative:
- **AI Will Reinvent GUIs, Not Kill Them**: Think adaptive interfaces—AI-powered UIs that morph based on your intent, blending the best of both worlds. Tools like Figma's AI plugins or Adobe's Firefly already hint at this: natural language + visual editing. In 10 years, your "GUI" might be a dynamic canvas where you describe "Build me a dashboard for sales data" and it auto-generates the code underneath, with a toggle to dive into the terminal view. No obsolescence; just evolution.
  
- **Human Factors and Scale**: Not every task is script-friendly. For collaborative design (e.g., UI/UX prototyping) or non-technical users (marketers tweaking campaigns), GUIs win on accessibility. And as apps scale to billions (hello, consumer AI like personalized AR/VR), point-and-click will stick around for sanity's sake. Devs might script the backend, but frontends? Still GUI-heavy.

- **Hybrid Tools Are the Real Future**: IDEs like VS Code are already "GUIs for code," bridging the gap with extensions for terminals, previews, and AI autocompletion. Terminals get graphical too (e.g., Warp or Fig.io). The popularity boom you predict? Absolutely—for power users. But for the masses, it'll be seamless blends, not a full purge.

In short, right on the money for why Python/CLI/open-source will surge: it's direct, AI-native, and engineer-empowering. But GUIs? They'll slim down and smarten up, not vanish. The next 10 years could see a "script-first" ethos dominate dev work, making us all a bit more like wizardly terminal jockeys. What do you think—got a specific script workflow you're eyeing for this shift?
