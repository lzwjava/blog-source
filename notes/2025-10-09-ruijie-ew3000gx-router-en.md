The Ruijie EW3000GX (full model: RG-EW3000GX) is a high-performance Wi-Fi 6 router from Ruijie Networks, sold under their consumer-friendly Reyee brand. It's designed for home use, delivering dual-band wireless speeds up to 3000 Mbps (AX3000 class: 574 Mbps on 2.4 GHz + 2402 Mbps on 5 GHz). Key features include:

- **Dual-WAN aggregation**: Combines two internet connections (e.g., fiber + mobile hotspot) for faster, more reliable speeds and automatic failover.
- **Gigabit ports**: Four LAN ports plus one WAN port, all supporting up to 1 Gbps wired connections.
- **Wi-Fi coverage**: Five high-gain antennas ensure strong signal penetration and full coverage for large apartments or multi-room homes, with support for 160 MHz channel width for better throughput.
- **Mesh networking**: Compatible with Reyee's mesh system for seamless whole-home Wi-Fi expansion.
- **Smart features**: Free cloud management app for setup, parental controls, guest networks, and QoS (Quality of Service) to prioritize gaming or streaming. It also includes security like WPA3 encryption.
- **Gaming perks**: Low-latency mode, game acceleration, and bandwidth prioritization make it suitable for online gaming (a "PRO" variant adds even more eSports tools).

It's praised for value in real-world tests, like better wall penetration than some competitors in multi-room setups. Priced affordably (around $50–$80 depending on region), it's ideal for households with multiple devices.
