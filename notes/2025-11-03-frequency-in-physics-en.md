### Frequency in Physics and Waves
Frequency refers to the number of times a periodic event (like a wave cycle or vibration) repeats in a given unit of time. It's a fundamental concept in physics, especially for describing waves, oscillations, and signals.

- **Key Formula**: Frequency \\( f \\) is the reciprocal of the period \\( T \\) (the time for one complete cycle):  
  \\[
  f = \frac{1}{T}
  \\]
  For example, if a wave completes 5 cycles in 1 second, \\( f = 5 \\) Hz.

- **Unit**: Hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second. Higher frequencies mean faster oscillations (e.g., high-pitched sounds or visible light colors like violet).

Common examples:
- **Sound**: Human hearing ranges from ~20 Hz (low bass) to ~20,000 Hz (high treble).
- **Light**: Visible light frequencies are around \\( 4 \times 10^{14} \\) to \\( 7.5 \times 10^{14} \\) Hz.
- **AC Electricity**: Standard wall outlets in the US operate at 60 Hz.

### Frequency in Statistics and Data
In statistics, frequency is the count of how often a particular value or event appears in a dataset.
- **Absolute Frequency**: Raw count (e.g., the number "7" appears 3 times).
- **Relative Frequency**: Proportion (e.g., 3/10 = 0.3, or 30%).
- Used in histograms or frequency tables to summarize data distributions.

### Other Contexts
- **Probability**: The proportion of times an event occurs in repeated trials (approaching true probability as trials increase).
- **Telecommunications**: Radio frequency (RF) bands, like FM radio at 88–108 MHz (megahertz).

If this isn't the context you meant (e.g., a specific app, brand, or technical term), provide more details for a tailored explanation!
