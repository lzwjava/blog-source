The speed of light, denoted by $c$, is a fundamental constant in the universe, but it's crucial to understand the context in which it is considered constant.

According to Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, the speed of light **in a vacuum** is indeed constant for all inertial observers, regardless of their own motion or the motion of the light source. This is a cornerstone of special relativity and has been extensively verified by experiments. No matter how fast you are moving, if you measure the speed of light in empty space, you will always get the same value, approximately 299,792,458 meters per second.

However, the speed of light is **not** always $c$ when it travels through a medium other than a vacuum, such as air, water, or glass. When light enters a medium, it interacts with the atoms and molecules within that medium, which causes it to slow down. The speed of light in a medium is always less than $c$ and is dependent on the properties of the medium. This phenomenon is why light bends when it passes from one medium to another (refraction).

Therefore, to directly answer your question:

* The speed of light **in a vacuum** is always $c$ for any inertial observer, no matter their motion.
* The speed of light **in a medium** is less than $c$ and varies depending on the medium.
