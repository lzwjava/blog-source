title: Fix Bundler Permission Errors

### Understanding the Error

This is a common permission issue when using Bundler (Ruby's dependency manager) with a system-installed Ruby (version 3.2.0 here). The error occurs because Bundler is trying to download and cache the `rake` gem (and potentially others) in the system-wide gem directory at `/var/lib/gems/3.2.0/cache/`, which requires root-level write access. Your Bundler itself is installed user-locally (in `~/.local/share/gem/`), but it's defaulting to the system's gem paths for installations.

This chain in your `Gemfile` (Jekyll + dependencies like `minima`, `jekyll-feed`, etc.) is just triggering the install of `rake` as a deep dependency—nothing wrong with your setup, just permissions.

### Quick Fixes (in order of recommendation)

1. **Install Gems Locally (Recommended - No Sudo Needed)**  
   This keeps everything in your home directory, avoiding system paths entirely. Run:
   ```
   bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
   bundle install
   ```
   - This creates a `vendor/bundle` folder in your project for gems.
   - To run your Jekyll site later, use `bundle exec jekyll serve` (the `exec` ensures it uses the local gems).
   - If you want this global for all projects: Replace `--local` with `--global` and use `~/.bundle` as the path.

2. **Use Sudo (Quick but Not Ideal)**  
   If you need a one-off install and don't mind system-wide gems:
   ```
   sudo bundle install
   ```
   - **Warning**: This installs gems globally as root, which can lead to ownership issues later (e.g., you'd need `sudo` for future updates). Avoid if possible.

3. **Fix System Permissions (Advanced - Use with Caution)**  
   If you want to keep using the system gem dir without sudo:
   ```
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/lib/gems/3.2.0/
   ```
   - Then retry `bundle install`.
   - **Warning**: This changes ownership of system gems, which could break packages managed by your distro (e.g., Ubuntu). Only do this if you're comfortable troubleshooting.

### Long-Term Recommendation
For Ruby/Jekyll development, switch to a user-managed Ruby installer like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [RVM](https://rvm.io/). This avoids all permission headaches by installing Ruby and gems entirely in your home dir:
- Install rbenv: Follow the [official guide](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation).
- Then: `rbenv install 3.2.0 && rbenv global 3.2.0 && gem install bundler`.
- Retry `bundle install`—it'll work seamlessly.

If none of these resolve it or you hit another error, share the output of `ruby -v`, `gem env`, and your `Gemfile.lock` (if it exists) for more tailored help!
