Yes, even if two people share a lot online and learn from each other, trust still takes time to develop. Trust isn’t just about the amount of information exchanged — it’s about how that information is handled and whether actions consistently align with words.

Here are some key points:

**1. Consistency over time**
Trust builds when someone repeatedly shows up in a reliable way. That might mean replying when they say they will, keeping confidences, or staying respectful even when disagreements arise. A single positive interaction can spark connection, but trust requires a pattern.

**2. Alignment of words and actions**
It’s not just what someone says, but how their behavior backs it up. If promises are followed through and values are lived out, the bond becomes more credible.

**3. Vulnerability and small risks**
Trust deepens gradually when people take small risks — sharing personal experiences, admitting mistakes, or asking for help — and those risks are met with care rather than exploitation.

**4. Time as a filter**
Even if the internet accelerates learning and connection, time filters out inconsistencies. Over weeks or months, you get to see if the other person acts the same when things are easy versus when they’re stressful.

**5. Shared experiences**
Doing things together (even virtually — like building a project, collaborating, or solving a problem) often strengthens trust faster than just exchanging ideas, because it tests reliability in practice.

So yes, no matter how rich the conversations are, patience is essential. Trust isn’t built in a burst — it’s a slow layering of proof.

Would you like me to also give you some **practical steps** to consciously build trust in an online friendship or collaboration?
