Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly develop, test, and prototype Spring Boot applications directly from the command line. It’s especially useful for running Groovy scripts without setting up a full project structure, generating new projects, or experimenting with Spring Boot features. Below is a complete guide on how to install and use Spring Boot CLI effectively.

---

## Installation
Before you can use Spring Boot CLI, you need to install it. There are two primary methods depending on your operating system:

### 1. Using SDKMAN! (Recommended for Unix-based Systems like Linux or macOS)
SDKMAN! is a tool for managing software development kits, making it an easy way to install Spring Boot CLI.

- **Step 1: Install SDKMAN!**
  Open your terminal and run:
  ```bash
  curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
  ```
  Follow the prompts to initialize SDKMAN! by sourcing the script:
  ```bash
  source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
  ```

- **Step 2: Install Spring Boot CLI**
  Run the following command:
  ```bash
  sdk install springboot
  ```

### 2. Manual Installation (For Windows or Manual Setup)
If you’re on Windows or prefer manual installation:
- Download the Spring Boot CLI ZIP file from the [official Spring website](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
- Extract the ZIP file to a directory of your choice.
- Add the `bin` directory from the extracted folder to your system’s PATH environment variable.

### Verify Installation
To confirm that Spring Boot CLI is installed correctly, run this command in your terminal:
```bash
spring --version
```
You should see the installed version of Spring Boot CLI (e.g., `Spring CLI v3.3.0`). If this works, you’re ready to start using it!

## Key Ways to Use Spring Boot CLI
Spring Boot CLI provides several features that make it ideal for rapid development and prototyping. Here are the main ways to use it:

### 1. Running Groovy Scripts
One of the standout features of Spring Boot CLI is its ability to run Groovy scripts directly without requiring a full project setup. This is perfect for quick prototyping or experimenting with Spring Boot.

- **Example: Creating a Simple Web Application**
  Create a file named `hello.groovy` with the following content:
  ```groovy
  @RestController
  class HelloController {
      @RequestMapping("/")
      String home() {
          "Hello, World!"
      }
  }
  ```

- **Run the Script**
  In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `hello.groovy` and run:
  ```bash
  spring run hello.groovy
  ```
  This starts a web server on port 8080. Open a browser and visit `http://localhost:8080` to see "Hello, World!" displayed.

- **Adding Dependencies**
  You can include dependencies directly in the script using the `@Grab` annotation. For example:
  ```groovy
  @Grab('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa')
  @RestController
  class HelloController {
      @RequestMapping("/")
      String home() {
          "Hello, World!"
      }
  }
  ```
  This adds Spring Data JPA to your script without needing a build file.

- **Running Multiple Scripts**
  To run all Groovy scripts in the current directory, use:
  ```bash
  spring run *.groovy
  ```

### 2. Creating New Spring Boot Projects
Spring Boot CLI can generate a new project structure with your desired dependencies, saving you time when starting a full application.

- **Example: Generate a Project**
  Run this command to create a new project with web and data-jpa dependencies:
  ```bash
  spring init --dependencies=web,data-jpa my-project
  ```
  This creates a directory called `my-project` containing a Spring Boot application configured with Spring Web and Spring Data JPA.

- **Customization Options**
  You can specify additional options like:
  - Build tool: `--build=maven` or `--build=gradle`
  - Language: `--language=java`, `--language=groovy`, or `--language=kotlin`
  - Packaging: `--packaging=jar` or `--packaging=war`

  For example:
  ```bash
  spring init --dependencies=web --build=gradle --language=kotlin my-kotlin-project
  ```

### 3. Packaging Applications
Spring Boot CLI allows you to package your scripts into executable JAR or WAR files for deployment.

- **Create a JAR File**
  ```bash
  spring jar my-app.jar *.groovy
  ```
  This packages all Groovy scripts in the current directory into `my-app.jar`.

- **Create a WAR File**
  ```bash
  spring war my-app.war *.groovy
  ```
  This generates a `my-app.war` file suitable for deployment to a servlet container.

### 4. Running Tests
If you have Groovy test scripts, you can execute them with:
```bash
spring test *.groovy
```
This runs all test scripts in the current directory.

### 5. Using the Interactive Shell
For an interactive experience, launch the Spring Boot CLI shell:
```bash
spring shell
```
Inside the shell, you can run commands like `run`, `grab`, or `jar` interactively, which is great for experimentation.

---

## Summary
Spring Boot CLI is an excellent tool for developers who want to work with Spring Boot quickly and efficiently from the command line. Here’s how to use it in a nutshell:

1. **Install it** using SDKMAN! (`sdk install springboot`) or manually by downloading the ZIP and updating your PATH.
2. **Run Groovy scripts** with `spring run <script.groovy>` for rapid prototyping.
3. **Create new projects** with `spring init --dependencies=<deps> <project-name>`.
4. **Package applications** into JAR or WAR files using `spring jar` or `spring war`.
5. **Experiment interactively** with `spring shell`.

Whether you’re prototyping an idea, learning Spring Boot, or automating tasks, Spring Boot CLI offers a lightweight and flexible way to get started without the overhead of a full IDE or project setup.
