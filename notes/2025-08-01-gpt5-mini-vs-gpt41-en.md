---

### Overview
GPT-5-mini and GPT-4.1 are models in the OpenAI lineup, with GPT-5-mini being a scaled-down variant of the advanced reasoning-oriented GPT-5, and GPT-4.1 a faster, non-reasoning model optimized for responsiveness. GPT-5-mini excels in complex tasks requiring deep analysis but at the cost of higher latency and potential cost, while GPT-4.1 prioritizes speed and efficiency for simpler interactions. Below is a detailed comparison based on available benchmarks, pricing, and capabilities. **All comparisons are drawn from sources discussing these models.** [1][2][3][4][5]

### Intelligence and Performance
- **Reasoning Depth**: GPT-5-mini employs advanced reasoning modes (e.g., high mode for complex tasks), enabling multi-hop logic, step-by-step analysis, and autonomous task execution. It outperforms GPT-4.1 in benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified (74.9% success rate vs. 54.6%) and Aider’s polyglot code edits (88% passthrough vs. ~52%). In agentic tasks, GPT-5-mini stays on track without losing context, unlike GPT-4.1, which may require more user prompts. **GPT-5's reasoning stability makes it proactive in planning and execution.** [3][4][6]
- **Coding and Math**: GPT-5-mini handles real-world codebases, debugging, and multilingual edits better. It scores higher in mathematical reasoning (e.g., surpassing GPT-4.1 in AIME benchmarks). GPT-4.1 was strong for basic coding but lacks GPT-5-mini's depth in independent solution generation. **GPT-5-mini generates working code patches more reliably.** [3][4]
- **Other Abilities (e.g., Hallucination, Language Tasks)**: GPT-5-mini reduces confusion mid-task and halts less often compared to GPT-4.1. However, both are proficient in general language tasks; GPT-5-mini's strengths shine in analytical, enterprise-level applications. **Hallucination rates are lower in GPT-5-mini for complex prompts.** [3][4]

### Price and Cost Efficiency
- **Input Tokens**: GPT-5-mini is cheaper at $0.25 per 1M tokens, vs. GPT-4.1's $2 per 1M (making GPT-5-mini roughly 8x cheaper for input). GPT-4.1 mini is ~1.6x more expensive than GPT-5-mini. **For cost-effective writing, GPT-5-mini offers better value despite higher token usage in reasoning.** [5][7][8]
- **Output Tokens**: GPT-5-mini costs $2 per 1M, while GPT-4.1 is $8 per 1M (GPT-5-mini ~4x cheaper). GPT-4.1 mini is ~0.8x cheaper than GPT-5-mini for output, but overall, GPT-5-mini is more economical for balanced use. **Token consumption can be 100x higher in GPT-5-mini due to reasoning, offsetting some savings.** [3][5][7][8]
- **Total Cost Trade-offs**: For high-volume, simple tasks, GPT-4.1's speed yields lower per-query costs; GPT-5-mini suits environments where accuracy trumps volume, with Azure pricing linked to usage. **Variants like -nano exist for further cost optimization.** [3][5]

### Speed and Latency
- **Response Time**: GPT-4.1 offers lower latency (~720ms first-token time) for snappy, responsive interactions. GPT-5-mini has higher latency (~1000ms) due to reasoning depth, making it less ideal for real-time apps like voice agents. **In minimal reasoning mode, GPT-5-mini still lags slightly.** [3][4]
- **Throughput and Optimization**: GPT-4.1 excels in high-throughput workloads (e.g., chatbots), delivering fast, concise responses. GPT-5-mini may introduce lags during complex tasks but provides deeper, longer outputs. **GPT-4.1 is optimized for speed; GPT-5-mini prioritizes accuracy over immediacy.** [1][3]

### Context Window and Capabilities
- **Context Window**: GPT-5-mini supports up to 400K input tokens (272K in, 128K out); GPT-4.1 handles 128K short context or up to 1M in long-context mode. **GPT-4.1 allows longer total context for sprawling conversations.** [3][6]
- **Output Length and Perspective**: GPT-5-mini enables structured, analytical outputs; GPT-4.1 focuses on concise, conversational replies. **Variants include turbo modes for custom needs.** [3][1]

### Use Cases and Best Fits
- **Best for GPT-5-Mini**: Complex reasoning, code generation/review, agentic tool-calling, business research, multi-step tasks. Ideal for developers needing advanced coding or math solutions. **Suited for enterprise applications where depth outweighs speed.** [3][4]
- **Best for GPT-4.1**: Real-time chat, customer support, lightweight summarization, short queries, high-volume deployments. Better for low-latency needs like live interactions. **GPT-4.1 variants (e.g., mini) cater to cost-conscious, simple workloads.** [3][4][5]
- **Trade-offs Example**: For cost-effective writing, GPT-5-mini is recommended as "smarter and cheaper," but GPT-4.1 wins in instant feedback scenarios. **Azure offers variants (GPT-5-nano, GPT-4.1-mini) for tailored deployments.** [3][7]
