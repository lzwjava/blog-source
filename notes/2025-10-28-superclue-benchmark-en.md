---

SuperCLUE is a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate Chinese large language models (LLMs). It builds on the original CLUE (Chinese Language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark, expanding it to assess advanced capabilities in LLMs rather than just smaller models. Developed by the CLUEbenchmark team—a collaborative effort involving researchers from institutions like Tsinghua University and companies in the Chinese AI ecosystem—SuperCLUE was first introduced in 2023 to address gaps in evaluating Chinese LLMs against international standards.

### Key Features
- **Focus Areas**: It evaluates models across four main quadrants:
  - Language understanding and generation (e.g., reading comprehension, summarization).
  - Professional skills and knowledge (e.g., math reasoning, coding).
  - Agent intelligence (e.g., tool use, planning).
  - Safety (e.g., bias detection, ethical alignment).
- **Structure**: Broken down into 12 core tasks, with datasets like SuperCLUE-Math6 for multi-step math problems.
- **Purpose**: Helps track progress in Chinese AI, highlighting both strengths (e.g., cultural nuance handling) and gaps compared to global models like GPT series.
- **Updates**: As of mid-2025, it's used for periodic check-ins, with leaderboards showing Chinese models like Qwen and GLM closing the gap on international ones.

The benchmark is open-source and actively maintained, with evaluations often shared via arXiv papers and GitHub.
