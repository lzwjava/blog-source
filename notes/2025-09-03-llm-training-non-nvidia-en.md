title: Training LLMs Without NVIDIA GPUs
translated: false
---

I'm assuming you're referring to training a large language model like Meituan's LongCat or similar models, and you're asking whether it's possible to train such a model without an NVIDIA GPU (based on the context of "longcat" and "n gpu"). If you're referring to something else by "longcat," please clarify, and I’ll tailor the response accordingly.

Training large language models (LLMs) like LongCat, which has 56 billion parameters in its LongCat-Flash version, typically requires significant computational resources, with GPUs (especially NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA support) being the standard due to their parallel processing capabilities. However, it is possible to train such models without an NVIDIA GPU, though it comes with challenges and trade-offs. Below, I’ll outline the feasibility, options, and considerations for training without an NVIDIA GPU, using insights from available information and general knowledge about machine learning.

### **Can You Train LongCat (or Similar LLMs) Without an NVIDIA GPU?**
Yes, it’s possible to train LLMs without an NVIDIA GPU, but it depends on the model size, hardware available, and your goals (e.g., full training vs. fine-tuning). Here’s a breakdown:

#### **1. Challenges of Training Without an NVIDIA GPU**
- **Computational Power**: LLMs like LongCat require massive matrix operations, which GPUs excel at due to their parallel architecture. CPUs or other hardware (e.g., AMD GPUs, TPUs, or integrated graphics) are generally slower and less efficient for these tasks.
- **Memory Constraints**: LongCat-Flash has 56 billion parameters, and even with efficient architectures like Mixture of Experts (MoE), training requires substantial memory. For example, a 7B parameter model needs ~14 GB for inference and ~70 GB for training with a batch size of 1. A 56B model would need significantly more, often exceeding typical CPU RAM or non-NVIDIA GPU memory.[](https://hyperight.com/large-language-models-how-to-run-llms-on-a-single-gpu/)
- **Time**: Training on a CPU or non-NVIDIA hardware can be 10–30x slower than on an NVIDIA GPU, making full training of large models impractical for most users.[](https://datascience2.medium.com/how-to-train-an-lstm-model-30x-faster-using-pytorch-with-gpu-e6bcd3134c86)
- **Software Compatibility**: Many machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) are optimized for NVIDIA’s CUDA, which is exclusive to NVIDIA GPUs. Non-NVIDIA hardware may require additional setup or alternative frameworks, which can be less mature or supported.

#### **2. Alternatives to NVIDIA GPUs for Training**
If you don’t have access to an NVIDIA GPU, here are viable options:

##### **a. CPU-Only Training**
- **Feasibility**: Smaller models (e.g., 1B–7B parameters) or heavily quantized versions can be trained on CPUs, especially with modern high-core-count CPUs (e.g., AMD Ryzen or Intel Xeon). However, a 56B model like LongCat is likely infeasible on a CPU due to memory and time constraints.
- **Techniques to Make It Work**:
  - **Quantization**: Use 4-bit or 8-bit quantization (e.g., with libraries like `bitsandbytes`) to reduce memory usage. For example, a 4-bit quantized 7B model can run on ~12 GB of RAM, making CPU training more feasible for smaller models.[](https://medium.com/%40IbrahimMalick/running-small-llms-locally-my-journey-with-and-without-gpus-1e256cde33bb)[](https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-tuning-llms-on-a-single-consumer-graphic-card-6de1587daddb/)
  - **Gradient Checkpointing**: Reduces memory by recomputing intermediate activations during backpropagation, trading off speed for lower memory usage. This is supported in frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers.[](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perf_train_gpu_one)
  - **Smaller Batch Sizes**: Use a batch size of 1 or accumulate gradients over multiple steps to fit within memory limits, though this can reduce training stability.[](https://medium.com/%40milana.shxanukova15/how-to-train-big-models-when-youre-gpu-poor-4ef008bb2480)
  - **Distilled Models**: Use a smaller, distilled version of the model (if available) to reduce resource needs.[](https://medium.com/%40milana.shxanukova15/how-to-train-big-models-when-youre-gpu-poor-4ef008bb2480)
- **Tools**: Frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow support CPU training. Tools like `llama.cpp` or `Ollama` are optimized for running LLMs on CPUs with quantized models.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1bq9mtb/how_do_i_play_with_llms_if_i_dont_have_a_gpu_at/)[](https://talibilat.medium.com/running-large-language-models-locally-without-a-gpu-2c4cc0791908)
- **Limitations**: CPU training is slow (e.g., 4.5–17.5 tokens/second for 7B–11B models) and impractical for large models like LongCat without significant optimization.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1bq9mtb/how_do_i_play_with_llms_if_i_dont_have_a_gpu_at/)

##### **b. AMD GPUs**
- **Feasibility**: AMD GPUs (e.g., Radeon RX series) can be used for training with frameworks like PyTorch ROCm (AMD’s equivalent to CUDA). However, ROCm is less mature, supports fewer models, and is limited to specific AMD GPUs and Linux environments.
- **Setup**: Install PyTorch with ROCm support on a compatible AMD GPU (e.g., RX 6900 XT). You may need to check model compatibility, as not all LLMs (including LongCat) are guaranteed to work seamlessly.
- **Performance**: AMD GPUs can approach NVIDIA GPU performance for certain tasks but may require more configuration and have less community support for LLMs.[](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/41956/how-to-make-my-neural-netwok-run-on-gpu-instead-of-cpu)
- **Limitations**: Limited VRAM (e.g., 16 GB on high-end consumer AMD GPUs) makes training large models like LongCat challenging without multi-GPU setups or quantization.

##### **c. Google TPUs**
- **Feasibility**: Google’s TPUs (available via Google Cloud or Colab) are an alternative to NVIDIA GPUs. TPUs are optimized for matrix operations and can handle large-scale training.
- **Setup**: Use TensorFlow or JAX with TPU support. Google Colab Pro offers TPU access for a fee, which can be cost-effective compared to renting NVIDIA GPUs.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1e7xqqx/how_to_train_a_small_model_with_no_local_gpu/)[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64137099/neural-networks-ml-without-gpu-what-are-my-options)
- **Cost**: TPUs are often cheaper than high-end NVIDIA GPUs on cloud platforms. For example, Google Cloud TPU pricing can be lower than AWS EC2 instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs.
- **Limitations**: TPU training requires rewriting code for TensorFlow or JAX, which may not support LongCat’s MoE architecture out of the box. Porting models to TPUs can be complex.[](https://medium.com/%40milana.shxanukova15/how-to-train-big-models-when-youre-gpu-poor-4ef008bb2480)

##### **d. Cloud Services Without NVIDIA GPUs**
- **Options**: Platforms like Google Colab (with TPUs or CPUs), Kaggle (free CPU/TPU resources), or RunPod (offers non-NVIDIA options) can be used for training without local NVIDIA GPUs.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1e7xqqx/how_to_train_a_small_model_with_no_local_gpu/)[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64137099/neural-networks-ml-without-gpu-what-are-my-options)
- **Cost-Effective Solutions**: Google Colab’s free tier offers limited TPU/CPU access, while Colab Pro provides more resources. RunPod offers affordable non-NVIDIA GPU rentals (e.g., $0.43/hour for a VM with 14 vCPUs, 30 GB RAM, and an RTX 3090, though this is still NVIDIA-based).[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1e7xqqx/how_to_train_a_small_model_with_no_local_gpu/)
- **Use Case**: Fine-tuning smaller models or running inference is more feasible than full training of a 56B model on these platforms.

##### **e. Other Hardware (e.g., Apple M1/M2, Intel GPUs)**
- **Apple Silicon**: Macs with M1/M2 chips can run LLMs using frameworks like `llama.cpp` or `Ollama` for inference and fine-tuning. However, training a 56B model is impractical due to limited memory (up to 128 GB on high-end Macs) and slower performance compared to GPUs.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1bq9mtb/how_do_i_play_with_llms_if_i_dont_have_a_gpu_at/)
- **Intel Arc GPUs**: Intel’s GPUs support OpenVINO for optimized inference and some training tasks, but they are not yet widely used for LLMs and have limited VRAM.[](https://medium.com/%40milana.shxanukova15/how-to-train-big-models-when-youre-gpu-poor-4ef008bb2480)
- **Limitations**: These options are better suited for inference or fine-tuning small models, not full training of large models like LongCat.

#### **3. Specific Considerations for LongCat**
- **Model Architecture**: LongCat-Flash uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, activating 18.6–31.3 billion parameters per token, which reduces computational load compared to dense models. However, even with MoE, the memory and compute requirements are substantial, making CPU-only training impractical for full training.[](https://www.aibase.com/fr/news/16536)
- **Fine-Tuning vs. Full Training**: Full training of LongCat from scratch would require massive resources (e.g., Meituan invested billions in GPU infrastructure). Fine-tuning, especially with techniques like LoRA or QLoRA, is more feasible on limited hardware. For example, QLoRA can fine-tune a 7B model on a single 24 GB GPU, but scaling to 56B would still be challenging without multi-GPU setups or cloud resources.[](https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-tuning-llms-on-a-single-consumer-graphic-card-6de1587daddb/)
- **Open-Source Availability**: LongCat-Flash is open-sourced, so you can access its weights and try fine-tuning. However, the lack of NVIDIA GPUs may require significant optimization (e.g., quantization, gradient checkpointing) to fit it on alternative hardware.[](https://www.aibase.com/fr/news/16536)

#### **4. Practical Steps for Training Without NVIDIA GPUs**
If you want to attempt training or fine-tuning LongCat (or a similar model) without an NVIDIA GPU, follow these steps:
1. **Choose a Smaller Model or Fine-Tune**: Start with a smaller model (e.g., 1B–7B parameters) or focus on fine-tuning LongCat using LoRA/QLoRA to reduce resource needs.[](https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-tuning-llms-on-a-single-consumer-graphic-card-6de1587daddb/)
2. **Optimize for CPU or Alternative Hardware**:
   - Use `llama.cpp` or `Ollama` for CPU-optimized inference and fine-tuning.[](https://talibilat.medium.com/running-large-language-models-locally-without-a-gpu-2c4cc0791908)
   - Apply 4-bit quantization with `bitsandbytes` or `Hugging Face Transformers`.[](https://medium.com/%40IbrahimMalick/running-small-llms-locally-my-journey-with-and-without-gpus-1e256cde33bb)
   - Enable gradient checkpointing and use small batch sizes (e.g., 1–4).[](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perf_train_gpu_one)
3. **Leverage Cloud Resources**: Use Google Colab (TPU/CPU), Kaggle, or RunPod for affordable access to non-NVIDIA hardware.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1e7xqqx/how_to_train_a_small_model_with_no_local_gpu/)
4. **Check Framework Compatibility**: Ensure your framework (e.g., PyTorch ROCm for AMD, TensorFlow/JAX for TPUs) supports LongCat’s architecture. MoE models may require specific handling.
5. **Test Locally First**: Prototype with a small dataset and batch size on a CPU to verify your code before scaling to cloud or alternative hardware.[](https://medium.com/%40milana.shxanukova15/how-to-train-big-models-when-youre-gpu-poor-4ef008bb2480)
6. **Monitor Performance**: CPU training will be slow, so prioritize fine-tuning over full training and use tools like `Unsloth` for faster fine-tuning with lower memory use.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1e7xqqx/how_to_train_a_small_model_with_no_local_gpu/)

#### **5. Recommendations**
- **For Hobbyists or Budget-Constrained Users**: Focus on fine-tuning a smaller model (e.g., 7B parameters) using a CPU or cloud-based TPU. Google Colab’s free tier or Kaggle’s 30 hours/week of free resources are good starting points.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1e7xqqx/how_to_train_a_small_model_with_no_local_gpu/)
- **For LongCat Specifically**: Given its 56B parameters, full training without NVIDIA GPUs is likely infeasible on consumer hardware. Fine-tuning with QLoRA on a high-memory CPU (e.g., 64 GB RAM) or a cloud TPU is your best bet.
- **If You Need GPUs**: Renting NVIDIA GPUs via RunPod, AWS, or Google Cloud is often more practical than buying hardware. If you prefer non-NVIDIA, AMD GPUs with ROCm or TPUs are viable but require more setup.

#### **6. Conclusion**
Training a model like LongCat without an NVIDIA GPU is technically possible but highly challenging due to its scale. For practical purposes, focus on fine-tuning with techniques like QLoRA, gradient checkpointing, and quantization, using a CPU, AMD GPU, or TPU. Cloud platforms like Google Colab or RunPod can provide affordable access to non-NVIDIA hardware. If you’re working offline or on a budget, start with smaller models and optimize heavily for CPU use.

If you have specific hardware (e.g., CPU specs, AMD GPU model) or goals (e.g., fine-tuning for a specific task), let me know, and I can provide a more tailored guide. Also, if “longcat” refers to something else (e.g., a meme or another context), please clarify!
