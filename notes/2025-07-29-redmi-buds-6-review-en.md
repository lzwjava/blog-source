translated: false
---

The **Redmi Buds 6** are budget-friendly wireless earbuds that offer a compelling mix of features, including active noise cancellation (ANC), solid sound quality, and long battery life for their price point (around $28–$40 depending on the region). Below is a detailed breakdown of their performance, focusing on noise cancellation and overall quality, based on available reviews and information.

### **Overall Performance of Redmi Buds 6**
- **Sound Quality**: The Redmi Buds 6 feature a dual-driver setup with a 12.4mm titanium-plated diaphragm and a 5.5mm piezoelectric ceramic unit, delivering balanced audio with strong bass, clear mids, and detailed highs. They perform well for genres like pop, EDM, and hip-hop, with customizable EQ settings (Standard, Enhanced Bass, Enhanced Voice, Enhanced Treble) via the Xiaomi Earbuds app. The 360° spatial audio adds immersion for movies and games, though it’s not as refined as premium models. Some reviews note that sound quality can degrade slightly when ANC is enabled, particularly in bass depth.[](https://www.gsmarena.com/redmi_buds_6_review-news-65741.php)[](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/redmi-buds-6-review-pros-and-cons/)[](https://www.dokkantech.com/products/xiaomi-redmi-buds-6-exceptional-sound-advanced-features)
- **Design and Comfort**: The earbuds have a lightweight, ergonomic design with a glossy finish and silicone ear tips for a secure fit. The compact charging case is pocket-friendly and features a Flow LED battery indicator. They’re comfortable for extended use, though the glossy case may attract smudges.[](https://www.gadgetbridge.com/gadget-reviews/redmi-buds-6-review-balanced-soundstage-served-with-impressive-anc/)[](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/redmi-buds-6-review-pros-and-cons/)
- **Battery Life**: The earbuds offer up to 10 hours of playback without ANC and about 6.5–7 hours with ANC enabled. The charging case extends total playback to 42 hours (without ANC) or around 26 hours (with ANC). A 10-minute fast charge provides up to 4 hours of playback, making them reliable for daily use.[](https://www.gadgetbridge.com/gadget-reviews/redmi-buds-6-review-balanced-soundstage-served-with-impressive-anc/)[](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/redmi-buds-6-review-pros-and-cons/)
- **Features**: The Buds 6 support Bluetooth 5.4 for stable connections up to 10 meters, dual-device connectivity, and Google Fast Pair for Android. The Xiaomi Earbuds app allows customization of touch controls, ANC modes, and EQ settings. Additional features include in-ear detection, audio sharing, and a “Find My Earphones” function. However, some features (e.g., low-latency gaming mode) are exclusive to Xiaomi devices.[](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/redmi-buds-6-review-pros-and-cons/)[](https://www.dokkantech.com/products/xiaomi-redmi-buds-6-exceptional-sound-advanced-features)
- **Call Quality**: Dual-mic AI noise reduction and wind noise cancellation (up to 9m/s) ensure clear calls in most environments, though some background noise may still seep through in very noisy settings.[](https://www.gadgetbridge.com/gadget-reviews/redmi-buds-6-review-balanced-soundstage-served-with-impressive-anc/)[](https://www.dokkantech.com/products/xiaomi-redmi-buds-6-exceptional-sound-advanced-features)

### **Noise Cancellation Performance**
The Redmi Buds 6 offer **active noise cancellation (ANC)** with a maximum noise reduction of **49dB**, which is impressive for their price range. They feature three ANC modes—**Light**, **Balanced**, and **Deep**—along with three transparency modes (Regular, Enhance Voice, Enhance Ambient Sound). Here’s a detailed look at their ANC performance:

- **Effectiveness**:
  - **Low-Frequency Noise**: The ANC excels at reducing consistent low-frequency sounds, such as ceiling fans, air conditioners, computer hums, or traffic noise. In indoor settings, it significantly dampens background noise like keyboard clicks or office chatter. Outdoors, Deep mode effectively muffles car engines and tire noise by about 50–70%.[](https://www.vopmart.com/blog/post/redmi-buds-6-review)[](https://www.gadgetbridge.com/gadget-reviews/redmi-buds-6-review-balanced-soundstage-served-with-impressive-anc/)[](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/redmi-buds-6-review-pros-and-cons/)
  - **High-Frequency Noise**: The ANC is less effective against high-pitched or sudden sounds, such as human voices, car horns, or mechanical clicks. For example, shrill horns or keyboard clacking may still be audible, though reduced in intensity. This is typical for budget earbuds, as high-frequency noise cancellation is more challenging.[](https://www.vopmart.com/blog/post/redmi-buds-6-review)[](https://www.gsmarena.com/redmi_buds_6_review-news-65741.php)
  - **Wind Noise**: The earbuds incorporate AI-based wind noise reduction (up to 9m/s), which performs well for calls and general use in windy conditions, though some wind noise may still be noticeable.[](https://www.dokkantech.com/products/xiaomi-redmi-buds-6-exceptional-sound-advanced-features)
  - **Adaptive ANC**: The earbuds automatically adjust noise cancellation based on ear canal structure and fit, offering a personalized experience. This feature also supports single-ear use, which is rare at this price.[](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/redmi-buds-6-review-pros-and-cons/)[](https://www.dokkantech.com/products/xiaomi-redmi-buds-6-exceptional-sound-advanced-features)

- **Modes**:
  - **Light Mode**: Ideal for quieter environments like cafes or parks, reducing minimal background noise while keeping you aware of surroundings.
  - **Balanced Mode**: Suitable for moderate noise levels, such as offices or parks, striking a balance between noise reduction and environmental awareness.
  - **Deep Mode**: Best for noisy environments like public transport or busy streets, providing maximum noise reduction (up to 49dB).[](https://www.vopmart.com/blog/post/redmi-buds-6-review)[](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/redmi-buds-6-review-pros-and-cons/)
  - **Transparency Modes**: The transparency modes allow you to hear surroundings without removing the earbuds. The Enhance Ambient Sound mode is the most natural, while the Enhance Voice mode struggles to isolate voices clearly and may sound muffled.[](https://www.gsmarena.com/redmi_buds_6_review-news-65741.php)[](https://www.gadgetbridge.com/gadget-reviews/redmi-buds-6-review-balanced-soundstage-served-with-impressive-anc/)

- **Limitations**:
  - Some users report that ANC can introduce a slight high-frequency hiss, which may be noticeable in quiet settings.[](https://www.gsmarena.com/redmi_buds_6_review-news-65741.php)
  - When ANC is enabled, sound quality may lose some bass depth or clarity, forcing users to choose between noise cancellation and optimal audio.[](https://www.gsmarena.com/redmi_buds_6_review-news-65741.php)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/1fg3boc/whats_up_with_redmi_buds_6_liteactiveplay_good/)
  - The ANC is not as robust as premium earbuds like the AirPods Pro 2 or Google Pixel Buds Pro 2, particularly for mid- and high-frequency noises.[](https://www.gsmarena.com/redmi_buds_6_review-news-65741.php)
  - Some Reddit users have reported issues with ANC on the Redmi Buds 6 Lite, such as inconsistent performance or bass loss when ANC is active, though these may not apply directly to the standard Buds 6. Firmware updates could address such issues.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/1fkj4l4/redmi_buds_6_lite_initial_thoughts/)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/1fg3boc/whats_up_with_redmi_buds_6_liteactiveplay_good/)

- **Comparison to Competitors**:
  - Compared to similarly priced earbuds like the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro, the Redmi Buds 6 perform similarly in mid-frequency noise reduction but let through more high-frequency sounds.[](https://www.gsmarena.com/redmi_buds_6_review-news-65741.php)
  - The ANC is a step up from the Redmi Buds 5 (46dB) and significantly better than the Buds 6 Lite, which has weaker ANC.[](https://www.scarbir.com/tws/redmi-buds-6-review)[](https://www.nextpit.com/xiaomi-redmi-buds-6-price-us-europe-specs-launch)
  - For their price, the ANC is considered “solid” and “effective” for everyday scenarios like commuting or working in noisy environments, though it doesn’t match the performance of high-end models costing $200–$300.[](https://www.scarbir.com/tws/redmi-buds-6-review)[](https://www.nextpit.com/reviews/redmi-buds-6-pro-review)

### **Is the Noise Cancellation Good?**
Yes, the noise cancellation on the Redmi Buds 6 is **good for the price**, offering effective reduction of low-frequency ambient noise (e.g., traffic, fans) and decent performance in noisy environments like public transport or offices. The 49dB ANC is a standout feature in the sub-$40 segment, and the ability to customize modes and use adaptive ANC adds versatility. However, it struggles with high-frequency sounds and may slightly compromise sound quality when active. For budget-conscious buyers seeking reliable ANC for daily use, the Redmi Buds 6 deliver excellent value, but those needing top-tier noise cancellation for very noisy environments might want to consider pricier options like the Redmi Buds 6 Pro (55dB ANC) or competitors like the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro.[](https://www.gsmarena.com/redmi_buds_6_review-news-65741.php)[](https://www.scarbir.com/tws/redmi-buds-6-review)[](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/redmi-buds-6-review-pros-and-cons/)

### **Verdict**
The Redmi Buds 6 are a strong contender in the budget TWS market, offering robust ANC, good sound quality, and long battery life for an affordable price. The noise cancellation is effective for low-frequency noises and suitable for most daily scenarios, though it’s not flawless for high-pitched sounds or in extremely noisy settings. If you’re looking for cost-effective earbuds with solid ANC and versatile features, the Redmi Buds 6 are a great choice, especially if you use a Xiaomi device to unlock their full potential.
