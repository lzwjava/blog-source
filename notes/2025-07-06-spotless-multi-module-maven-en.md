### Spotless in Multi-Module Maven Projects

Spotless is a code formatting plugin available for both Maven and Gradle. Based on your mention of Maven's `-pl` (project list) flag, I'll assume you're using the **Spotless Maven plugin** in a multi-module Java project. This allows you to run formatting checks (e.g., via `spotless:check`) or apply fixes (e.g., via `spotless:apply`) selectively on specific modules, which is efficient for large projects where you might only need to format certain modules (e.g., during development on a specific submodule).

#### Prerequisites
- Your project uses Maven with a multi-module structure (defined in a parent `pom.xml` with `<modules>...</modules>`).
- Spotless Maven plugin is configured in your project (typically in the parent POM or individual module POMs). If not, add it to your POM:
  ```xml
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.diffplug.spotless</groupId>
        <artifactId>spotless-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.43.0</version>  <!-- Use the latest version -->
        <configuration>
          <!-- Your formatting rules here, e.g., for Java, Groovy -->
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ```
  - Common rules include Google Java Format, Eclipse JDT for Java, or customizations for imports, spacing, etc.
  - Spotless supports many file types (Java, Kotlin, XML, etc.) and integrates well with CI tools for pre-commit hooks (via the `spotless:check` goal, which fails builds on unformatted code).

#### Using `-pl` to Control Module Formatting
Maven's `-pl` (project list) flag lets you specify a comma-separated list of modules to include in the build/plugin execution. By default, Maven runs on all modules, but `-pl` restricts it, saving time and avoiding unnecessary work on unaffected modules.

- **Basic Command Structure**:
  - To check formatting (without applying changes): `mvn spotless:check -pl module1,module2`
  - To apply formatting fixes: `mvn spotless:apply -pl module1,module2`
  - Replace `module1,module2` with the actual module names (e.g., relative paths from the root, like `core,api`).

- **Examples**:
  1. **Check formatting only on the `core` module**:
     ```
     mvn spotless:check -pl core
     ```
     - This scans and validates only `core`'s source files. If any formatting issues exist, the build fails with details (e.g., "Please run `spotless:apply` to fix").

  2. **Apply formatting to multiple modules (`api` and `utils`)**:
     ```
     mvn spotless:apply -pl api,utils
     ```
     - This modifies files in-place to match your Spotless rules. Always commit changes after to avoid surprises in version control.

  3. **Exclude specific modules during a full project run**: Use `-pl !moduleToSkip` to run on everything *except* certain modules (Maven 3.2.1+ supports negation with `!`).
     - Example: `mvn spotless:check -pl !legacy` (runs on all modules except `legacy`).

- **Tips for Efficiency**:
  - **Parallel Execution**: Add `-T 4` for multi-threaded builds (e.g., `mvn spotless:check -pl core,api -T 4`).
  - **Dry Run**: Use `spotless:check` first to preview issues without changes—it's idempotent and safe.
  - **Integration with IDE/Version Control**: Configure Spotless to run on save/commit in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ via Spotless plugin) or use it as a pre-commit hook (via tools like pre-commit or Git hooks) for automated checks.
  - **Handling Reactor Resolution**: If module dependencies are complex, Maven resolves them automatically when using `-pl`, ensuring dependent modules are processed first if needed.
  - **Common Issues**:
    - If `-pl` isn't working, ensure modules are defined in `<modules>` and use fully qualified paths if there are ambiguities (e.g., `-pl :core` for multi-repo setups).
    - For Gradle users (if you meant Spotless Gradle plugin instead), the equivalent is `-p` for project paths, but your query specifies `-pl`, so Maven is assumed. If it's Gradle, switch to plugins like `gradle task -p submodule`.
