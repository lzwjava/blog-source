Here’s a clean, reader‑friendly introduction to the **markdownlint** project by David Anson:

## What is **markdownlint**?

**markdownlint** is a static analysis tool for Markdown/CommonMark files, built on Node.js. Its core purpose is to enforce consistency and style rules across Markdown content—helping writers maintain a clean, uniform format and avoid constructs that could break or render inconsistently across different parsers ([GitHub][1]).

Inspired by the Ruby-based markdownlint (markdownlint/mdl), this tool embraces a rich library of linting rules. It leverages the micromark parser for CommonMark support and extends it with GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features like tables, autolinks, directives, footnotes, and math ([GitHub][1]).

## Key Features & Integrations

* **Rule Coverage**: Offers a comprehensive set of built-in rules—ranging from heading styles and list indentation to trailing spaces and line length (e.g., MD001, MD009, MD013…) ([GitHub][1]).
* **Ecosystem Compatibility**:

  * **Command Line Tools**:

    * `markdownlint-cli` – a traditional CLI interface.
    * `markdownlint-cli2` – a faster, configuration-based CLI with flexible formatting options and support for globs, output formats, autofixing, and integration with CI workflows ([GitHub][2], [GitHub][3]).
  * **VS Code Extension**:

    * `vscode‑markdownlint` brings real-time linting to your editor. Violations are flagged inline (underlined), with hover-capable tooltips and quick-fix suggestions ([GitHub][4]).
  * **GitHub Action**:

    * `markdownlint‑cli2‑action` lets you embed markdownlint into your CI pipeline, enabling automatic checks (and optional autofixes) during GitHub workflows ([GitHub][5]).

## Why Use It?

* **Consistency**: Ensures Markdown files adhere to a defined style guide, reducing formatting drift across a project.
* **Editor Assistance**: Inline feedback in VS Code and other integrations make writing cleaner and faster.
* **Automation**: Use in CI pipelines with lint tools or GitHub Actions to enforce standards before merges.
* **Customizable**: You can customize rule sets or even disable rules via config files or inline comments (e.g., disabling MD013 for long lines) ([GitHub][5], [Software Recommendations Stack Exchange][6]).
