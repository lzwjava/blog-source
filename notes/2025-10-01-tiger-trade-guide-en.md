### How to Show Buy/Sell in Tiger Trade Global Mobile App

The Tiger Trade app (published by Tiger Brokers, also known as Tiger Trade: Invest Globally on Google Play or similar in regional app stores) allows trading of US stocks, options, ETFs, futures, and more. The latest version as of September 2025 is 9.4.0.2, which introduced enhancements to TigerAI for analysis and shareholder functions showing buying/selling trends [1].

To display buy/sell options in the app (assuming you're referring to stock or options trading pages):

1. **Open the App and Navigate to a Stock**:
   - Search for a stock (e.g., AAPL) on the home or markets tab.
   - Tap the stock to open its detail page, which includes chart, news, and analysis tabs.

2. **Show Buy/Sell Buttons for Stocks**:
   - On the stock page, scroll to the bottom or tap the "Trade" icon.
   - Buy and Sell buttons appear, allowing you to enter order details (e.g., quantity, order type like market or limit).
   - No persistent buy/sell overlays exist on the chart in the mobile app (unlike the desktop version, which has configurable chart trading settings with buttons [2] [2]).

3. **Show Buy/Sell for Options**:
   - On the stock page, tap the "Options" tab to view the options chain.
   - Scroll to select expiration dates. Each option shows bid/ask prices with implied buy/sell actions when tapped (buy to open for calls/puts, or sell if long a position [3] [4]).
   - If no options display buy/sell (e.g., the list appears empty after clicking something), you may have switched to "My Positions" filter, which only shows options you hold. Switch back to "All Options" at the top of the chain [4].

### Regarding "Weekly Invest" Feature
There is no feature explicitly named "Weekly Invest" or "AI Weekly Invest," but this likely refers to **Auto-Invest** (also called Tiger Invest), a regular investing tool for US stocks and ETFs:
- It supports automated buys (not sells) at fixed intervals, such as weekly, starting from $2 USD (or equivalent in HKD/other currencies) using fractional shares [5] [5].
- Access: Go to Portfolio > Auto-Invest (or search in app menus).
- Does not affect buy/sell visibility on stock/pages—trading remains separate. If buy/sell buttons disappeared after interacting with Auto-Invest, restart the app or log out/in, as it may be a UI glitch in 9.4.0.2.

If the buttons are still hidden post-adventure (e.g., after clicking a filter, chart toggle, or AI feature), check:
- Ensure your account is funded and eligible for trading (Tiger supports fractional shares and options for eligible users [6]).
- Disable TigerAI overlays or switch chart timeframes if interfering visually.
- For app settings: Tap Profile > Settings > check for display options (no specific buy/sell toggle in mobile).

For further help, visit the Tiger Trade help center or contact support. If this is for desktop Tiger Trade Windows/Mac, chart trading buttons can be enabled via Options > Chart Settings > Trading [2].
