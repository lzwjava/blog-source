### Overview of Wi-Fi 7
Wi-Fi 7, officially known as IEEE 802.11be (Extreme High Throughput or EHT), is the latest wireless standard succeeding Wi-Fi 6 and 6E. Certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance in early 2024, it focuses on dramatically higher speeds, reduced latency, and better efficiency in crowded networks. It operates across the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands (building on Wi-Fi 6E's addition of 6 GHz) and is backward compatible with older devices, though full benefits require Wi-Fi 7 hardware on both ends. Theoretical peak speeds reach up to 46 Gbps—about 4.8x faster than Wi-Fi 6—making it ideal for 8K streaming, AR/VR, cloud gaming, and dense IoT environments.

### Key New Features
- **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)**: A flagship innovation allowing devices to connect across multiple frequency bands (e.g., 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz) simultaneously for a single session. This aggregates bandwidth for higher throughput, cuts latency by up to 4x compared to Wi-Fi 6, and improves reliability by dynamically avoiding interference or congestion. Unlike single-band operation in prior standards, MLO enables seamless handoffs in mesh networks and boosts stability for real-time apps.
  
- **Wider Channel Bandwidth (320 MHz)**: Doubles the 160 MHz max from Wi-Fi 6/6E, primarily in the 6 GHz band, allowing more data to flow at once—like adding extra lanes to a highway. This supports up to 5x greater network capacity and is key to the overall speed boost.

- **4096-QAM Modulation (4K-QAM)**: Encodes 12 bits per symbol (vs. 10 bits in Wi-Fi 6's 1024-QAM or 8 bits in Wi-Fi 5's 256-QAM), squeezing 20% more data into each transmission. It requires cleaner signals, so it's most effective in low-interference setups, enhancing efficiency for high-bandwidth tasks.

- **Enhanced OFDMA and Multi-RU Puncturing**: Builds on Wi-Fi 6's OFDMA by introducing Multi-Resource Unit (Multi-RU) allocation, letting a single device use multiple resource units for finer traffic management. Puncturing "punches holes" in interfered sub-channels to salvage usable spectrum, reducing waste in busy areas—unavailable in earlier Wi-Fi versions.

- **16 Spatial Streams and Improved MU-MIMO**: Doubles streams from 8 in Wi-Fi 6 to 16, paired with upgraded Multi-User MIMO for serving more devices at once without bottlenecks. This increases overall throughput in multi-device homes or offices.

- **Lower Latency and Efficiency Tweaks**: Features like shorter guard intervals (0.8 μs vs. 3.2 μs in Wi-Fi 6) and enhanced Target Wake Time (TWT) extend battery life on devices by up to 20-30% while minimizing delays. It also includes better forward-compatible frame formats and implicit channel sounding for faster beamforming.

### Benefits and Impact
These upgrades make Wi-Fi 7 more resilient in high-density scenarios (e.g., stadiums or smart cities) and future-proof for emerging tech. Real-world speeds will vary (expect 5-10 Gbps in ideal conditions), but early adopters report smoother 4K/8K video, lag-free gaming, and better handling of 100+ connected devices. As of late 2025, Wi-Fi 7 routers and devices from brands like TP-Link, Netgear, and Intel are widely available, with full ecosystem rollout accelerating.
