Good question — yes, there is evidence that SerpApi (serpapi.com) is **more popular / more established** than Serper (serper.dev), though “popularity” can mean different things. Here’s a breakdown of what the data shows, and some caveats.

---

### ✔ Evidence that SerpApi is more popular

* Traffic: SerpApi’s site was reported to have about **764,810** visits in August 2025 globally (with a global rank ~60,000) according to SEMrush. ([Semrush][1])
* Market presence / age: SerpApi claims it has been in business since 2017 and supports “80+ APIs” (search engines) compared to Serper which supports far fewer. ([SerpApi][2])
* Reviews: SerpApi has numerous reviews on platforms like Capterra; users mention long-term usage (“we’ve relied on SerpAPI for 7 years …”) in at least one review. ([Capterra][3])
* Integration in community: On forums (e.g., Reddit) there are multiple posts about SerpApi being used in workflows and templates. ([reddit.com][4])

---

### ✘ Evidence that Serper is less popular (or at least younger/smaller)

* Site traffic: Serper’s domain was estimated to receive about 5,100 visitors/day (~154,800/month) and ranked ~201,270 globally per Hypestat. ([HypeStat][5])
* Fewer references: There are fewer third-party reviews, benchmarks, or long-term testimonials for Serper compared to SerpApi.
* Relative ranking in comparisons: A competitive “score” comparison gave SerpApi a higher score (57/100) vs Serper (53/100) in one report. ([幂简集成][6])

### 🧐 So in summary

Yes — if you define “more popular” as “more traffic / more established user base / more vendor integrations and references”, then SerpApi appears ahead of Serper.
However — popularity doesn’t necessarily mean “better for your use-case”. Popular services may cost more, have different limitations, or may be over-engineered for what you need.

---

### ⚠️ A few caveats

* Traffic and “popular usage” don’t guarantee suitability for **your region** (Taiwan / China / Guangzhou). Latency, geolocation support, local compliance might differ.
* Popularity can correlate with higher cost; some sources say SerpApi is *more expensive* per request than some alternatives. ([Medium][7])
* The measurement of “popularity” is approximate: Website traffic is a proxy; actual API user count may differ, especially for niche services or internal use.

If you like, I can try to pull up **Google Trends data**, GitHub stars or developer community mentions for both services (SerpApi vs Serper) to give a more nuanced “popularity” comparison. Would you like me to do that?
