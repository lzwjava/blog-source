To connect audio speakers to your computer using the motherboard's RCA (or "RS out") output, follow these steps. Note that the MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi motherboard typically doesn't have RCA outputs directly, as most modern motherboards use 3.5mm audio jacks or HDMI for audio output. However, I’ll assume you’re referring to the motherboard’s audio output (likely a 3.5mm jack labeled for rear speakers or line-out) or an RCA adapter/converter.

### Steps to Connect Audio Speakers with RCA Output:

1. **Identify the Audio Output on the Motherboard**:
   - Check the rear I/O panel of your MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi motherboard. It typically has multiple 3.5mm audio jacks, including a green one (line-out) for stereo speakers or a center/subwoofer output (orange) for surround sound setups.
   - If your speakers have RCA inputs (red and white connectors), you’ll likely need an adapter or converter.

2. **Check Speaker Requirements**:
   - Confirm whether your speakers are **powered** (active, with a built-in amplifier) or **passive** (requiring an external amplifier).
     - **Powered speakers**: Can connect directly to the motherboard’s audio output with the right cable or adapter.
     - **Passive speakers**: Require an external amplifier or receiver with RCA inputs.

3. **Get the Right Cable/Adapter**:
   - If your speakers have RCA inputs, you’ll need a **3.5mm to RCA cable** or adapter:

Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor: I already have the extra ones in my house.A male cable**: Connects the motherboard’s green 3.5mm line-out jack (or another designated audio output) to the RCA inputs on your speakers or amplifier.
     - **3.5mm to RCA adapter**: If you already have an RCA cable, you can use a 3.5mm female to RCA male adapter.
   - Example product: A 3.5mm to RCA cable (similar to the Cable Matters SATA cable you listed, but for audio). These are widely available for 10-50 CNY on JD.com.

4. **Connect the Speakers**:
   - **For Powered Speakers**:
     - Plug the 3.5mm end of the cable into the green line-out jack on the motherboard’s rear I/O panel.
     - Connect the RCA ends (red and white) to the corresponding RCA inputs on your speakers.
     - Power on the speakers and ensure their volume is turned up.
   - **For Passive Speakers**:
     - Connect the 3.5mm end to the motherboard’s line-out jack.
     - Plug the RCA ends into the RCA inputs of an external amplifier or receiver.
     - Connect the passive speakers to the amplifier’s speaker terminals (usually via speaker wire, not RCA).
     - Power on the amplifier and adjust its settings.

5. **Configure Audio Settings**:
   - Boot up your computer and ensure the speakers are powered on.
   - In Windows:
     - Right-click the speaker icon in the system tray and select **Sounds** or **Sound settings**.
     - In the **Playback** tab, select the output device (e.g., "Speakers" or "Realtek Audio") and set it as the default.
     - If using surround sound, go to **Properties > Advanced** and configure the speaker setup (e.g., stereo or 5.1 surround).
   - Install the latest **Realtek Audio Drivers** for your MSI motherboard from MSI’s official website or JD.com if not already installed, to ensure optimal audio performance.

6. **Test the Audio**:
   - Play audio (e.g., music or a video) to verify sound output.
   - Adjust volume levels on the speakers, amplifier (if used), and in Windows.
   - If there’s no sound, check:
     - Cable connections are secure.
     - The correct playback device is selected in Windows.
     - The motherboard’s audio output is enabled in BIOS (rarely disabled, but check MSI’s BIOS settings under **Advanced > Integrated Peripherals** if needed).

### Notes:
- **Motherboard Audio**: The MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi uses a Realtek audio chipset, which supports high-quality audio output via 3.5mm jacks. RCA outputs are not standard, so you’re likely using an adapter or referring to the line-out jack.
- **Alternative Outputs**:
  - If your speakers support HDMI or optical (S/PDIF), your motherboard also has an S/PDIF optical output or HDMI (via the GPU for video+audio). Check if your speakers or amplifier support these for potentially better audio quality.
  - The RTX 4070 GPU’s HDMI/DisplayPort outputs can carry audio to a monitor or receiver with speakers, if preferred.
- **Cost**: A 3.5mm to RCA cable or adapter is inexpensive (10-50 CNY on JD.com). Ensure it supports audio (not just data, like your SATA cable).
- **Surround Sound**: If your speakers are part of a 5.1 or 7.1 setup, use the additional 3.5mm jacks (e.g., orange for center/subwoofer, black for rear) and configure them in Windows.

If you clarify the speaker model or whether you’re using an amplifier, I can provide more specific guidance. If you meant a different "RS out" (e.g., a specific port or device), please provide details, and I’ll adjust the instructions.
