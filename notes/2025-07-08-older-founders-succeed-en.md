title: Older Founders Excel in Tech Startups
translated: false

Yes, absolutely! The idea that successful tech and app startups are solely the domain of young, college-dropout founders is largely a myth. In fact, research suggests that **older founders (in their 40s, 50s, and even beyond) actually have a higher probability of success, including lasting long, exiting well, and achieving good profit and revenue.**

Here are some examples and reasons why this is often the case:

**Successful Examples of Older Founders in Tech/App Space:**

* **Eric Yuan (Zoom):** Founded Zoom at **41 years old**. Zoom became a household name and a massively successful public company, especially during the pandemic.
* **Reed Hastings (Netflix):** Co-founded Netflix at **37 years old**. While not in his 40s or 50s at the very beginning, he's a prime example of someone who founded a hugely impactful tech company after the typical "young founder" age.
* **Bill Porter (E-Trade):** Founded E-Trade at **54 years old**. This was a significant online brokerage that transformed how people invested.
* **Arianna Huffington (The Huffington Post):** Launched The Huffington Post at **54 years old** in 2005. It grew into a major news and opinion website, later acquired by AOL.
* **Joanna Strober (Midi Health):** Founded Midi Health, a virtual care clinic for women in midlife, at **56 years old**. It has raised over $100 million in funding.
* **Julie Bornstein (Daydream):** Co-founded Daydream, an AI-powered shopping platform, at **54 years old**. It has raised over $50 million in seed funding.
* **Sara Schiller (Sloomoo Institute):** Co-founded Sloomoo Institute, a multi-city experiential brand, at **54 years old**.
* **Jaleh Bisharat (NakedPoppy):** Co-founded the clean beauty brand NakedPoppy at **59 years old**, after a career in major tech companies like Amazon.
* **Bridget Johns (To&From):** Started To&From, a gifting platform, at **55 years old**. Her company recently secured $1 million in seed funding and projects significant revenue growth.
* **Dr. Carmen Hijosa (Ananas Anam):** Founded Ananas Anam, the company behind Piñatex (a sustainable textile made from pineapple leaf fibers), at **60 years old**.

**Why Older Founders Often Succeed:**

* **Extensive Experience:** Decades of professional experience provide a deep understanding of industries, markets, and customer needs. They've likely encountered and solved many business challenges before.
* **Larger Professional Networks:** Older entrepreneurs typically have cultivated extensive networks of contacts, including potential partners, clients, investors, and mentors, which can be invaluable for a startup.
* **Financial Stability:** Many older founders have accumulated savings or established careers, providing a more stable financial foundation for their startups and reducing the pressure for immediate profitability.
* **Life Wisdom and Resilience:** They've often faced and overcome various life and career challenges, fostering resilience and a more mature approach to setbacks. They're less likely to make "rookie mistakes."
* **Better Decision-Making:** Years of experience can lead to more calculated risks, strategic hiring decisions, and a focus on building sustainable business models rather than just chasing hype.
* **Clearer Vision:** Older founders often start businesses to solve problems they've directly experienced or observed over their careers, leading to well-defined market needs and solutions.
* **"More Bites at the Apple":** While individual young founders might be celebrated, statistically, older individuals are more likely to attempt starting a company, increasing the overall pool of potential successes.

In conclusion, the narrative of the young tech prodigy is compelling, but the reality is that age is often an *advantage* in the startup world. Experience, networks, and financial stability contribute significantly to long-term success.
