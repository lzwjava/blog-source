### What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin (often abbreviated as BTC and symbolized by ₿) is the world's first and most well-known cryptocurrency—a form of digital money that exists only online, without physical coins or bills. Unlike traditional currencies like the US dollar or euro, which are controlled by governments and central banks, Bitcoin is **decentralized**. This means it's powered by a global network of computers rather than any single authority, allowing people to send value directly to each other over the internet without needing banks or intermediaries.

#### A Quick History
Bitcoin was invented in October 2008 through a whitepaper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System," authored by an anonymous individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The network went live in January 2009 with the mining of the first block, called the "genesis block," which included a headline from The Times newspaper: "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks." This was a nod to the 2008 financial crisis and Bitcoin's goal of creating a trustless alternative to fiat money. Since then, it has grown from an obscure experiment into a multi-trillion-dollar asset class, inspiring thousands of other cryptocurrencies.

#### How Does It Work?
At its core, Bitcoin runs on **blockchain technology**—a public, tamper-resistant digital ledger that records all transactions in "blocks" linked together chronologically. Here's a simplified breakdown:

- **Transactions**: When you send Bitcoin, the details (like amount and recipient's wallet address) are broadcast to the network.
- **Verification**: "Miners" (people or companies with powerful computers) compete to validate transactions by solving complex cryptographic puzzles. This process, called proof-of-work, secures the network and adds new blocks to the chain every ~10 minutes.
- **Wallets and Keys**: Users store Bitcoin in digital wallets, protected by private keys (like super-secure passwords). You can buy, sell, or trade it on exchanges like Coinbase or Binance.
- **Supply Limit**: There's a hard cap of 21 million Bitcoins that can ever exist, making it scarce by design—about 19.7 million are in circulation as of 2025.

Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature (transactions are public but tied to wallet addresses, not real names) enhances privacy, but it's not fully anonymous.

#### Uses and Risks
- **Payments**: It's accepted by some merchants (e.g., Microsoft, Overstock) for goods and services, though volatility makes it less common for everyday spending.
- **Investment**: Many view it as "digital gold"—a hedge against inflation or a speculative asset. Its price has swung wildly: from pennies in 2010 to peaks over $69,000 in 2021, and recently surpassing $125,000 in October 2025.
- **Challenges**: It's energy-intensive (mining uses massive electricity), faces regulatory scrutiny, and is prone to hacks or scams. As of early October 2025, one Bitcoin trades at around $123,000 USD, up significantly from earlier in the year.

Bitcoin has revolutionized finance by proving that money can be programmable and borderless, but it's still experimental—invest only what you can afford to lose.
