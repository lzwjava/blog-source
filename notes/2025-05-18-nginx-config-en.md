Using `server_name 0.0.0.0` in your Nginx configuration is not the correct approach, as `server_name` is meant to match domain names or hostnames, not IP addresses. Additionally, `0.0.0.0` is a special address that means "listen on all interfaces," which is handled by the `listen` directive, not `server_name`. Since the IP address of your laptop (the server) changes dynamically, you need a solution that accommodates this. Below are steps to fix your Nginx configuration and handle the dynamic IP issue effectively.

### Problem
Your laptop's IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.27`) changes due to DHCP, but you want your Nginx server to reliably serve movie files regardless of the IP address. Hardcoding the IP in the `server_name` directive or client configuration causes issues when the IP changes.

### Solution
To make your Nginx server work seamlessly despite the changing IP, you can use one or more of the following approaches:

#### 1. Use a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) or Local Hostname
Instead of relying on the IP address, use a hostname for your server. This can be achieved by:
- **Using the laptop's hostname**: Most operating systems assign a default hostname (e.g., `mylaptop.local` on macOS or `mylaptop` on Linux/Windows). You can use this in your Nginx `server_name` and access the server via the hostname.
- **Setting up a local DNS or mDNS**: Use a service like Avahi (for Linux) or Bonjour (for macOS/Windows) to resolve the laptop’s hostname locally (e.g., `mylaptop.local`).
- **Using a DDNS service**: If you need access from outside your local network, services like No-IP or DynDNS can assign a domain name (e.g., `mymovies.ddns.net`) that tracks your laptop’s IP, even if it changes.

**Nginx Configuration Example**:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mylaptop.local; # Use the laptop's hostname or DDNS name
    root /path/to/movies;
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; # Adjust as needed for your setup
    }
}
```
- Replace `mylaptop.local` with your laptop’s actual hostname or DDNS name.
- On clients, access the server via `http://mylaptop.local` instead of the IP address.

**How to Find Your Laptop’s Hostname**:
- Linux/macOS: Run `hostname` in a terminal.
- Windows: Run `hostname` in Command Prompt or check in Settings > System > About.
- Ensure your network supports mDNS (most home routers do via Bonjour/Avahi).

#### 2. Bind Nginx to All Interfaces
If you want Nginx to listen on all available IP addresses (useful when the IP changes), configure the `listen` directive to use `0.0.0.0` or omit the address entirely (Nginx defaults to all interfaces).

**Nginx Configuration Example**:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80; # Listens on all interfaces (equivalent to 0.0.0.0:80)
    server_name _; # Matches any hostname or IP
    root /path/to/movies;
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```
- `listen 80`: Binds to all interfaces, so the server responds to requests on any IP assigned to the laptop.
- `server_name _`: A catch-all that matches any hostname or IP used to access the server.
- Clients can access the server using any of the laptop’s current IPs (e.g., `http://192.168.1.27` or `http://192.168.1.28`) or the hostname.

#### 3. Assign a Static IP to the Laptop
To avoid the IP address changing, configure your laptop to use a static IP address within your local network (e.g., `192.168.1.27`). This can be done via:
- **Router settings**: Reserve an IP for your laptop’s MAC address in your router’s DHCP settings (often called “DHCP reservation”).
- **Laptop network settings**: Manually set a static IP outside the DHCP range (e.g., `192.168.1.200`) in your laptop’s network configuration.

Once the IP is static, update your Nginx configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 192.168.1.27:80; # Bind to the static IP
    server_name 192.168.1.27; # Optional, if clients use the IP directly
    root /path/to/movies;
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```
- Clients access the server via `http://192.168.1.27`.

#### 4. Use a Reverse Proxy or Load Balancer (Advanced)
If you have multiple servers or want a more robust setup, you can set up a reverse proxy (e.g., another Nginx instance) on a device with a static IP that forwards requests to your laptop. The proxy can use the laptop’s hostname or dynamically resolve its IP.

### Recommended Approach
For simplicity, I recommend **Option 1 (Using the laptop’s hostname)** or **Option 2 (Binding to all interfaces)**:
- **Option 1** is ideal if your network supports mDNS and you want a user-friendly URL (e.g., `http://mylaptop.local`). It requires minimal configuration and works well for local networks.
- **Option 2** is best if you don’t want to rely on hostnames and are okay with clients using the current IP (which you can find via `ip addr` or `ifconfig` on the laptop).

### Steps to Implement
1. **Edit Nginx Configuration**:
   - Open your Nginx config file (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` or `/etc/nginx/conf.d/movies.conf`).
   - Apply one of the configurations above (e.g., use `server_name mylaptop.local` or `server_name _` with `listen 80`).
   - Save the file.

2. **Test the Configuration**:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```
   Ensure there are no syntax errors.

3. **Reload Nginx**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```
   Or, if `systemctl` isn’t available:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -s reload
   ```

4. **Test Access**:
   - From a client device, access the server using the hostname (e.g., `http://mylaptop.local`) or the laptop’s current IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.27`).
   - Verify that movie files are served correctly.

5. **Optional: Check Laptop’s IP**:
   If you need to find the laptop’s current IP:
   - Linux/macOS: `ip addr show` or `ifconfig`.
   - Windows: `ipconfig` in Command Prompt.

### Additional Tips
- **Firewall**: Ensure the laptop’s firewall allows HTTP traffic on port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS). For example, on Linux with `ufw`:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
  ```
- **File Permissions**: Verify that Nginx has permission to read the movie files:
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/movies
  sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/movies
  ```
  (Adjust `www-data` to the user Nginx runs as, e.g., `nginx` on some systems.)
- **HTTPS (Optional)**: For security, consider setting up HTTPS with a self-signed certificate or Let’s Encrypt, especially if accessing the server outside your local network.
- **Debugging**: If the server isn’t accessible, check Nginx logs:
  ```bash
  sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
  sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
  ```

### Why `server_name 0.0.0.0` Doesn’t Work
- `server_name` is used to match the `Host` header in HTTP requests, not to specify the listening interface. Setting `server_name 0.0.0.0` would expect clients to send a `Host: 0.0.0.0` header, which they won’t.
- To listen on all interfaces, use `listen 0.0.0.0:80` (or just `listen 80`), and to match any hostname, use `server_name _`.

### Final Configuration Example (Simplest)
For a local movie server that works regardless of IP changes:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;
    root /path/to/movies;
    location / {
        autoindex on; # Enables directory listing for easy browsing
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```
- Save, test, and reload Nginx as described above.
- Access via `http://<laptop-ip>` or `http://<laptop-hostname>`.

This setup ensures your movie server remains accessible even when the laptop’s IP changes, without relying on a specific IP in the configuration.
