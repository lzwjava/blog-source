title: Optimizing Cron and GitHub Workflow Efficiency
translated: false

That's a solid optimization! Switching your cron schedule to `'0 */2 * * *'` (every 2 hours) strikes a nice balance between keeping things fresh—especially for accumulating those AI-generated notes without letting them balloon to 3000+ per year—and staying well under GitHub's 2000-minute monthly limit for free accounts. Commenting out paths like `original/**` and `_posts/**` (while keeping the core ones like `_layouts/**`, `_includes/**`, etc.) ensures the workflow only triggers on meaningful changes, reducing unnecessary runs.

If your repo involves a Jekyll site or similar (given the `_config.yml` and `_sass/**` paths), this setup should keep deploys lean. A couple of quick tips to stretch those minutes even further:
- **Add a `concurrency` block** to your workflow YAML to cancel in-progress runs if a new one starts (e.g., for overlapping schedule/push events):
  ```yaml
  concurrency:
    group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
    cancel-in-progress: true
  ```
- **Monitor usage** via GitHub's settings > Billing > Usage—set up a simple script or alert if you hit ~1500 minutes to catch spikes early.
- If note accumulation is the main driver, consider filtering the schedule trigger further with a `if` condition based on recent commits to AI-related paths (e.g., `scripts/llm/**`).

Overall, great move—it's efficient without sacrificing the value from those AI insights. If you share the full workflow file or want help tweaking it more, I'm here!
