### What is Non-JUPAS?

In the context of Hong Kong university admissions, **JUPAS** (Joint University Programmes Admissions System) is the centralized application platform primarily for local Hong Kong students. It allows them to apply to publicly funded universities using their Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) results. It's like a unified system where students list program preferences, and universities allocate spots based on scores and quotas.

**Non-JUPAS**, on the other hand, refers to the **alternative admission route** for everyone else:
- **Non-local students** (e.g., mainland Chinese, international applicants from overseas).
- **Local Hong Kong students** who don't use HKDSE (e.g., those with International Baccalaureate (IB), GCE A-Levels, SAT/AP, or other qualifications).
- **Post-secondary applicants** (e.g., those with associate degrees, diplomas, or sub-degrees like your GDUFS self-study program).

Under non-JUPAS:
- Applications are made **directly to each university** (no central system).
- Deadlines and requirements vary by institution (e.g., transcripts, English tests like IELTS, personal statements, interviews).
- It's more flexible but competitive, with holistic evaluation beyond just exam scores.
- For undergrad programs, it can lead to Year 1 entry (full 4-year degree) or senior-year entry (2–3 years if credits transfer).

This route is ideal for self-studied or non-standard qualifications, as in your case—universities like HKU, CUHK, and CityU explicitly welcome it for mainland/post-secondary applicants.
