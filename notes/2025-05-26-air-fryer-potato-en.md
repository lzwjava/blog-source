To cook potatoes in an air fryer, follow these steps for crispy, delicious results:

1. **Choose and Prep Potatoes**:
   - Select potatoes like Russet, Yukon Gold, or red potatoes. For fries or wedges, cut into even pieces (about 1/2-inch thick). For roasted potatoes, cut into 1-inch chunks. Leave small potatoes whole or halve them.
   - Wash and scrub thoroughly. Peel if desired, but skin-on adds texture.
   - Pat dry with a paper towel to ensure crispiness.

2. **Season**:
   - Toss potatoes in a bowl with 1-2 tablespoons of oil (olive, avocado, or vegetable) per pound of potatoes.
   - Add seasonings: salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, or herbs like rosemary or thyme. About 1 teaspoon of each per pound works well.

3. **Preheat Air Fryer**:
   - Set your air fryer to 400°F (200°C). Preheating for 3-5 minutes is optional but helps with even cooking.

4. **Cook**:
   - Place potatoes in the air fryer basket in a single layer. Avoid overcrowding for maximum crispiness.
   - Cook times depend on the cut:
     - **Fries or wedges**: 15-20 minutes, shaking the basket every 5-7 minutes.
     - **Chunks or cubes**: 12-18 minutes, shaking halfway.
     - **Whole small potatoes**: 20-25 minutes, flipping once.
   - Check for doneness: potatoes should be golden and crispy outside, tender inside. Add 2-5 minutes if needed.

5. **Serve**:
   - Remove and serve immediately. Optionally, sprinkle with extra salt or fresh herbs.

**Tips**:
- **Soak for Fries**: For extra-crispy fries, soak cut potatoes in cold water for 20-30 minutes to remove excess starch, then dry thoroughly before seasoning.
- **Don’t Overfill**: Cook in batches if necessary to avoid steaming.
- **Experiment**: Try adding parmesan, cayenne, or ranch seasoning for variety.
