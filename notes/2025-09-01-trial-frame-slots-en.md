Good question — this is about the **trial frame design** itself, not the PD numbers.

### Three Insertion Slots

* A **trial frame with three insertion slots per eye** means each eye can hold up to three lenses at the same time.
* For example, the optician might insert:

  1. A spherical lens (basic myopia or hyperopia correction)
  2. A cylindrical lens (astigmatism correction)
  3. A prism lens (if needed, or an additional test lens such as progressive trial lens)
* This allows the optician to simulate your full prescription without needing to grind a custom lens first.

### Four Insertion Slots

* Yes, **four-slot trial frames exist** (less common, but available in professional optometry sets).
* They give more flexibility, such as adding a tinted filter, polarizer, or progressive test lens in addition to the regular correction lenses.
* They’re bulkier and heavier, so usually used in clinics rather than for simple home testing.

### How to Choose

* **Three-slot trial frames** are standard and enough for almost all testing.
* If you only want to try progressive lenses for comfort and corridor fit, three slots are completely sufficient.
* **Four-slot frames** are mostly useful for professional optometrists who need to layer extra test lenses.

👉 For personal or “try-before-you-buy” progressive lens use, I’d recommend **three-slot adjustable PD frames** (lighter, cheaper, easier). Four-slot is overkill unless you’re setting up a small optometry lab.

Would you like me to list the **typical product names/keywords** for three-slot vs four-slot frames (like how they appear on Amazon or optical supply sites)?
