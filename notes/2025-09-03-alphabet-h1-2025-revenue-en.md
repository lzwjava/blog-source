title: Alphabet Hits $186.66B in H1 2025
translated: false
---

Here’s the revenue for Alphabet (Google’s parent company) in the **first half of 2025**:

* **Q1 2025 (ended March 31)**: Alphabet reported revenue of **\$90.23 billion**, representing a 12% year-over-year increase ([Alphabet Investor Relations][1]).
* **Q2 2025 (ended June 30)**: Revenue came in at **\$96.43 billion**, rising 14% year-over-year ([Alphabet Investor Relations][2]).

Adding those two quarter revenues gives the **total for the first half of 2025**:

**\$90.23 B + \$96.43 B = \$186.66 billion**

This aligns with multiple sources:

* One analysis reported **\$186.7 billion** in H1 revenue, up 12.9% YoY ([SEC][3], [Voronoi App][4]).
* Another confirmed **\$186.662 billion** for H1 2025, a 12.94% year-over-year increase ([AInvest][5]).
