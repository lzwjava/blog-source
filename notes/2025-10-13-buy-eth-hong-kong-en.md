### Transaction Time for Buying ETH (Ethereum) at CoinUnit ATM in Hong Kong

Since you clarified "no eth" but the context suggests you likely meant **ETH (Ethereum)** instead of ETC (Ethereum Classic) from the previous query, I’ll provide the estimated time for purchasing ETH using a CoinUnit (CoinUnited.io) ATM in Hong Kong, based on available information and general crypto ATM operations as of October 2025.

#### Overall Process Time:
- **End-to-End (Cash to Wallet Receipt)**: Typically **3-10 minutes**.
  - **ATM Interaction**: 1-2 minutes – Scan your Ethereum wallet QR code, insert cash (HKD), confirm the rate, and receive a transaction ID/receipt.
  - **Crypto Dispatch**: Near-instant to 3 minutes – CoinUnit ATMs, powered by General Bytes, process transactions quickly, sending ETH to your wallet address after cash verification.
  - **First Confirmation**: 1-5 minutes on average – Ethereum’s blockchain has block times of ~12-15 seconds, so under normal conditions, you’ll see the ETH in your wallet as "confirmed" within a few minutes.

#### Key Factors Affecting Time:
- **Network Congestion**: Ethereum’s blockchain is generally fast, but during high traffic (e.g., heavy DeFi activity), confirmations might take 5-10 minutes. Check real-time network status on explorers like [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) for gas fees and confirmation times.
- **Transaction Size and KYC**: Smaller transactions (e.g., < HKD 10,000) typically require minimal or no ID verification, keeping the process under 5 minutes. Larger amounts may need ID scans, adding 1-2 minutes.
- **Wallet Setup**: Use a compatible ETH wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Coinbase Wallet) with a scannable QR code for quick input. Ensure your wallet is set up to receive ETH to avoid delays.

#### User Experience and Comparisons:
- CoinUnit ATMs are noted for speed and user-friendliness, with reviews calling transactions “fast” and “seamless.” ETH, alongside BTC and USDT, is a core offering, benefiting from their reliable General Bytes hardware.
- Compared to competitors like Localcoin or HK Bitcoin ATM, CoinUnit’s ETH purchase process is similarly efficient, often faster than BTC due to Ethereum’s quicker block times.
- No widespread reports of delays or issues with CoinUnit ATMs for ETH specifically, based on available feedback.

#### Recommendations:
- **Start Small**: Test with a small transaction to confirm the process and wallet compatibility.
- **Monitor Network**: Use a blockchain explorer like Etherscan to track your transaction if it doesn’t appear within 10 minutes.
- **Contact Support**: If ETH doesn’t show up within 15-20 minutes, contact CoinUnit’s 24/7 support via [coinunit.io](https://coinunit.io) with your transaction ID.

If you meant a different coin (e.g., ETC or something else) or have specific details (like selling ETH or a particular ATM location), please clarify, and I’ll provide a more targeted response!
