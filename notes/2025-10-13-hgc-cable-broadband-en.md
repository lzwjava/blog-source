### What is HK HGC Cable?

HGC (HGC Global Communications Limited) is a leading fixed-line telecommunications operator and internet service provider (ISP) based in Hong Kong. Originally part of Hutchison Telecommunications, it provides a range of broadband services, including cable internet (often referred to as "HGC Cable") and fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) options. Their cable broadband plans typically offer speeds up to 100 Mbps (e.g., 100M Superbroadband), while their fiber plans go up to 1 Gbps (1000M). HGC owns an extensive fiber-optic network in Hong Kong and connects to global submarine and terrestrial cables for international routing. It's popular for residential and business users, focusing on reliable connectivity, data centers, and ICT solutions.

### How Does It Show in Speedtest (Servers)?

In Ookla's Speedtest.net, HGC's dedicated server appears as **HGC Global Communications Limited** and is located in **Shatin, Hong Kong**. This server (with the hostname `ookla-speedtest.hgconair.hgc.com.hk`) is used to test speeds specifically on the HGC network, helping users verify their connection quality without external factors. When you run a test on Speedtest.net from an HGC connection in Hong Kong, it will often auto-select this server for the most accurate local results.

HGC also offers a custom Speedtest tool tailored for their users at [hgcbroadband.speedtestcustom.com](http://hgcbroadband.speedtestcustom.com/), which defaults to their Sha Tin server. For official performance monitoring, HGC subscribers can use their "Speed Meter" tool, which connects to designated servers to guarantee speeds as per their plan (e.g., for 100 Mbps plans). In broader Hong Kong Speedtest reports, HGC ranks competitively, with median download speeds around 98-100 Mbps based on recent user tests.

If you're troubleshooting speeds, ensure you're testing via the HGC-specific server to isolate network issues.
