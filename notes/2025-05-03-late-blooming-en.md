Success in science, engineering, STEM fields, or business is not limited by age. Many individuals have made significant contributions or achieved notable success in their late 50s or 60s. Below are examples of such people, including Yitang Zhang, as you mentioned, spanning various fields.

### Examples of Late-Blooming Success

1. **Yitang Zhang (Mathematics)**  
   At the age of 57, Yitang Zhang made a groundbreaking contribution to number theory by proving a weak version of the twin prime conjecture. His work, published in the *Annals of Mathematics* in 2013, earned him widespread recognition, including the MacArthur Fellowship. Before this achievement, Zhang was relatively unknown, making his success a remarkable testament to perseverance in later years.

2. **Barbara McClintock (Genetics)**  
   Barbara McClintock won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983 at the age of 81 for her discovery of transposable elements in maize, also known as "jumping genes." While much of her key research occurred earlier, her recognition and the Nobel award came much later, highlighting how scientific impact can be acknowledged in one’s later years.

3. **Charles Kettering (Engineering)**  
   In his 50s, Charles Kettering invented the electric starter for automobiles, eliminating the need for hand-cranking engines. He also developed leaded gasoline and the first aerial torpedo, significantly influencing automotive and military technology. His innovations show how engineering breakthroughs can emerge from seasoned expertise.

4. **John Goodenough (Physics/Chemistry)**  
   At the age of 57, John Goodenough co-invented the lithium-ion battery, a technology that powers modern electronics like smartphones and electric vehicles. His work in the late 1970s and beyond has had a lasting impact on energy storage, earning him a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019 at age 97.

5. **Ray Kroc (Business)**  
   Ray Kroc was in his 50s when he bought McDonald's from the McDonald brothers in 1961 and transformed it into a global fast-food empire. His vision and business strategies revolutionized the industry, proving that entrepreneurial success can take off later in life.

6. **Harland Sanders (Business)**  
   At the age of 65, Harland Sanders founded Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) by franchising his unique chicken recipe. After years of working various jobs, he built a thriving business that became a global brand, demonstrating that determination can lead to success even in one’s 60s.

### Conclusion
These individuals—Yitang Zhang, Barbara McClintock, Charles Kettering, John Goodenough, Ray Kroc, and Harland Sanders—illustrate that significant achievements in science, engineering, STEM fields, or business can occur in one’s late 50s or 60s. Their stories serve as inspiring examples that age is no barrier to making a lasting impact or realizing one’s potential.

### Science

- **Peter Higgs (Physics)**  
  Peter Higgs proposed the Higgs boson particle in 1964 when he was in his 30s, but his theory wasn’t confirmed until 2012, when he was 83, with the particle’s discovery at CERN. In 2013, at age 84, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics, proving that scientific recognition can come late in life.

- **Barbara Liskov (Computer Science)**  
  Barbara Liskov made groundbreaking contributions to programming languages and software design, including the Liskov substitution principle, developed in her 50s. She won the Turing Award in 2008 at age 69, cementing her legacy as a pioneer in modern computing.

### Engineering

- **Robert Noyce (Semiconductor Engineering)**  
  Robert Noyce co-invented the integrated circuit in his 30s, but his most transformative work came later. At 41, he co-founded Intel, and by his 50s, he was leading the company to revolutionize the semiconductor industry, shaping today’s technology landscape.

- **Isambard Kingdom Brunel (Civil Engineering)**  
  Brunel was a prolific engineer whose career peaked in his later years. In his 50s, he designed the *SS Great Eastern*, a monumental ship, and completed iconic projects like bridges and railways that influenced engineering long after his death at 53.

### STEM Fields

- **Grace Hopper (Computer Science)**  
  Grace Hopper invented one of the first compiler-related tools in her 40s and co-developed the COBOL programming language. She remained a key figure in computing, retiring from the U.S. Navy at 79 as a rear admiral and staying active in the field until her death at 85.

- **John Glenn (Aerospace)**  
  John Glenn orbited Earth in 1962 at 40, but his later achievement was even more remarkable. In 1998, at age 77, he flew aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, becoming the oldest person in space and contributing to research on aging.

### Business

- **Warren Buffett (Finance/Investing)**  
  Warren Buffett began investing early, but he didn’t become a billionaire until his 50s. His wealth and influence grew exponentially in his later decades, and now in his 90s, he’s one of history’s most successful investors.

- **Vera Wang (Fashion/Design)**  
  Vera Wang transitioned to fashion design in her 40s after careers in skating and journalism. By her 50s, she had built a globally celebrated brand, particularly in bridal wear, showing that a late career shift can lead to extraordinary success.

- **John Pemberton (Entrepreneurship)**  
  At 55, John Pemberton invented Coca-Cola in 1886. Though he didn’t witness its worldwide dominance, his creation became a cornerstone of modern business.

- **Henry Ford (Automotive Industry)**  
  Henry Ford launched the Model T in his 40s, but in his 50s, he introduced the moving assembly line, transforming manufacturing and making automobiles widely accessible.

- **Sam Walton (Retail)**  
  Sam Walton founded Walmart at 44, but its massive growth occurred in his 50s and 60s. By his late 60s, Walmart was the U.S.’s largest retailer, highlighting how business success can peak later in life.
