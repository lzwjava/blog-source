title: Vue.js Live Stream Intro Component
translated: false
---

Below is a detailed, section-by-section explanation of the provided code. This appears to be a Vue.js component (likely Vue 1.x or early Vue 2.x, given the syntax like `v-bind:class` and `this.$router.go`) for an introductory page of a live streaming event (e.g., on a platform like a Chinese live-streaming app integrated with WeChat). I'll break it down into its key parts: the **template** (HTML-like structure), **script** (JavaScript logic), and **styles** (CSS via Stylus). I'll describe what each part does, how it interacts, and its purpose in the overall component.

If you're new to Vue, think of this as a reusable UI "component" that displays live stream details, handles user interactions (e.g., joining, paying), and integrates with WeChat for sharing and payments. The code assumes dependencies like WeChat SDK, utility functions, and API calls for fetching live stream data.

### Overall Purpose
- **What it does**: This is the "IntroView" component, which renders a page for a specific live stream event. It shows details like the stream's cover, owner, schedule, attendees, description, and options to join (e.g., via payment or sharing). It integrates with WeChat for mobile features like sharing, payments, and QR code generation.
- **Key features**:
  - Fetches and displays live stream data (e.g., title, participants, details in Markdown).
  - Handles user actions: attending/joining, paying (via WeChat), sharing on WeChat timeline, or generating QR codes for payment outside WeChat.
  - Supports overlays for options (e.g., direct sign-up vs. share-to-join), toasts for feedback (e.g., loading, success), and navigation to related pages (e.g., user profiles, invite lists).
  - Responsive design for mobile (likely iOS/Android via WeChat).
  - No direct security concerns in this code (e.g., no disallowed activities), but it deals with payments and user data.
- **Integration**: Uses WeChat SDK for sharing, payment, and image previews. Relies on external APIs (via `http` module) and router for navigation. Data is reactive (Vue style), updating on route changes.

The code is a single file combining template, script, and styles.

### 1. **Template** (HTML-Like Structure)
The `<template>` defines the UI layout using Vue's directives (e.g., `v-for` for loops, `:src` for dynamic attributes). It's divided into sections that visually organize the live stream's details.

- **Root Element**: `<div class="intro-view">` – The main container for the entire page.
  
- **Navigation**: `<list-nav :mode="0" :title="introTitle" :live-id="liveId"></list-nav>` – A custom component for navigation, passing the live title (computed as `${live.owner.username}的直播`) and ID.

- **Cover Section**: 
  - `<img class="cover-img" :src="live.coverUrl" alt="cover" @click="clickCover"/>` – Displays the live stream's cover image. Clicking it triggers `clickCover()`, which may initiate attend/join flow.

- **Header Section**: `<div class="header-section card-group">`
  - **User Avatar**: `<user-avatar :user="live.owner"></user-avatar>` – Shows the stream owner's avatar.
  - **Details**: Subject (title) and owner name. Owner name is clickable to go to their profile.
  - **Time and Status**: Shows scheduled time, time gap (e.g., "live in 2 hours"), and status (e.g., "LIVE" if airing, styled with classes).

- **Attendance Summary**: `<div class="attend-summary-section card-group" @click="goUsers">`
  - Lists up to a few attended users' avatars and a summary (e.g., "X人已参与 >"). Clickable to view all attendees.

- **Invite Summary**: Similar to attendance, but for an "invite leaderboard" – shows invited users' avatars and a label ("邀请榜>"). Clickable to view invites.

- **Speaker Intro** (Conditional): `<div class="speaker-section card-group" v-show="live.speakerIntro">` – If the stream has a speaker intro, displays it in Markdown (e.g., bio/details).

- **Live Details**: `<div class="detail-section card-group">` – Renders the full live stream description in Markdown, with image preview support (via WeChat SDK for zooming images).

- **Copyright Info**: `<div class="copyright-section card-group">` – Hardcoded text about video copyright, rendered in Markdown.

- **More Lives**: `<div class="lives-section card-group">` – Shows a list of recommended live streams (via `recommend-live-list` component).

- **Attend Section** (Fixed at bottom):
  - **Left Buttons**: Conditional buttons for "发起直播" (start a live, if not owner) or "编辑介绍页" (edit page, if owner).
  - **Main Attend Button**: Dynamic text (computed `btnTitle`) based on status (e.g., "报名参与直播" for free sign-up, or "赞助并参与直播 ￥X" for paid). Handles join/pay logic.
  
- **Overlays and Toasts**:
  - `<overlay>`: For modal popups (e.g., payment options, share prompts, QR code for payment).
  - `<toast>`: Loading/Success/error messages.

Key Interactions:
- Clicks trigger methods like `goUsers`, `attendLive`, etc.
- Dynamic classes (e.g., `live-on` for active status) and computed values (e.g., `timeGap`, `statusText`) make it reactive.

### 2. **Script** (JavaScript Logic)
This is the Vue component's logic, handling data, computations, lifecycle, methods, and events.

- **Imports**:
  - `wx from 'weixin-js-sdk'`: WeChat SDK for sharing, payments, etc.
  - Components like `UserAvatar`, `Markdown` (for rendering Markdown), `Overlay` (modals), etc.
  - `util`, `http`, `wechat`: Custom modules for utilities (e.g., loading states, API calls), HTTP requests, and WeChat-specific functions (e.g., sharing).

- **Component Definition**:
  - `name: 'IntroView'`: Component name.
  - `components`: Registers imported child components.

- **Data Properties** (Reactive State):
  - `live`: Object holding live stream details (e.g., owner, subject, status, attendance count, payment info via `needPay`).
  - `attendedUsers`, `invites`: Arrays of users (attendees/invites) for display.
  - `curUser`: Current logged-in user's info.
  - `overlayStatus`: Controls overlay visibility.
  - `qrcodeUrl`: For QR code payments.
  - Other flags: `positiveShare` (user-initiated sharing), etc.

- **Computed Properties** (Derived Reactive Data):
  - `options`: Dynamic array for overlay prompt (e.g., ["直接报名", "分享朋友圈报名(感谢您)"] based on payment).
  - `btnTitle`: Generates button text dynamically (e.g., includes price if `needPay`, status like "参与直播" or "收看回播").
  - `timeGap`: Shows time until start (via utility).
  - `statusText`: Status description (e.g., "正在直播").
  - `introTitle`: Page title.
  - `thankWord()`: Returns "免费" or "感恩1元" for low-cost shares.

- **Route Data** (Lifecycle on Route Change):
  - Loads data for the `liveId` from URL params. If it's the same `liveId`, just refreshes share config; otherwise, fetches all data via `loadAllData()` (which calls APIs for live details, users, invites, current user, and WeChat config).
  - Enables WeChat sharing for the live stream.

- **Methods** (Functions):
  - **Data Loading & Setup**: `loadAllData()` – Fetches live info, attendees, invites, user data, and sets up WeChat (sharing, image previews).
  - **User Actions**:
    - `attendLive()`: Core flow – Checks login, WeChat subscription, then attends/pays based on `canJoin`, `needPay`, etc. Handles overlays for options or QR codes.
    - `payOrCreateAttend()`: Branches to payment or free sign-up.
    - `pay()`: Initiates WeChat payment or QR code.
    - `createAttend()`: Free sign-up, records from invite link if applicable.
    - `reloadLive()`: Refreshes live data after actions.
  - **Navigation**: Helpers like `goUsers()`, `goInvite()`, `goUserRoom(userId)` (via `$router.go()`).
  - **Utilities**: `moneyToYuan()` (converts cents to yuan), `cleanFromUserId()` (clears localStorage invite tracking), `thankWord()`, `configPreviewImages()` (sets up WeChat image zooming), `playVideo()` (handles video playback, though no video element is in the template – optional feature?).
  - **Other**: `editLive()`, `createLive()`, `intoLive()` (enter the live stream), `fetchQrcodeUrlAndShow()` (shows QR for non-WeChat payments).

- **Events** (Global Event Handlers):
  - `shareTimeline`: Fired after WeChat share – Updates share data, shows toast, and potentially reloads/attends.
  - `hideOptionsForm`: Handles overlay selections (e.g., direct attend vs. share).
  - `payFinish`: Reloads and enters live after payment.
  - `updateCurUser`: Refreshes data on user changes.

- **Destroyed Hook**: Logs destruction (debugging).

### 3. **Styles** (Stylus CSS)
This uses Stylus (a concise CSS preprocessor) to style the component. Key rules:

- **Base**: Imports shared styles (e.g., `base.styl`, `variables.styl`). Responsive breakpoints via `rupture`.
- **Layout**:
  - `.intro-view`: Full-width container.
  - Sections (e.g., `.header-section`, `.cover-section`): Padding, backgrounds, flex layouts.
  - Avatars: Fixed sizes (e.g., 80px for header, 25px for lists).
  - Buttons: Fixed bottom bar (55px height), with flex for left/right. Colors: Blue for attend (#00BDEF), gray/green for others.
  - Conditional styles: `.live-on` for status (blue background).
  - Text: Fonts, colors (gray #828282), line heights for readability.
  - Lists: Inline avatars for attendees/invites.
- **Interactions**: Hover-like clicks, image responsiveness.
- **Mobile-First**: Flexbox for layout, covers, fixed bottom for buttons. Max-width 700px on larger screens.

### How It All Works Together
1. **Loading**: On route enter, fetches data from APIs (e.g., live details, attendees) and sets up WeChat sharing.
2. **Display**: Renders sections with dynamic content (e.g., Markdown for details, computed button text).
3. **Interaction**: User clicks "attend" → Checks auth/payment → Shows overlay/options → Pay via WeChat/QR or free sign-up → Enters live.
4. **Updates**: Reactive data (e.g., `live.canJoin`) changes UI/buttons. Events handle async actions like shares/payments.
5. **Edge Cases**: Handles non-WeChat browsers (QR fallback), unpaid shares, time status, etc.

This is a polished, feature-rich component for live stream intros, emphasizing social/payment integration. If you have specific questions (e.g., about a method or debugging an issue), let me know! If this is code you're working with, note that Vue 1.x is deprecated—consider upgrading to Vue 3 for modern features.
