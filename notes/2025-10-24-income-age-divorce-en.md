### Divorce Rates by Income and Age: Key Insights

Yes, research consistently shows that middle-income (or higher) couples experience lower divorce rates compared to low-income or poor young families. Lower socioeconomic status—often tied to poverty or working-class backgrounds—correlates with higher marital instability, especially among younger adults (e.g., ages 18–35). This pattern holds even when controlling for factors like education and marriage timing. Factors contributing to this include financial stress, limited access to resources (like counseling), and earlier childbearing outside marriage, which strain young low-income relationships more severely.

#### Why Poor Young Families Face Higher Divorce Risks
- **Financial Strain**: Low-income households often deal with economic pressures like job instability, debt, and housing costs, which erode relationship quality and increase conflict.
- **Younger Age at Marriage/Parenthood**: Couples marrying or starting families in their early 20s (common in low-income groups) have divorce rates up to 60% within 10 years, compared to 24% less likelihood if waiting until after 25.
- **Selection Effects**: Fewer low-income people marry at all today, but those who do are often in more fragile unions due to socioeconomic challenges.

#### Comparison of Divorce Rates
Here's a summary table of key statistics from recent studies (focusing on U.S. data for adults aged 18–55, unless noted):

| Socioeconomic Group | Ever-Divorced Rate (Among Ever-Married) | Notes on Young Couples (Under 35) |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Poor/Low-Income** | 41–46% | 50%+ of young poor adults are single or cohabiting; 5x higher nonmarital births, leading to quicker breakups. |
| **Working-Class**   | 40–45% | 44% of millennial working-class (28–34) have children pre-marriage; divorce risk ~3x higher than middle-class peers. |
| **Middle/Upper-Income** | 15–30% | Only 15% 10-year divorce rate for college-educated (proxy for middle-class); stability rises with income above $50K. |

These figures show a clear gradient: divorce probability drops by 25% or more as household wealth or income rises from $0 to $100K+, flattening around $200K. For young families specifically, low-income couples under 30 have the highest breakup rates (up to 50% within a decade), while middle-income ones benefit from delayed marriage and better financial buffers.

In short, middle-income stability is real—poorer young families do face easier paths to divorce due to intertwined economic and life-stage pressures. If you're navigating this personally, resources like financial counseling can help mitigate risks.
