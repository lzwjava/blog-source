### Creating an API Gateway in Azure Using API Management

Azure API Management (APIM) is the fully managed service that acts as an API gateway, providing features like API publishing, security, analytics, and developer portals. Below is a step-by-step guide to create an APIM instance via the Azure portal.

#### Prerequisites
- An active Azure subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

#### Steps to Create an API Management Instance

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**  
   Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with your Azure account.

2. **Create a New Resource**  
   - From the Azure portal menu, select **Create a resource**. (Alternatively, select **Create a resource** from the Azure Home page.)  
   - On the **Create a resource** page, search for and select **API Management** under the **Integration** category.  
   - Click **Create**.

3. **Configure the Basics**  
   On the **Create API Management** page, switch to the **Basics** tab and fill in the details:  
   | Setting              | Description                                                                 |
   |----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Subscription         | Select the Azure subscription for this instance.                            |
   | Resource group       | Choose an existing resource group or create a new one (e.g., "APIM-RG").    |
   | Region               | Pick a region close to your users or backend services (e.g., East US).      |
   | Resource name        | Enter a unique name (e.g., "my-apim-instance"). This becomes part of the default domain: `<name>.azure-api.net`. It can't be changed later. |
   | Organization name    | Your organization's name (used in developer portal and emails).             |
   | Administrator email  | Your email for system notifications.                                        |
   | Pricing tier         | Start with **Basic v2** for development/testing (quick deployment, ~30-40 minutes). Other tiers like Developer or Standard offer more features. |
   | Units                | Default to 1 for evaluation.                                                |  
   Review and proceed.

4. **Optional: Configure Monitoring and Security**  
   On the **Monitor + secure** tab:  
   - Enable optional add-ons like Log Analytics for logging (this may incur extra costs).  
   - Skip for now if just getting started.

5. **Review and Create**  
   - On the **Review + create** tab, validate your settings.  
   - Click **Create**. Deployment takes 30-40 minutes or more.  
   - Tip: Pin the resource to your dashboard for easy access once created.

6. **Verify the Instance**  
   - In the Azure portal, search for **API Management services**.  
   - Select your new instance.  
   - On the **Overview** page, confirm the status is "Online". You're now ready to import APIs, configure policies, or set up the developer portal.

#### Next Steps
- Import your first API: Follow the [tutorial to import and publish an API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/import-and-publish).  
- Secure it: Add policies for authentication, rate limiting, etc.  
- Clean up: If testing, delete the resource group via the portal to avoid charges (search for **Resource groups** > select group > **Delete resource group**).  

For custom domains or advanced configs, refer to the [APIM documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/).
