**Viva La Vida**  
*Coldplay*  

I used to rule the world  
Seas would rise when I gave the word  
Now in the morning, I sleep alone  
Sweep the streets I used to own  

I used to roll the dice  
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes  
Listen as the crowd would sing  
"Now the old king is dead, long live the king"  

One minute, I held the key  
Next, the walls were closed on me  
And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'  
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason, I can't explain  
Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word  
And that was when I ruled the world  

It was a wicked and wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I'd become  

Revolutionaries wait  
For my head on a silver plate  
Just a puppet on a lonely string  
Oh, who would ever want to be king?  

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'  
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason, I can't explain  
I know Saint Peter won't call my name  
Never an honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world  

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh  

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'  
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason, I can't explain  
I know Saint Peter won't call my name  
Never an honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world
