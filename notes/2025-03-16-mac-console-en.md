To troubleshoot the "Failed to open input stream in demuxing stream" error in Infuse, a Mac app, and view more detailed logs, you can use tools available on your Mac. Since the query mentions "iOS or Xcode tool" but specifies Infuse as a Mac app, it’s likely you want to use Xcode or related macOS tools to inspect logs for the Mac version of Infuse. Below are step-by-step instructions to help you access these logs.

### For Infuse on Mac (Primary Method: Console App)
Since Infuse is identified as a Mac app in your query, the most straightforward way to view its logs is by using the **Console** app, which is built into macOS and designed to display system and application logs.

1. **Open the Console App**:
   - Launch the **Console** app, found in **Applications** > **Utilities** > **Console**, or search for it using Spotlight (Cmd + Space, then type "Console").

2. **Filter Logs for Infuse**:
   - In the Console app, use the search bar at the top right.
   - Type "Infuse" or the app’s process name (likely "Infuse" or something similar) to filter logs related to the app.

3. **Reproduce the Error**:
   - With the Console app open and filtering active, play the video in Infuse that triggers the "Failed to open input stream in demuxing stream" error.
   - This ensures the relevant logs are captured in real time.

4. **Analyze the Logs**:
   - Look for error messages, warnings, or detailed output that might explain why the input stream failed to open during demuxing (the process of separating audio and video streams).
   - Keywords like "error," "fail," or "demux" might help pinpoint the issue.

### If You Meant the iOS Version of Infuse (Using Xcode)
If you intended to debug the iOS version of Infuse (despite the query saying "Mac app"), you can use **Xcode**, Apple’s development tool, to access logs from an iOS device. Here’s how:

1. **Connect Your iOS Device**:
   - Plug your iPhone or iPad into your Mac using a USB cable.

2. **Open Xcode**:
   - Launch **Xcode** on your Mac. If you don’t have it installed, download it from the Mac App Store.

3. **Access Devices and Simulators**:
   - In Xcode, go to **Window** > **Devices and Simulators** from the menu bar.

4. **Select Your Device**:
   - In the window that opens, find your connected iOS device in the left sidebar and click on it.

5. **View Logs**:
   - Click **Open Console** or **View Device Logs** (the option may vary by Xcode version).
   - This opens a log viewer showing all activity from your device.

6. **Filter for Infuse**:
   - Use the search or filter option in the log viewer to narrow down entries by typing "Infuse" or the app’s bundle identifier (e.g., `com.firecore.Infuse` if known).
   - Reproduce the error on your iOS device while the console is open to capture relevant logs.

### Additional Options
- **Check for Crash Reports**:
  - **Mac**: If Infuse crashes, check `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports` or `/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports` for crash logs named with "Infuse" and a timestamp.
  - **iOS**: In Xcode’s **Devices and Simulators** window, crash logs for Infuse may appear under your device’s logs.

- **Enable Debug Logging in Infuse**:
  - Some apps, including Infuse, might offer a debug mode or verbose logging option. Open Infuse’s settings or preferences on your Mac (or iOS device) to see if such a feature exists. If enabled, this could generate more detailed logs viewable via the methods above.

- **Alternative for iOS (Console App)**:
  - Connect your iOS device to your Mac, open the **Console** app, and select your device from the left sidebar. Filter logs by "Infuse" to view real-time output without needing Xcode.

### Notes
- The "Failed to open input stream in demuxing stream" error suggests an issue with the media file or network stream Infuse is trying to process. Logs might reveal if it’s a file corruption, codec incompatibility, or connection problem.
- Since Infuse is a third-party app, advanced debugging (e.g., attaching Xcode to the process) is unlikely without developer access, so the Console app (for Mac) or device logs (for iOS) are your best options.

By following these steps, you’ll be able to gather more logs to diagnose the error in Infuse, whether on Mac or iOS. If the issue persists, consider checking Infuse’s support documentation or forums for app-specific logging tips.
