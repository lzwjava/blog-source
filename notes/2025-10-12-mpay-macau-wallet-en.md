**MPay** is a mobile payment app and electronic wallet developed by Macau Pass SA, serving as Macau's first multi-functional third-party e-wallet. It supports linking multiple bank accounts and credit cards (including UnionPay cards from Macau and Hong Kong) for seamless online and offline transactions.

### Key Features:
- **Payments**: Handles in-store purchases, online shopping, bus fares, and transfers.
- **Bill Payments**: Covers utilities (water, electricity, gas), telecom bills, and ticketing.
- **Top-Up Options**: Recharge via convenience stores like 7-Eleven or linked cards.
- **International Support**: Works in nearly 60 countries/regions and integrates with over 10 overseas e-wallets for use in Macau.

It's widely used by locals and visitors for cashless convenience, especially in a city where cash is still common but digital options are growing.
