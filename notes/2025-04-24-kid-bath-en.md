A 4-year-old resisting a bath at 10pm is likely tired, overstimulated, or just asserting independence. Here’s how to handle it:

1. **Adjust Timing**: 10pm might be too late. Try bathing earlier, like 7-8pm, when she’s less cranky. Kids this age often have meltdowns when overtired.

2. **Make It Fun**: Turn bath time into playtime. Use toys, bubbles, or bath crayons. Sing songs or tell a story about a “magic bath adventure.” Distraction works wonders.

3. **Give Choices**: Let her feel in control. Ask, “Do you want to use the blue sponge or the yellow one?” or “Bubble bath or no bubbles?” Small choices reduce power struggles.

4. **Keep It Quick**: If she’s resistant, skip the full bath. A quick wipe-down with a warm washcloth for key areas (face, hands, feet) can suffice for one night.

5. **Routine Consistency**: Build a predictable nighttime routine (e.g., dinner, play, bath, story, bed). Kids thrive on routine, and she’ll come to expect the bath.

6. **Empathize and Stay Calm**: Acknowledge her feelings: “I know you don’t feel like a bath tonight, but it helps keep you clean and cozy.” Stay firm but gentle—don’t escalate into a fight.

7. **Positive Reinforcement**: Praise her when she cooperates, even slightly. “Wow, you did such a great job getting clean!” Stickers or a small reward chart can motivate.

If this is a recurring issue, check if something’s bothering her (e.g., water temperature, fear of drains). Also, ensure she’s not overtired by bedtime—4-year-olds typically need 10-11 hours of sleep and maybe a daytime nap. If resistance persists, talk to her pediatrician to rule out sensory issues.
