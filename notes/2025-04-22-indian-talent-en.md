While pinpointing every Indian or person of Indian descent with a computer-related PhD from MIT, Stanford, or an Ivy League institution would require access to extensive alumni databases, which is not feasible, I can certainly highlight some highly influential figures in computer science who fit this description or have strong connections to these universities.

It's important to note that the "Ivy League" traditionally refers to eight specific universities: Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, and Yale. While incredibly prestigious, MIT and Stanford are not part of the Ivy League. However, they are often considered on par with or even leading the Ivy League in many STEM fields, including computer science.

Here are a few examples of prominent figures, keeping in mind that this is not an exhaustive list:

* **Raj Reddy:** A Turing Award winner (often called the "Nobel Prize of Computing"), Raj Reddy received his PhD in Computer Science from **Stanford University**. While he is Indian-American, he was born and educated in India before pursuing his graduate studies in the US. His work has been foundational in artificial intelligence, particularly in speech recognition and robotics. He has spent significant time on the faculty of both Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University.

* **Anantha Chandrakasan:** He obtained his PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the **University of California, Berkeley**, which is not an Ivy League but is a top-tier institution often mentioned alongside MIT and Stanford. However, he is currently the Dean of the School of Engineering at **MIT** and a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. His research is focused on energy-efficient electronic circuits and systems.

* **Subhash Khot:** A renowned theoretical computer scientist, Subhash Khot received his PhD in Computer Science from **Princeton University**, an Ivy League institution. He is known for his work on the Unique Games Conjecture, a major open problem in computational complexity theory. He is currently a professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University.

* **Madhu Sudan:** Another prominent theoretical computer scientist, Madhu Sudan earned his PhD in Computer Science from the **University of California, Berkeley**. He has made significant contributions to coding theory and computational complexity. He has held faculty positions at **MIT** and Harvard University.

* **Umesh Vazirani:** A leading figure in quantum computing, Umesh Vazirani obtained his PhD in Computer Science from the **University of California, Berkeley**. He is currently a professor at Berkeley.

It is worth noting that many other accomplished individuals of Indian origin or descent have obtained their PhDs in computer science from these esteemed universities and have made significant contributions to various fields within computer science in academia, industry, and entrepreneurship. A broader search of alumni networks and academic publications would reveal many more such individuals.

**General Information about pursuing a Computer Science PhD at Top US Universities:**

* **Highly Competitive:** Admission to PhD programs in computer science at MIT, Stanford, and Ivy League universities is extremely competitive. These programs attract top students from around the world.
* **Rigorous Academics and Research:** These programs are known for their rigorous academic training and cutting-edge research opportunities across various areas of computer science, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, theory, systems, human-computer interaction, and more.
* **World-Class Faculty:** Students have the opportunity to work with leading researchers and faculty who are pioneers in their respective fields.
* **Strong Alumni Networks:** Graduates from these programs become part of powerful and influential alumni networks, opening doors to a wide range of career opportunities.
* **Funding Opportunities:** Most PhD programs in computer science at these institutions offer full funding, including tuition waivers and stipends for living expenses, often through research assistantships, teaching assistantships, or fellowships.
* **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** There are often opportunities for interdisciplinary research, collaborating with faculty and students from other departments and research centers.
* **Location and Industry Connections:** Being located in or near major technology hubs (like Boston for MIT and the Bay Area for Stanford) provides students with valuable opportunities for internships, collaborations with industry, and future employment.

To find more specific individuals, you could explore university websites, particularly the faculty and alumni sections of their computer science departments. Professional networking platforms like LinkedIn can also be valuable tools for searching for individuals based on their education and field of work.
