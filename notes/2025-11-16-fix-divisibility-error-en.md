title: Fix Model Configuration Divisibility Error
translated: false
type: note
---

The error is very clear:

```python
assert config.n_embd % config.n_head == 0
```

This means **n_embd must be evenly divisible by n_head** (because each attention head gets `n_embd // n_head` dimensions).

You are using this model config (probably the one I gave you earlier):

```python
n_layer = 12
n_head  = 12
n_embd  = 512
```

512 ÷ 12 = 42.666… → not an integer → crash.

### Fix: Choose n_embd that is divisible by n_head

Here are the **safe, proven combinations** that work perfectly on your 12 GB 4070 with a single FineWeb Parquet file:

#### Option 1 – Recommended (125M params, best quality/speed trade-off)
```python
n_layer = 12
n_head  = 12
n_embd  = 576        # ← 576 ÷ 12 = 48 exactly
```
→ ~125M params, still fits easily in ~10.5 GB VRAM with batch_size=16 + grad_acc=32 + block_size=1024

#### Option 2 – Slightly larger head dim (130M params)
```python
n_layer = 12
n_head  = 12
n_embd  = 720        # 720 ÷ 12 = 60
```

#### Option 3 – Very safe & common (115M params)
```python
n_layer = 12
n_head  = 12
n_embd  = 480        # 480 ÷ 12 = 40
```

#### Option 4 – If you want to keep n_embd=512 (original GPT-2 style)
```python
n_layer = 12
n_head  = 8          # 512 ÷ 8 = 64
# or
n_head  = 16         # 512 ÷ 16 = 32
```

### Quick Fix: Just change your config to this (copy-paste ready)

```python
# Model – 12 layer, ~125M params, guaranteed to work
n_layer = 12
n_head  = 12
n_embd  = 576        # ← THIS IS THE ONLY LINE YOU NEED TO CHANGE
dropout = 0.0
```

Everything else (batch_size=16, grad_acc=32, block_size=1024, etc.) stays exactly the same.

After changing to `n_embd = 576`, the assertion error disappears immediately and training will start normally.

This 12L/12H/576E model is extremely popular in the nanoGPT community right now — many people train it successfully on 12 GB 4070/4070 Ti cards using FineWeb.

Run it, it will work 100%. Let me know when you see the first loss print! 🚀
