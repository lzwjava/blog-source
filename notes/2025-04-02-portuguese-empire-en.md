The decline of the **Portuguese Empire** was a long, gradual process influenced by economic decline, military defeats, competition from other European powers, and internal instability. Here are the key reasons:  

---

### **1. Early Overextension and Small Population**  
- Portugal had a **small population and limited resources**, making it difficult to maintain a vast global empire spanning Brazil, Africa, India, and Southeast Asia.  
- The empire was **too spread out** with limited military forces, making it vulnerable to attacks from rival European powers.  

---

### **2. Competition from Other European Powers**  
- In the **16th and 17th centuries**, stronger European nations (Spain, the Netherlands, England, and France) **challenged Portugal’s dominance** in global trade.  
- The **Dutch and English** took over many of Portugal’s lucrative trading posts in Asia (e.g., Malacca, Ceylon, parts of India).  
- The **Dutch seized the Spice Trade**, cutting Portugal’s control over Indonesia.  

---

### **3. Spanish Rule (1580–1640) and Its Consequences**  
- In 1580, Portugal lost its independence and was ruled by Spain in the **Iberian Union** (1580–1640).  
- During this period, **Dutch and English forces attacked Portuguese colonies**, knowing that Spain was also at war with them.  
- After regaining independence in **1640**, Portugal struggled to rebuild its empire.  

---

### **4. Economic Decline and Dependency on Britain**  
- Portugal became economically dependent on **Britain**, especially after signing the **Methuen Treaty (1703)**, which prioritized British imports over Portuguese industry.  
- **Brazil’s gold and diamond wealth (18th century)** temporarily boosted Portugal’s economy but was largely controlled by British trade policies.  

---

### **5. Loss of Brazil (1822)**  
- Brazil was Portugal’s **richest and largest colony**. When it gained independence in **1822**, Portugal lost its main economic engine.  
- This marked the beginning of Portugal’s transformation into a minor colonial power.  

---

### **6. African Colonies and the "Scramble for Africa"**  
- Portugal still controlled Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau, but these colonies were **underdeveloped** and required heavy investment.  
- European rivals (Britain, France, Germany) **blocked Portuguese expansion** in Africa during the late 19th century.  

---

### **7. 20th-Century Decolonization and Salazar’s Dictatorship**  
- Portugal maintained its African colonies longer than other European nations, refusing to grant independence.  
- **Colonial wars (1961–1974)** in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau drained Portugal’s economy.  
- The **Carnation Revolution (1974)** overthrew the dictatorship of **António Salazar’s regime**, leading to **rapid decolonization in 1975**.  

---

### **Final Collapse (1975)**  
- After the **Carnation Revolution**, Portugal abandoned its remaining African colonies and **Macau (1999)**, marking the **end of its 500-year-old empire**.  

Portugal was one of the **first European empires to rise and the last to fall**, but ultimately, economic weakness, military struggles, and political instability led to its downfall.
