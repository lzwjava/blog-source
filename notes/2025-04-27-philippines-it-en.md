Several cities in the Philippines are recognized as key centers for IT call centers, IT companies, and technology hubs, driving the country's thriving Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and IT industries.

**Metro Manila**, the National Capital Region, remains the primary and largest hub. Within Metro Manila, **Makati, Taguig (particularly Bonifacio Global City), and Quezon City** are home to a high concentration of multinational IT companies, BPO firms, and startups, supported by a large pool of skilled IT professionals and developed infrastructure.

**Cebu City** in the Visayas is another major player, often cited as the second-largest IT-BPO hub in the country. It has a rapidly growing tech ecosystem, a strong presence of IT and call center companies, and a robust talent pool fueled by numerous universities.

In Mindanao, **Davao City** is an emerging and significant IT hub. It has seen considerable growth in its IT and BPO sectors, attracting companies and generating tech-related job opportunities. The city is increasingly recognized for its focus on innovation and digital transformation.

Other cities also gaining prominence as IT and BPO destinations include **Santa Rosa** in Laguna and **Bacolod City** in Negros Occidental, both noted for their developing infrastructure and growing number of tech and outsourcing companies.

These cities offer a combination of factors such as a large English-speaking workforce, competitive labor costs, improving infrastructure, and government support, making the Philippines a leading destination for IT and BPO operations globally.
