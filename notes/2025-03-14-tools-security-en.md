title: Powerful Tools Under Strict Security Policies
translated: false
---

For big companies that ban many AI tool websites due to security reasons, there are still several alternatives to tools like Sourcegraph and GitHub that prioritize data privacy, security, and compliance. These options can help you perform tasks like code search, AI-powered code completion, and general development while adhering to strict security policies. Below are some viable alternatives categorized by their primary use case:

---

### **1. Code Search and Intelligence (Alternatives to Sourcegraph)**
Sourcegraph is a powerful code search and intelligence tool, but if it’s banned, consider these secure options:
- **Zoekt**:  
  An open-source code search engine that’s fast and can be self-hosted. This keeps all your data within your company’s infrastructure, reducing security risks.
- **OpenGrok**:  
  Another open-source tool designed for code search and cross-referencing. It’s ideal for companies that want to deploy it internally.
- **GitLab’s Advanced Search**:  
  If your company already uses GitLab, its built-in advanced search feature provides secure code searching within your self-hosted GitLab instance.

### **2. AI-Powered Code Completion (Alternatives to GitHub Copilot)**
GitHub Copilot offers AI-driven code suggestions, but if it’s restricted, these alternatives might work:
- **Tabnine**:  
  An AI code completion tool with self-hosting options, ensuring your code and data stay on your servers.
- **IntelliCode by Microsoft**:  
  Integrated into Visual Studio and VS Code, this tool comes from a trusted vendor and may align with enterprise security standards.
- **Kite**:  
  A cloud-based AI code completion tool. While it’s useful, its cloud nature might not suit the strictest security policies, so check with your team.

---

### **3. General AI Tools for Development**
For broader AI-driven development needs, these options offer secure environments:
- **AWS CodeGuru**:  
  Provides AI-powered code reviews and performance profiling within Amazon Web Services’ secure cloud platform, which many companies already trust.
- **Google Cloud’s AI Platform**:  
  Offers a range of AI tools that operate within Google’s secure cloud infrastructure, often compliant with enterprise standards.
- **IBM Watson**:  
  Delivers enterprise-grade AI services with strong security features, suitable for integration into your applications.

### **4. Open-Source and Self-Hosted Solutions**
If your company prefers full control over tools and data, these open-source options are great:
- **Hugging Face**:  
  Provides open-source AI models you can run locally, keeping sensitive data in-house.
- **TensorFlow and PyTorch**:  
  Popular open-source machine learning frameworks that let you build custom AI tools tailored to your security needs.
- **Private GitLab or Bitbucket Instances**:  
  Self-hosted versions of these platforms can be paired with internal AI tools, offering a secure alternative to GitHub.

---

### **5. Tools with Strong Security Compliance**
These tools are designed with security in mind and may meet your company’s strict requirements:
- **SonarQube**:  
  A self-hosted tool for analyzing code quality and security, widely used in secure environments.
- **GitGuardian**:  
  Detects secrets in your code and offers self-hosted deployment options.
- **Snyk**:  
  A vulnerability scanning tool with enterprise plans that include enhanced security features.
- **DataRobot**:  
  An enterprise AI platform that can be deployed on-premise for maximum control.
- **H2O.ai**:  
  Offers both open-source and enterprise AI solutions, including on-premise deployments.

---

### **What Makes These Tools Suitable?**
Companies typically ban AI tools due to concerns about data leaks, unclear privacy policies, or external dependencies. The alternatives listed above address these issues by offering:
- **On-premise or self-hosted options**: Keeps sensitive data within your company’s infrastructure.
- **Strong data privacy policies**: Ensures clarity on how data is handled and stored.
- **Compliance with standards**: Many support certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001, which are often required by security teams.
- **Open-source flexibility**: Allows your team to audit and customize the tools for added security.

### **Final Thoughts**
The best tool for your situation depends on your company’s specific security policies. Options like Zoekt, Tabnine, or SonarQube are great if you need self-hosted solutions, while AWS CodeGuru or IBM Watson might work if your company trusts certain cloud providers with strong compliance. Collaborate with your security team to evaluate these tools based on your needs—whether it’s replacing Sourcegraph for code search, GitHub Copilot for code completion, or other AI functionalities. These alternatives ensure you can still leverage powerful tools without compromising security.
