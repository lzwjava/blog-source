title: Claude API Pricing Breakdown 2025
translated: false
type: note
---

Here’s a clearer breakdown of the API usage pricing for each of the Anthropic Claude models you listed—no tables, just straightforward, easy-to-read prose:

---

### Claude Sonnet 4

* **Input tokens:** \$3 per million
* **Output tokens:** \$15 per million
* **Discounts available:** Up to **90% off** with prompt caching, and up to **50% off** with batch processing. ([custom.typingmind.com][1], [Reddit][2], [Anthropic][3], [Anthropic][4])

---

### Claude 3.5 Sonnet (now deprecated)

* **Input tokens:** \$3 per million
* **Output tokens:** \$15 per million
* **Batch and cache rates:** Same tiered system as other Sonnet iterations: \$1.50 for batch input, \$7.50 for batch output, and \$0.30 for 5‑minute cache hits. ([Anthropic Docs][5])

---

### Claude 3.7 Sonnet

* **Base pricing:** Exactly the same as 3.5—\$3 per million input, \$15 per million output—including when using the hybrid “thinking” mode. ([Reddit][6], [Anthropic Docs][5])

---

### Claude Opus 4

* **Input tokens:** \$15 per million
* **Output tokens:** \$75 per million
* **Batch and cache discounts:** Batch input is \$7.50; batch output is \$37.50; cache hits cost \$1.50. ([Anthropic][7], [Amazon Web Services, Inc.][8], [Anthropic Docs][5], [Wikipedia][9])

---

### Quick Summary

* **All Sonnet variants (3.5, 3.7, 4):** \$3 per million input / \$15 per million output, with deeper discounts for batch and caching.
* **Opus 4:** Substantially higher rates, at \$15 / \$75 per million, but optimized for deep reasoning, long tasks, and higher performance.

---

### Additional Insights

* **Model evolution:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet set new benchmarks in coding ability when it launched in June 2024, but the pricing remained unchanged with 3.7 in February 2025 and again with Sonnet 4 in May 2025, despite performance improvements. ([Business Insider][10], [Anthropic][7], [Anthropic Docs][5], [Wikipedia][11])
* **Use case alignment:** If your workload is chat-focused or high-volume, Sonnet models offer outstanding value-per-performance. For deeply complex tasks or prolonged agentic workflows, Opus or a hybrid strategy that mixes both may be more efficient.
