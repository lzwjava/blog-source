### **Overview of India**

- **Geography**:  
  India spans approximately 3.29 million square kilometers, making it the seventh-largest country by land area. It is bordered by Pakistan to the northwest, China and Nepal to the north, Bhutan to the northeast, Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east, and the Indian Ocean to the south, with coastlines along the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Its diverse topography includes the Himalayan mountain range, the Indo-Gangetic plains, the Thar Desert, and lush coastal regions. Major rivers like the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus are lifelines for agriculture and culture.

- **History**:  
  India’s history stretches over 5,000 years, from the ancient Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300–1300 BCE) to Vedic kingdoms, Mauryan and Gupta empires, and medieval dynasties like the Mughals and Marathas. It was a major center of trade and culture before British colonization (1757–1947). India gained independence on August 15, 1947, led by figures like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Since then, it has evolved into a global power while preserving its historical legacy.

- **Culture**:  
  India is a mosaic of languages, religions, and traditions. It is home to Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, and other faiths. With 22 official languages (including Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, and English) and over 1,600 dialects, linguistic diversity is a hallmark. Festivals like Diwali, Eid, Holi, and Christmas are celebrated nationwide. Indian cuisine, music, dance (e.g., Bharatanatyam, Kathak), and literature (e.g., epics like the Mahabharata and Ramayana) are globally influential.

- **Economy**:  
  India is the world’s fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP (approximately $3.9 trillion in 2025) and a leader in IT, pharmaceuticals, and services. Agriculture remains vital, employing nearly 40% of the workforce. Cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Mumbai drive innovation, while traditional industries like textiles and handicrafts thrive in places like Surat and Jaipur. India’s startup ecosystem is among the largest globally, with unicorns in fintech, e-commerce, and health tech.

- **Politics**:  
  India is a federal parliamentary democracy with a president as head of state and a prime minister as head of government. It has a multi-party system, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Indian National Congress (INC) as major players. The country is divided into 28 states and 8 union territories, each with significant autonomy. New Delhi is the political capital, hosting Parliament and key institutions.
