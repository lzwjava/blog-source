### Notes
- Selection focuses on software engineers and computer scientists under 30 (or successful by 30) with significant contributions in AI, systems programming, or software tools, based on sources like Forbes’ 30 Under 30 (2022–2024) and tech blogs.
- Ages are estimated where exact birth years are unavailable, using achievement timelines (e.g., Forbes listings or project milestones).
- Unlike the previous response, this list excludes non-software fields (e.g., biomedical, aerospace) and emphasizes coding, AI, and software systems.
- I critically evaluated sources, ensuring claims (e.g., Quazi’s SpaceX role, Sodha’s PhD) are corroborated by reputable outlets, avoiding unverified X posts.
- If you’d like a deeper dive into their projects (e.g., Valdarrama’s PyTorch contributions, Zhou’s code review algorithms), a comparison chart (e.g., programming languages used, project scale), or more candidates, let me know! I can also search X or the web for additional examples or analyze their GitHub repositories.

Would you like me to generate a visual chart comparing their software domains (e.g., AI vs. systems) or explore specific technical details (e.g., open-source contributions, algorithms)?
