### Tsung-Dao Lee: Overview

Tsung-Dao Lee (Chinese: 李政道; November 24, 1926 – August 4, 2024) was a renowned Chinese-American theoretical physicist, celebrated for his groundbreaking work in particle physics and contributions to quantum field theory.

#### Early Life and Education
Born in Shanghai, China, to a family with a background in chemistry and education, Lee's studies were disrupted by the Second Sino-Japanese War. He began his higher education in chemical engineering at National Chekiang University (now Zhejiang University) in 1943 but switched to physics after impressing professors like Shu Xingbei and Wang Ganchang. He later studied at National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming. In 1946, he earned a fellowship to the U.S., where he joined the University of Chicago under Enrico Fermi, completing his PhD in 1950 on white dwarf stars. He briefly worked at UC Berkeley before joining Columbia University in 1953.

#### Major Contributions
Lee's work revolutionized particle physics. With Chen Ning Yang, he proposed the violation of parity conservation in weak interactions in 1956, a theory experimentally verified by Chien-Shiung Wu's 1957 experiment. This resolved puzzles in K-meson decays and earned them the Nobel Prize. Other key achievements include:
- The Lee–Yang theorem on phase transitions.
- Pioneering high-energy neutrino physics in the 1960s.
- The KLN theorem (1964) on particle divergences.
- Advances in relativistic heavy ion physics and non-topological solitons (1970s–1980s), influencing models of soliton stars and black holes.
- Leadership in lattice QCD and supercomputing at RIKEN-BNL (1997–2003), including the development of teraflops-scale machines.
His research spanned statistical mechanics, astrophysics, and quantum chromodynamics.

#### Awards and Honors
At age 30, Lee shared the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics with Yang—the first for a Chinese-born scientist and the youngest in physics post-WWII. Other accolades include the Albert Einstein Award (1957), Hughes Medal (1980), Galileo Galilei Medal (1980), and Marcel Grossmann Prize (2015). He was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (1964) and Academia Sinica (1975).

#### Later Life and Legacy
Lee taught at Columbia until retiring in 2012 as University Professor Emeritus. He naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1962 and played a key role in U.S.-China scientific exchange via the CUSPEA program. Married to Jeannette Hui-Chun Chin (d. 1996) since 1950, he had two sons. In 1998, he founded scholarships in her memory at top Chinese universities. Lee passed away in San Francisco at 97, leaving a profound impact on global physics.
