title: Two Creams for Bee Sting Relief
translated: false
---

When dealing with a bee sting, two different creams can be helpful, each with a distinct purpose:

---

## Fucidin Cream (夫西地酸乳膏)

**What it's for:** This cream is used to **prevent or treat skin infections** that might develop after a bee sting. When a bee stings you, it creates a small break in your skin, which can allow bacteria to enter and cause an infection. Fucidin Cream works against common bacteria like *Staphylococcus* and *Streptococcus*, which are often responsible for skin inflammations.

**In simpler terms:** It's an **antibiotic cream** that fights off bacterial infections.

**Important to know:** You might feel a **slight stinging or irritation** where you apply the cream.

## Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (丁酸氢化可的松乳膏)

**What it's for:** This cream helps to **reduce the local allergic reaction** to a bee sting. A bee's venom can trigger an immune response in your body, leading to uncomfortable symptoms like **redness and itching**. Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream helps to calm this inflammatory reaction.

**In simpler terms:** It's a **corticosteroid cream** that reduces inflammation and allergic symptoms.

**Important to know:**
* You **shouldn't use it for a long time or over large areas** of your skin.
* Be careful to **avoid getting it in your eyes or on other mucous membranes** (like inside your nose or mouth).

These two creams offer different approaches to managing bee stings – one for infection and one for allergic reactions. Always follow the instructions provided with your medication.
