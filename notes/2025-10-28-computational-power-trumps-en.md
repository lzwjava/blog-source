### The Bitter Lesson by Richard Sutton

Richard Sutton, a pioneering AI researcher known for his work in reinforcement learning, wrote a short essay in 2019 titled "The Bitter Lesson." It's a reflection on over 70 years of AI history, arguing that the most effective paths to AI progress aren't the ones that mimic human intelligence or pack in specialized knowledge. Instead, the "bitter" truth is that **general-purpose methods that scale with raw computational power—things like search algorithms and machine learning—consistently outperform clever, human-inspired designs over the long term**.

#### Core Idea
Sutton observes a recurring pattern: Early AI successes often come from injecting human expertise (e.g., rules, heuristics, or domain-specific knowledge) into systems. This feels intuitive and efficient at first, but as computation gets cheaper and more abundant, those knowledge-heavy approaches hit walls. They become brittle, hard to scale, and outpaced by simpler "meta-methods" that let computers brute-force solutions through trial and error.

The "bitter" part? We humans hate this lesson because it sidelines our ingenuity and intuition. We'd rather build systems that "think like us," but the evidence shows that's a dead end for big advances. Sutton sums it up: "The bitter lesson is based on the observation that the most powerful methods we have developed... are those that leverage computation."

#### Historical Examples
Sutton draws from AI milestones to illustrate:
- **Chess**: In the 1990s, human experts dominated with knowledge-based programs encoding openings, tactics, and strategy. But Deep Blue (1997) crushed Kasparov using massive search trees and computation, ignoring much of that "wisdom."
- **Go**: Similar story—AlphaGo (2016) learned through self-play and neural networks, not by studying pro games deeply. It scaled with compute, beating intuition-based rivals.
- **Speech Recognition**: Hand-crafted linguistic models ruled until statistical learning (leveraging data and compute) took over in the 2010s, leading to today's voice assistants.
- **Computer Vision**: Early systems relied on edge detection and shape rules; now, deep learning devours pixels with GPUs.

In each case, the knowledge approach won short-term battles but lost the war to compute-hungry generality.

#### Why It Matters
This lesson pushes AI toward "scalable oversight"—building systems that learn from vast data without needing us to spoon-feed every insight. It's why today's breakthroughs (like large language models) come from training on internet-scale data rather than rulebooks. But it's "bitter" because it implies we'll need even more compute (and energy) to keep advancing, and it de-emphasizes crafting "elegant" solutions.

Sutton wrote this as a warning: Don't fight the trend; embrace it for faster progress.
