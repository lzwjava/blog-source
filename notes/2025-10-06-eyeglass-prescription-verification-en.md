### Verification of Your Details

I'll break this down point by point based on standard optometry knowledge, ergonomic guidelines, and market pricing trends for China (focusing on platforms like Pinduoduo, Alibaba, and AliExpress for comparable data). Overall, your description is mostly reasonable and aligns with common practices for self-testing myopia and astigmatism corrections. There are a couple of minor caveats on pricing and lens notation, but nothing that makes it implausible.

#### 1. **Desktop computer is usually farther from our eyes than a laptop**
   - **Reasonable?** Yes, this is accurate.
   - **Explanation:** Typical laptop screen distance is 13–20 inches (33–50 cm) due to the device's portability and arm's-length positioning. Desktop monitors are recommended at 20–40 inches (50–100 cm) for reduced eye strain, placing them farther away. This difference can affect focus for myopic users, as desktops require more accommodation or adjusted prescriptions.

#### 2. **To see the desktop screen barely clearly, we often need customized eyeglasses**
   - **Reasonable?** Yes, especially for moderate myopia.
   - **Explanation:** Standard single-vision glasses optimized for distance (e.g., reading or general use) may not provide sharp intermediate vision at desktop distances (around 24–32 inches). Customized options like computer glasses (with reduced minus power) or progressives are common to minimize blur and strain. This is a frequent recommendation from optometric associations.

#### 3. **Trial lenses: -3.75 / -1.75 as base myopia correction, -0.25 / -0.25 and -0.50 / -0.50 as incremental/decremental, -1.00 / -1.00 for astigmatism**
   - **Reasonable?** Yes, these values are standard and plausible.
   - **Explanation:** 
     - **Base:** -3.75 diopters (D) sphere is moderate myopia (corrects nearsightedness up to about 20/40–20/50 uncorrected). -1.75 D cylinder is mild-moderate astigmatism. The "/" notation typically means sphere/cylinder, which fits.
     - **Increments:** ±0.25 D and ±0.50 D are the smallest standard steps for fine-tuning refraction—optometrists use these to dial in the sharpest vision without over-correction.
     - **Astigmatism:** -1.00 D cylinder is a common correction for irregular corneal curvature.
     - All are within typical ranges (-20 D max for severe myopia, -4 D common for astigmatism).

#### 4. **Trial frame has three slots; common use: base myopia in one, incremental/decremental in another, astigmatism in third (can't combine -0.25 and -0.50 due to slot limit)**
   - **Reasonable?** Yes, this matches standard trial frame design and usage.
   - **Explanation:** Most universal trial frames (e.g., UB-4 or similar models) have 3–4 slots per eye (front and sometimes rear) to stack lenses additively. Your method—base sphere + increment/decrement + cylinder (astigmatism)—is a basic refraction technique. With only three slots, you'd indeed reserve one for the cylinder lens, preventing stacking two increments (e.g., -0.25 + -0.50). This is simpler than a phoropter and great for home trials, though professional refraction often uses more slots.

#### 5. **Trial glasses cost around 48 CNY, trial lenses about 28 CNY on Pinduoduo in China**
   - **Reasonable?** Plausible for basic/low-end versions, but on the lower side—likely for minimal kits or individual pieces.
   - **Explanation:** 
     - **Trial glasses (frame):** Basic adjustable plastic/metal trial frames start at 40–100 CNY on Chinese platforms like Pinduoduo or AliExpress (e.g., lightweight models with PD adjustment 48–80 mm). 48 CNY fits "bargain" listings for non-professional use.
     - **Trial lenses:** Full sets (266+ pieces) run 500–800 CNY, but individual lenses or small packs (e.g., 4–10 pieces in your range) are 10–30 CNY each on discount sites. 28 CNY could cover a handful of your specified powers (-0.25, -0.50, -1.00 cylinders). Pinduoduo is known for flash sales undercutting Alibaba prices, so this tracks for hobbyist/self-testing gear.

#### 6. **Regret not buying/learning earlier; could avoid 5 store visits in 3 years and have more comfortable glasses**
   - **Reasonable?** Absolutely—personal but practical.
   - **Explanation:** Home trial kits empower self-adjustments, reducing trips for minor tweaks (common with progressive myopia). Many users report better daily comfort from iterative testing, avoiding over-reliance on static prescriptions.

### Summary
Your setup is sensible for DIY optometry tweaks, especially for computer use. The optical facts and frame mechanics check out perfectly, and prices align with cheap Chinese e-commerce options (though verify current listings, as they fluctuate). If you're buying, ensure the lenses are glass/quality CR-39 for accuracy—plastic can warp. Great idea to experiment; it could indeed save time and hassle!
