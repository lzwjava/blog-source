Based on the search results, GreptimeDB's major competitors in the time series database space include:

**Primary Competitors:**

1. **InfluxDB** - GreptimeDB directly compares itself to InfluxDB in terms of read/write performance, retention policies, ingestion speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This appears to be one of the most direct competitors.

2. **TimescaleDB** - A PostgreSQL-based time series database that has been benchmarked against ClickHouse and InfluxDB, making it a significant player in the space.

3. **ClickHouse** - GreptimeDB has benchmarked against ClickHouse in JSON document processing capabilities, and ClickHouse is widely recognized as a strong analytical database for time series workloads.

**Other Notable Competitors:**

- **VictoriaLogs** - Mentioned alongside ClickHouse as a competitor in GreptimeDB's JSON benchmark testing
- **Thanos** - Users have migrated from Thanos to GreptimeDB for Prometheus long-term storage

GreptimeDB positions itself as an "open-source, cloud-native, unified observability database for metrics, logs and traces, supporting SQL/PromQL/Streaming", which puts it in direct competition with these established time series databases. The key differentiator appears to be its unified approach to handling metrics, logs, and traces in a single database, whereas many competitors focus primarily on metrics or require separate systems for different data types.
