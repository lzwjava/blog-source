title: Understanding npm --legacy-peer-deps flag
translated: false
---

### Overview
The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is an option used with npm (Node Package Manager) to control how peer dependencies are handled during package installation. Peers deps are dependencies that one package expects another to provide, but they're not installed automatically in newer npm versions.

### Behavior
- **Standard npm (v7+)**: By default, it strictly enforces peer dependency requirements. If a package declares a peer dep that isn't met, npm warns or fails the install to prevent conflicts.
- **With --legacy-peer-deps**: It falls back to the older behavior (from npm v3~v6), where missing peer deps are automatically installed, even if it leads to duplicates or mismatches. This can resolve some legacy package issues but may cause enbugs.

### Example Usage
In a terminal, you'd run:
```
npm install some-package --legacy-peer-deps
```
This is often used for projects relying on older libraries that haven't updated their peer dep declarations, as seen in many React or Angular setups before npm's strict peer handling.

### When to Use
Use it sparingly, as it bypasses safeguards and could lead to dependency hell. Prefer updating packages or using `--force`/`--save-dev` for better alternatives. For full details, check the official npm docs on peer dependencies.
