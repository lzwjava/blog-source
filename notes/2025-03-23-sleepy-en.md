It sounds like you're experiencing a common issue – feeling sleepy when you're trying to focus on reading, especially in a comfortable position. Let's break down your questions and explore some strategies to help you stay awake.

**Is your current strategy okay?**

Taking breaks to drink or rest your body is generally a good idea to combat fatigue. It's important to step away from the screen and change your environment. However, if you're consistently falling asleep, it might not be fully addressing the root cause.

**Is it better to take a snap?**

Short naps (around 20-30 minutes) can sometimes be refreshing and improve alertness. However, longer naps, like the ones you described (even after 9 hours of sleep), can sometimes lead to grogginess (sleep inertia) and make it harder to stay awake later. If you find yourself wanting to sleep for hours even after a full night's rest, it might be worth considering other factors (more on that below).

**How to better keep your mind awake?**

Here are some strategies you can try to stay awake and focused when reading:

**1. Optimize Your Environment:**

* **Lighting:** Ensure you have bright, natural light or a strong artificial light source. A dimly lit environment can promote drowsiness.
* **Temperature:** Keep the room slightly cool. A warm, cozy environment can make you feel sleepy.
* **Noise:** Find a balance. Some people focus better with a bit of white noise, while others need complete silence. Experiment to see what works for you.
* **Fresh Air:** Make sure the room is well-ventilated. Open a window or use a fan to circulate fresh air.

**2. Adjust Your Reading Posture and Setup:**

* **Avoid Reclining Too Much:** While a backrest pillow is comfortable, being too reclined can make you feel relaxed and sleepy. Try sitting more upright.
* **Laptop Position:** Ensure your laptop screen is at eye level to avoid neck strain and promote a more alert posture. You might need a laptop stand.
* **Take Breaks to Move:** Instead of just resting, incorporate some light movement during your breaks. Stand up, stretch, walk around for a few minutes. This can increase blood flow and energy levels.

**3. Implement Active Reading Techniques:**

* **Engage Actively:** Don't just passively read. Highlight key points, take notes, ask yourself questions about the material. This keeps your mind more engaged.
* **Break Down Reading into Smaller Chunks:** Instead of trying to read for long stretches, break it down into smaller, manageable sessions with short breaks in between.
* **Read Aloud (Occasionally):** Reading aloud can help you focus and stay engaged with the material.

**4. Manage Your Sleep Habits:**

* **Establish a Regular Sleep Schedule:** Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.
* **Ensure Sufficient Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Feeling consistently tired can make you fall asleep easily during the day.
* **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:** Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool to promote restful sleep.
* **Avoid Caffeine and Alcohol Before Bed:** These substances can interfere with your sleep.

**5. Consider Your Diet and Hydration:**

* **Stay Hydrated:** Dehydration can lead to fatigue. Drink water regularly throughout the day.
* **Eat Balanced Meals:** Avoid heavy, sugary meals that can cause energy crashes. Opt for balanced meals with protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.

**6. Timing and Routine:**

* **Schedule Reading for Alert Times:** If you know you tend to feel sleepy after meals, try to schedule your reading sessions for times when you naturally feel more alert.
* **Create a Pre-Reading Routine:** Establish a short routine before you start reading to signal to your brain that it's time to focus. This could involve getting a glass of water, stretching, or taking a few deep breaths.

**7. Rule Out Underlying Issues:**

* **Consider Your Overall Stress Levels:** High stress can sometimes manifest as fatigue. Practice stress-management techniques.
* **Think About Potential Medical Conditions:** If you consistently feel excessively tired despite getting enough sleep, it's worth consulting a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions like sleep disorders, anemia, or thyroid issues.

**In summary:**

Your current strategy of taking breaks is good, but you might need to incorporate more active strategies to stay awake. Short naps can be helpful for some, but be mindful of their duration. Focus on optimizing your environment, posture, reading techniques, and overall sleep habits to better maintain alertness. If the problem persists, consider seeking professional medical advice.
