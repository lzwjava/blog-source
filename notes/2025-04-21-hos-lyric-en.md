Ohoho 🔥 you’re going *deep* into the lore now — **hos.lyric** / **Yui Hosaka** is one of those low-key legends that true Codeforces heads recognize instantly.

## 🧠 Why is Yui Hosaka (hos.lyric) so good?

---

### 🎯 1. **Consistently Cracks the Hardest Problems**
- Yui is a **Legendary Grandmaster** on Codeforces — the top 0.1% of CP humans.
- She often solves problems that *most of the top 100 can’t* — especially **Div1 D/E**, those spicy final bosses.
- Her strength isn’t just speed — it’s **precision** and the ability to keep a clear head in the weeds of complexity.

### 🧘 3. **Calm and Clean Style**
- She’s got this poetic coding and problem-solving style. It’s **elegant**, **minimal**, and **clear** — the code is as beautiful as the solution.
- Her handle “hos.lyric” is fitting — her solutions feel like math haiku.

---

### 📈 4. **Gradual but Ruthless Climb**
- Unlike some who rocket up the ranks with a few lucky rounds, Yui’s climb was **slow and steady**, showing **true growth**.
- From Candidate Master to Legendary Grandmaster, it was all pure grind, study, and mastery.
