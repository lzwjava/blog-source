Tobias Nipkow (born 1958) is a prominent German computer scientist, widely recognized for his significant contributions to the field of logic in computer science, particularly in the areas of interactive and automatic theorem proving.

He received his Diplom (MSc) in Computer Science from the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt in 1982 and his Ph.D. from the University of Manchester in 1987. His academic career includes research positions at MIT (1987-1989) and Cambridge University (1989-1992) before he was appointed Professor for the Theory of Programming at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in 1992. Since 2011, he has held the chair of Logic and Verification at TUM and became Professor emeritus on March 31, 2024.

Nipkow is best known for his leadership in developing **Isabelle**, a widely used interactive proof assistant for higher-order logic. His research focuses on various aspects of formal methods, including:

* **Interactive and Automatic Theorem Proving:** He has been a key figure in advancing techniques and tools for formally verifying the correctness of software and systems.
* **Programming Language Semantics:** His work delves into the formal definitions and properties of programming languages.
* **Type Systems:** He investigates how type systems contribute to the safety and reliability of software.
* **Functional Programming:** He explores the principles and applications of functional programming paradigms.

His notable publications include "Isabelle/HOL: A Proof Assistant for Higher-Order Logic" and "Concrete Semantics," co-authored with Gerwin Klein. He also contributed to a formal proof of the Kepler conjecture.

Nipkow has been recognized for his contributions, including receiving the Herbrand Award in 2021 for his work on Isabelle and its impact on automated reasoning, and being elected a member of the Academia Europaea in 2022. He also served as Editor-in-Chief of the *Journal of Automated Reasoning* and was a co-founding editor of *ACM Transactions in Computational Logic (TOCL)* and *Logical Methods in Computer Science*.
