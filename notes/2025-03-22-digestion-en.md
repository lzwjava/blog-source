After you eat, your body kicks into digestion mode, a process that uses energy and generates heat. This is known as postprandial thermogenesis. In simpler terms, when you digest food, your metabolism ramps up to break it down, which can raise your body temperature. Additionally, if your meal is spicy or particularly rich, it can trigger what’s sometimes called "gustatory sweating," where the heat and capsaicin (from spicy foods) stimulate nerve responses that cause sweating. 

In many cases, these reactions are normal. However, if you find that the heat or sweating is excessive or accompanied by other symptoms (like rapid heartbeat, discomfort, or anxiety), it might be a good idea to consult a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying issues such as thyroid problems or food sensitivities.

Let me know if you need more details or further clarification on any of these points!
