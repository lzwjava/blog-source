You’re referring to **“氨纶” (ān lún)** in Chinese — sometimes people also pronounce or write it informally as “安纶”.

**氨纶 (Spandex / Elastane / Lycra)** is a **synthetic elastic fiber** known for its exceptional stretchability.

Here’s a plain explanation:

* **Chinese name:** 氨纶
* **Pinyin:** ān lún
* **English names:** Spandex, Elastane, or Lycra (brand name)
* **Composition:** Made from polyurethane (a kind of polymer).
* **Features:**

  * Can stretch up to 5–8 times its original length and return to shape
  * Soft, smooth, and resistant to sweat
  * Usually blended with cotton, polyester, or nylon to make fabrics elastic

**Common uses:**
Sportswear, leggings, yoga pants, swimsuits, underwear, and fitted T-shirts.

You also mentioned **“涤纶” (dí lún)** — that’s **polyester**. It’s a different fiber: less stretchy, more durable, and wrinkle-resistant.

So:

* **氨纶 = Spandex / Elastane (stretchy)**
* **涤纶 = Polyester (smooth, durable, not stretchy)**
