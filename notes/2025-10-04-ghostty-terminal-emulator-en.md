Ghostty is a modern terminal emulator designed to deliver exceptional performance, a wealth of features, and seamless integration with native desktop environments. Unlike many terminals that prioritize either speed or features at the expense of the other, Ghostty aims to excel in all areas: it's blazingly fast, packed with advanced capabilities, and feels like a first-class citizen on your operating system. Built with GPU acceleration and platform-native UI components, it redefines what a terminal can be for developers, system administrators, and power users who spend hours in the command line.

## History and Development

Ghostty began as a personal side project in 2021, spearheaded by Mitchell Hashimoto—the creator of tools like Vagrant and Terraform at HashiCorp. What started as a hobby to explore building a high-performance terminal evolved into a collaborative effort, with contributions from the open-source community. Development occurred in Hashimoto's spare time, emphasizing engineering excellence over commercial pressures. Key early decisions included using the Zig programming language for its safety and efficiency, GPU rendering for speed (Metal on macOS, OpenGL on Linux), and a modular architecture to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

The project remained under wraps until its public release on December 26, 2024, which generated significant buzz in the developer community. By early 2025, it had matured into version 1.0, positioning itself as a drop-in replacement for popular terminals like iTerm2, Alacritty, or Kitty. As of October 2025, Ghostty continues to iterate, with ongoing work to stabilize its core library for broader embedding in other applications. Future plans include Windows support and releasing `libghostty` as a standalone, C-compatible library for third-party integrations.

## Key Goals and Philosophy

At its core, Ghostty's philosophy is to push the boundaries of terminal emulators by balancing three pillars: **speed**, **feature richness**, and **native feel**. Many terminals sacrifice one for the others—Alacritty is fast but minimalistic, while iTerm2 is feature-heavy but heavier on resources. Ghostty rejects this trade-off, aiming to feel as responsive as the quickest options while offering deep customization and platform-specific polish.

It's a "passion project" that prioritizes user delight: intuitive controls, automatic adaptations to system themes, and tools that enhance productivity without overwhelming configuration. Compatibility is key—Ghostty adheres to xterm standards for legacy apps while embracing modern protocols like Kitty's for cutting-edge ones. The result is a terminal that's not just a tool, but an extension of your workflow.

## Supported Platforms

Ghostty is cross-platform, with native implementations for:
- **macOS**: Built using Swift, AppKit, and SwiftUI for a deeply integrated experience.
- **Linux**: Implemented in Zig with GTK4 for compatibility across desktop environments like GNOME and KDE.

Windows support is in the roadmap, leveraging the same core library. This native approach ensures it blends into your OS without jarring custom widgets or inconsistent behaviors.

## Architecture

Ghostty's secret sauce is its modular design, centered around `libghostty`—a cross-platform library handling terminal emulation, font rendering, and GPU-accelerated drawing. This core is shared between platforms:
- On macOS, the GUI wraps it in native Swift components.
- On Linux, Zig code interfaces with GTK4.

This separation allows for potential ecosystem growth, where other apps could embed Ghostty's terminal engine. Rendering uses shaders for efficiency, and the event loop (via Libxev) keeps input latency minimal.

## Features

Ghostty's features are divided into **terminal features** (end-user enhancements) and **application features** (tools for developers building CLI apps). It ships with hundreds of themes, extensive keybindings, and a configuration file that's simple yet powerful (in TOML format).

### Terminal Features (For End-Users)
- **Multi-Window, Tabs, and Splits**: Native UI for managing sessions—drag to rearrange, with platform-standard shortcuts (e.g., Cmd+T for new tabs on macOS).
- **GPU-Accelerated Rendering**: Smooth scrolling and animations via Metal/OpenGL, making even large outputs feel instant.
- **Themes and Appearance**: Auto-switch based on system dark/light mode; custom themes with ligatures, font features (e.g., auto-italicize), and grapheme clustering for proper emoji and RTL script handling (Arabic/Hebrew, left-to-right only).
- **Input and Security**: Secure Keyboard Entry (auto-detects password prompts with a lock icon); platform shortcuts like three-finger taps for Quick Look on macOS.
- **Quick Terminal (macOS Exclusive)**: A drop-down mini-terminal from the menu bar for quick commands without leaving your app.
- **Proxy Icon and File Handling**: Drag title-bar icons to navigate or move session files.
- **Hyperlinks and Inspector**: Clickable links; an interactive Terminal Inspector for debugging escape sequences.

### Application Features (For Developers)
- **Kitty Protocols**: Full support for graphics (render images in-terminal) and keyboard enhancements.
- **Synchronized Rendering**: Coordinates updates for smoother app performance.
- **Light/Dark Mode Notifications**: Apps like Neovim or Zellij can react to theme changes.
- **Broad Compatibility**: xterm-256 colors, true color, mouse reporting, and modern escape sequences—ensuring legacy tools work while enabling innovations.

## Performance

Ghostty claims top-tier speed, with noticeable gains in scroll responsiveness and launch times compared to peers. Its GPU focus shines in high-throughput scenarios like logs or diffs, though formal benchmarks are forthcoming. In everyday use, users report it feeling "snappier" than iTerm2 and on par with Alacritty, without sacrificing features.

## Getting Started

Download from the official site for macOS (.dmg) or Linux (.deb/.rpm/AppImage). No installation wizard—just extract and run. Configure via `~/.config/ghostty/config.toml` for themes, fonts, and bindings. It's free and open-source under the MIT license.

Ghostty isn't just another terminal; it's a glimpse at what the command line could be—fast, beautiful, and effortlessly native. If you're tired of compromises, give it a spin.
