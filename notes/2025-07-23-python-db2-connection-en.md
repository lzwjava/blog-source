### Overview
IBM DB2 is a relational database management system, and Python can interact with it using the `ibm_db` package, which provides a low-level interface, and `ibm_db_dbi`, a DB-API 2.0 compliant wrapper that sits on top of `ibm_db` for easier, more Pythonic usage. `ibm_db` is more direct and powerful but requires deeper knowledge, while `ibm_db_dbi` mimics Python's `sqlite3` module, making it simpler for standard database operations. Both are part of the IBM DB2 Python drivers.

### Installation
Install the packages using pip:
```
pip install ibm_db
pip install ibm_db_dbi
```
Note: These require a DB2 client library. For Windows/Linux, download and install IBM Data Server Driver Package from IBM's site. On macOS, it might need additional setup. Ensure your DB2 server is accessible (e.g., running on a host with credentials).

### Using ibm_db
`ibm_db` provides functions for connecting, executing statements, and handling results. It's non-compliant with DB-API but offers more control.

#### Basic Connection and Query
```python
import ibm_db

# Connection string format: DATABASE=<db_name>;HOSTNAME=<host>;PORT=<port>;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=<user>;PWD=<password>;
conn_str = "DATABASE=mydb;HOSTNAME=192.168.1.100;PORT=50000;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=myuser;PWD=mypassword;"

# Connect
conn = ibm_db.connect(conn_str, "", "")

# Execute a query
stmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, "SELECT * FROM MYTABLE")

# Fetch results (one at a time)
row = ibm_db.fetch_assoc(stmt)
while row:
    print(row)  # Returns a dict
    row = ibm_db.fetch_assoc(stmt)

# Close
ibm_db.close(conn)
```
- **Key Functions**: `connect()`, `exec_immediate()` for simple queries, `prepare()` and `execute()` for parameterized queries to prevent injection.
- **Prepared Statements**: Use `prepare()` to compile a query and `execute()` with parameters.

#### Error Handling
```python
try:
    conn = ibm_db.connect(conn_str, "", "")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Connection failed: {str(e)}")
```

### Using ibm_db_dbi
`ibm_db_dbi` implements DB-API 2.0, making it interchangeable with modules like `sqlite3` or `psycopg2`.

#### Basic Connection and Query
```python
import ibm_db_dbi

# Connection string similar to ibm_db
conn_str = "DATABASE=mydb;HOSTNAME=192.168.1.100;PORT=50000;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=myuser;PWD=mypassword;"

# Connect
conn = ibm_db_dbi.connect(conn_str)

# Create cursor
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM MYTABLE")

# Fetch results
rows = cursor.fetchall()  # Returns list of tuples
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Close
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```
- **Parameterized Queries**: `cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM MYTABLE WHERE ID = ?", (id_value,))` – uses ? placeholders.
- **Transactions**: `conn.commit()` or `conn.rollback()`; autocommit is off by default.

### Key Differences and When to Use Which
| Feature              | ibm_db                          | ibm_db_dbi                      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Compliance           | Non-DB-API (low-level)          | DB-API 2.0 compliant           |
| Ease of Use          | Requires more code; direct access | Simpler, Python-like syntax    |
| Performance         | Potentially faster for complex ops| Overhead from wrapper          |
| Functionality       | Full DB2 features               | Subset via DB-API interface    |
| Use Case            | Custom apps needing raw control  | Standard CRUD operations       |

Use `ibm_db_dbi` for familiarity if you're used to other DB-API drivers. Switch to `ibm_db` for advanced DB2-specific features like stored procedures or bulk operations.

### Best Practices
- Always handle exceptions and close connections in a `try-finally` or `with` block to avoid resource leaks.
- For large result sets, use `fetchmany(size)` instead of `fetchall()` to limit memory usage.
- Check DB2 version compatibility; the packages support DB2 LUW, z/OS, iSeries.
- Refer to IBM's documentation for advanced topics like SSL connections or CLPPlus integration.
