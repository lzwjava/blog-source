title: Log Levels of NPM
translated: false
---

NPM (Node Package Manager) provides several log levels that control the verbosity of output when running npm commands. Here they are, from least to most verbose:

- **silent**: Shows no output
- **error**: Only shows errors (default)
- **warn**: Shows errors and warnings
- **notice**: Shows errors, warnings, and notices
- **http**: Shows HTTP requests
- **timing**: Shows timing information
- **info**: Shows information messages
- **verbose**: Shows detailed information
- **silly**: Shows all debug information

You can set the log level using the `--loglevel` flag or the `npm_config_loglevel` environment variable:

```bash
npm install --loglevel verbose
```

Or you can set it in your npm configuration:

```bash
npm config set loglevel verbose
```

The default log level is "error" for most commands, meaning you'll only see error messages unless you specifically request more verbose output.
