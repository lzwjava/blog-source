Qian Mu, also known as Ch'ien Mu, stands as one of the most influential Chinese historians, philosophers, and writers of the 20th century. Born in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, he is recognized alongside Lü Simian, Chen Yinke, and Chen Yuan as one of the "Four Greatest Historians of Modern China." Qian Mu's prolific scholarship, deep engagement with traditional Chinese thought, and efforts to preserve and revitalize Chinese culture in a period of immense change left an indelible mark on modern Chinese intellectual history.

Despite lacking extensive formal higher education, Qian Mu rose to prominence through rigorous self-study and profound insights. He began his teaching career in primary schools and, remarkably, joined the faculty of prestigious institutions like Yenching University, Tsinghua University, and Peking University in the 1930s based on the strength of his scholarship.

Qian Mu's academic contributions spanned a wide range of areas, including Chinese history, intellectual history, and the study of Chinese classics and Confucianism. Unlike many of his contemporaries who were deeply influenced by the iconoclastic spirit of the New Culture Movement and its skepticism towards tradition, Qian Mu championed the enduring value and relevance of traditional Chinese culture. He dedicated his life to interpreting and promoting this heritage, believing it held the key to China's future.

His magnum opus, *A General Outline of Chinese History* (國史大綱, *Guoshi dagang*), first published in 1940, remains a highly influential work that presents a sweeping narrative of China's historical development from a culturally grounded perspective. This book, among his more than 70 published works totaling over 17 million characters, cemented his reputation as a master historian. Other significant works include *Chronological Studies of the Pre-Ts'in Philosophers* and *Chinese Intellectual History of Recent Three Hundred Years*.

In 1949, amidst the political upheaval in mainland China, Qian Mu relocated to Hong Kong. There, with the support of others, he co-founded New Asia College, an institution established with the mission of upholding and disseminating Chinese culture and scholarship. He served as the college's first president, fostering an environment where traditional learning could flourish. New Asia College later became a constituent college of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Qian Mu's philosophical views often emphasized the distinctiveness of Chinese culture and its divergence from Western paradigms. He was critical of what he saw as the dichotomous thinking prevalent in Western thought, which he contrasted with a more integrated and holistic Chinese perspective. He believed that a deep understanding and appreciation of China's own historical and philosophical traditions were essential for the nation's self-affirmation and future development, particularly in the face of Western influence.

In his later years, Qian Mu moved to Taiwan, continuing his research and writing. He received honorary doctorates from institutions like Yale University and the University of Hong Kong, recognizing his immense scholarly achievements. Throughout his long life, Qian Mu remained a steadfast advocate for the study of Chinese history and culture, urging generations to remember and cherish their heritage. His legacy endures through his extensive writings and the institutions he helped shape, continuing to inspire discussions about tradition, modernity, and cultural identity in the Chinese-speaking world.
