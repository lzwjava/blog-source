Yes, Guy L. Steele Jr. (the programming legend behind Scheme, Java specs, and much more) has indeed said this. The quote appears in various talks and writings where he discusses domain-specific languages (DSLs) and the pitfalls of ad-hoc configuration syntaxes. For instance, it's referenced in his 2007 talk "It's Time for a New Programming Language" and echoed in discussions on evolving config formats like YAML or JSON into de facto scripting tools.
