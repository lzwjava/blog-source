It's difficult to definitively name the "best" programmers or computer scientists as it's subjective and depends on the criteria used for evaluation. Both fields have produced numerous individuals who have made groundbreaking contributions. However, we can highlight some highly influential figures in each area.

**Highly Influential Programmers:**

* **Dennis Ritchie:** Creator of the C programming language and co-creator of the UNIX operating system. C has had a profound impact on modern computing and influenced many other programming languages.
* **Linus Torvalds:** Creator of the Linux kernel, which powers a vast number of systems worldwide, from smartphones to servers. He also created Git, a widely used version control system.
* **Bjarne Stroustrup:** Creator and developer of the C++ programming language, which is used in a wide range of applications, including system software, game development, and high-performance computing.
* **Tim Berners-Lee:** Inventor of the World Wide Web, including HTTP, HTML, and URLs. His work fundamentally changed how we access and share information.
* **Guido van Rossum:** Creator of the Python programming language, known for its readability and versatility, making it popular for web development, data science, and more.

**Highly Influential Computer Scientists:**

* **Alan Turing:** Considered one of the fathers of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He conceptualized the Turing machine, a theoretical model of computation, and played a crucial role in breaking the Enigma code during World War II.
* **John von Neumann:** Made significant contributions to many fields, including computer architecture (the von Neumann architecture is still used in most computers today), mathematics, physics, and game theory.
* **Donald Knuth:** Author of "The Art of Computer Programming," a highly influential series of books on algorithms and data structures. He is also known for creating the TeX typesetting system.
* **Grace Hopper:** A pioneer in computer programming who developed the first compiler for a computer programming language and was instrumental in the development of COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages.
* **Edsger Dijkstra:** A highly influential computer scientist who made fundamental contributions to programming methodology, algorithm design, and formal verification. He is known for Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.

It's important to note that many individuals have made significant contributions to both programming and computer science, and the distinction between the two can sometimes be blurred. For example, someone who designs a new programming language is contributing to both areas.

Rankings of countries with strong programming talent often include China, Russia, Poland, Switzerland, and Hungary, based on performance in coding challenges and the size of their developer communities. However, "best" is subjective and depends on the specific skills and context being considered.
