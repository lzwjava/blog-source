### Key Points
- It seems likely that to use `org.joda.time`, you need to add it to your Java project and import its classes for date and time operations.
- Research suggests including the library via Maven with version 2.13.1 or downloading the JAR file, then using classes like `DateTime` and `LocalDate`.
- The evidence leans toward Joda-Time being useful for handling time zones, calendar systems, and time intervals, with examples like creating date objects and modifying them.

### What is Joda-Time and How to Set It Up
Joda-Time is a library for handling dates and times in Java, especially useful before Java 8, offering an intuitive API to replace the older, less thread-safe `Date` and `Calendar` classes. To use it, first include the library in your project. If using Maven, add this dependency to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>joda-time</groupId>
    <artifactId>joda-time</artifactId>
    <version>2.13.1</version>
</dependency>
```
Alternatively, download the JAR file from [this website](https://www.joda.org/joda-time/download.html) and add it to your project's classpath, such as in Eclipse by creating a "libs" folder and linking the JAR via project properties.

### Basic Usage Examples
Once set up, import classes like `org.joda.time.DateTime` or `org.joda.time.LocalDate`. Here are some examples:
- Create a current date-time: `DateTime now = new DateTime();`
- Access fields: `int year = now.getYear(); String monthName = now.monthOfYear().getAsText();`
- Modify: `DateTime future = now.plusDays(5);`

### Advanced Features
Joda-Time supports time zones (e.g., `DateTimeZone.forID("America/New_York")`) and different calendar systems (e.g., Coptic via `CopticChronology.getInstance()`). It also handles intervals and durations, like `Interval interval = new Interval(startDt, endDt);`.

An unexpected detail is that Joda-Time is considered a "finished" project, with Java 8's `java.time` package recommended for new projects, but it's still relevant for legacy systems or specific needs.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Guide to Using `org.joda.time`

This section provides a detailed exploration of using the `org.joda.time` library, expanding on the direct answer with additional context and technical depth, suitable for developers seeking a thorough understanding. It includes setup, usage examples, key features, and further resources, ensuring a complete reference for implementation.

#### Introduction to Joda-Time
Joda-Time, developed by joda.org, is a widely used date and time processing library, particularly before the release of Java 8. It addresses design issues in the Java `Date` and `Calendar` classes, such as thread-safety concerns, by using immutable classes. Before Java 8, the `Date` class and `SimpleDateFormatter` were not thread-safe, and operations like day/month/year offsets were counterintuitive (e.g., days starting at 0, months at 1, requiring `Calendar`). Joda-Time offers a clean, fluent API and supports eight calendar systems, compared to Java's two (Gregorian and Japanese Imperial). After Java 8, the authors consider Joda-Time largely finished, recommending migration to `java.time` (JSR-310) for new projects, but it remains relevant for legacy systems or specific use cases.

#### Setting Up Joda-Time
To use Joda-Time, you must first include it in your Java project. The latest version as of March 3, 2025, is 2.13.1, ensuring stability and compatibility with JDK 1.5 or later. For Maven users, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>joda-time</groupId>
    <artifactId>joda-time</artifactId>
    <version>2.13.1</version>
</dependency>
```
This can be found on [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/joda-time/joda-time). For non-Maven projects, download the `.tar.gz` file from [this website](https://www.joda.org/joda-time/download.html), extract it, and add the `joda-time-2.13.1.jar` to your project's classpath. For example, in Eclipse, create a "libs" folder, copy the JAR, and link it via Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add Jars. Test setup with `DateTime test = new DateTime();` to ensure functionality.

#### Basic Usage and Examples
Once included, import classes from `org.joda.time`, such as `DateTime`, `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, and `LocalDateTime`, all of which are immutable for thread safety. Here are detailed examples:

- **Creating Date-Time Objects:**
  - From current time: `DateTime now = new DateTime();` uses the default time zone and ISO calendar.
  - From a Java `Date`: `java.util.Date juDate = new Date(); DateTime dt = new DateTime(juDate);` for interoperability.
  - From specific values: Constructors accept `Long` (milliseconds), `String` (ISO8601), or other Joda-Time objects, e.g., `DateTime dt = new DateTime(2025, 3, 3, 8, 39);`.

- **Accessing Fields:**
  - Use getter methods: `int year = now.getYear(); int month = now.getMonthOfYear();` where January is 1 and December is 12.
  - For textual representation: `String dayName = now.dayOfWeek().getAsText();` outputs, e.g., "Monday" for March 3, 2025.
  - Check properties: `boolean isLeap = now.year().isLeap();` returns `false` for 2025.

- **Modifying Date-Time:**
  - Create new instances with modifications: `DateTime newDt = now.withYear(2025);` or `DateTime future = now.plusDays(5);`.
  - Add durations: `DateTime later = now.plusHours(2);` for adding two hours, returning a new instance.

A practical example from GeeksforGeeks illustrates usage:
```java
import org.joda.time.DateTime;
import org.joda.time.LocalDateTime;
public class JodaTime {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DateTime now = new DateTime();
        System.out.println("Current Day: " + now.dayOfWeek().getAsText());
        System.out.println("Current Month: " + now.monthOfYear().getAsText());
        System.out.println("Current Year: " + now.year().getAsText());
        System.out.println("Current Year is Leap Year: " + now.year().isLeap());
        LocalDateTime dt = LocalDateTime.now();
        System.out.println(dt);
    }
}
```
For March 3, 2025, output might include "Current Day: Monday", "Current Month: March", "Current Year: 2025", "Current Year is Leap Year: false", and a timestamp like "2025-03-03T08:39:00.000".

#### Key Features and Advanced Usage
Joda-Time offers robust features for complex date-time operations, detailed as follows:

- **Time Zones:**
  - Managed via `DateTimeZone`, supporting named zones (e.g., "Asia/Tokyo") and fixed offsets. Example:
    ```java
    DateTimeZone zone = DateTimeZone.forID("America/New_York");
    DateTime nyTime = new DateTime(zone);
    ```
  - Default zone matches JDK's, but can be overridden with `DateTimeZone.setDefault(zone);`. Time zone data updates manually several times a year, based on [global-tz](https://github.com/JodaOrg/global-tz).

- **Calendar Systems:**
  - Supports seven systems: Buddhist, Coptic, Ethiopic, Gregorian, GregorianJulian, Islamic, Julian, with provision for custom systems. Example:
    ```java
    Chronology coptic = CopticChronology.getInstance();
    LocalDate copticDate = new LocalDate(coptic);
    ```
  - Defaults to ISO calendar, historically inaccurate before 1583, but suitable for modern civil use.

- **Intervals, Durations, and Periods:**
  - `Interval`: Represents a time range, half-open (start inclusive, end exclusive), e.g., `Interval interval = new Interval(startDt, endDt);`.
  - `Duration`: Exact time in milliseconds, e.g., `Duration duration = new Duration(interval);`, useful for adding to instants.
  - `Period`: Defined in fields (years, months, days, etc.), inexact in milliseconds, e.g., `Period period = new Period(startDt, endDt);`. Example difference: Adding 1 day at daylight savings (e.g., 2005-03-26 12:00:00) with `plus(Period.days(1))` adds 23 hours, while `plus(new Duration(24L*60L*60L*1000L))` adds 24 hours, highlighting period vs. duration behavior.

| **Property Methods Examples**| `monthOfYear().getAsText()`, `monthOfYear().getAsShortText(Locale.FRENCH)`, `year().isLeap()`, `dayOfMonth().roundFloorCopy()` |
| **Default Calendar System**  | ISO calendar system (de facto civil calendar, historically inaccurate before 1583)              |
| **Default Time-Zone**        | Same as JDK default, can be overridden                                                         |
| **Chronology Class**         | Supports multiple calendar systems, e.g., `CopticChronology.getInstance()`                     |
| **Time-Zone Example**        | `DateTimeZone zone = DateTimeZone.forID("Asia/Tokyo");`, `GJChronology.getInstance(zone)`      |
| **Interval Class**           | `Interval` - holds start and end date-time, operations based on range                          |
| **Period Class**             | `Period` - holds period like 6 months, 3 days, 7 hours, can derive from interval               |
| **Duration Class**           | `Duration` - exact duration in milliseconds, can derive from interval                          |
| **Period vs Duration Example**| Adding 1 day at daylight savings (2005-03-26 12:00:00): `plus(Period.days(1))` adds 23 hours, `plus(new Duration(24L*60L*60L*1000L))` adds 24 hours |

An interesting detail is the extensibility of object constructors, allowing conversion from JDK `Date` or `Calendar` by passing them directly, simplifying migration from legacy code.
