Neither JD.com nor Pinduoduo.com publicly offer APIs specifically designed for automating purchases, such as setting up a cron job to buy items like tissue monthly. Below is a detailed breakdown based on available information:

### **JD.com**
- **API Availability**: JD.com provides APIs through its **JD Open Platform** (also known as JD Alliance or Jingdong Open Platform) primarily for merchants, developers, and business partners. These APIs focus on functions like product listing, order management, inventory tracking, and logistics for sellers, not for automating consumer purchases.[](https://marketingtochina.com/sell-on-jd-merchants-guide/)[](https://appinchina.co/how-to-become-a-seller-on-jd-com/)
- **Automated Purchasing**: There is no official documentation indicating that JD.com offers APIs for consumers to automate purchases directly. However, posts on X mention third-party tools like "JdBuyer," a tool for Windows and macOS that supports automated purchasing on JD.com. This suggests that unofficial or third-party solutions exist, but they are not part of JD’s official API offerings and may violate platform terms of service.
- **Challenges**: JD.com has strict policies to prevent bot-driven purchases, especially during high-demand events like Singles' Day, to ensure fair access for users. Automated purchasing scripts could risk account suspension or be blocked by anti-bot measures. Additionally, JD’s consumer-facing platform requires user authentication (e.g., JD Wallet or WeChat Pay), which complicates automation without manual intervention.[](https://marketingtochina.com/sell-on-jd-merchants-guide/)[](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2018/09/the-chinese-retail-revolution-is-heading-west/)
- **Alternative**: Services like **DDPCH** offer assisted purchasing from JD.com, where a third party handles sourcing and buying on your behalf. This is a manual service, not an API, and is geared toward international buyers.[](https://ddpch.com/assisted-purchase/)

### **Pinduoduo.com**
- **API Availability**: Pinduoduo does not publicly advertise consumer-facing APIs for automated purchasing. Their platform is heavily focused on social e-commerce and group buying, with dynamic pricing based on user interactions (e.g., sharing links to reduce prices). APIs, if any, are likely reserved for merchants to manage listings or integrate with Pinduoduo’s marketplace services, not for automating consumer purchases.[](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/22/what-is-pinduoduo-chinese-ecommerce-rival-to-alibaba.html)[](https://chinagravy.com/how-pinduoduo-works/)
- **Automated Purchasing**: Pinduoduo’s group-buying model, where prices drop with more participants, makes automation complex. The platform requires social interactions (e.g., sharing via WeChat) and has time-sensitive deals (e.g., 24-hour group buy windows), which are not conducive to cron-based automation. No evidence of official APIs for automated buying exists in public documentation.[](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/22/what-is-pinduoduo-chinese-ecommerce-rival-to-alibaba.html)
- **Challenges**: Like JD.com, Pinduoduo employs anti-bot measures to protect its platform, especially given its focus on flash sales and group deals. Unofficial automation tools may exist, but using them could violate Pinduoduo’s terms and lead to account restrictions. Additionally, Pinduoduo’s integration with WeChat Pay and “password-less payments” requires user authentication, complicating automation.[](https://chinagravy.com/how-pinduoduo-works/)
- **Alternative**: Similar to JD.com, third-party assisted purchasing services could handle recurring orders, but these are not API-driven and require manual coordination.

### **Key Considerations**
- **Platform Policies**: Both JD.com and Pinduoduo have strict policies against unauthorized automation to prevent scalping or abuse during high-demand sales. Using unofficial tools or scripts could lead to account bans or legal issues.
- **Third-Party Tools**: Tools like JdBuyer or similar scripts mentioned on X suggest that some users have developed unofficial solutions. However, these are not endorsed by the platforms and carry risks.
- **Assisted Purchasing Services**: For recurring purchases like tissue, services like DDPCH can act as intermediaries, handling orders manually on your behalf from JD.com or Pinduoduo. This is a safer but less automated option.[](https://ddpch.com/assisted-purchase/)
- **Technical Barriers**: Both platforms require authentication (e.g., via WeChat Pay or JD Wallet), and their dynamic interfaces (especially Pinduoduo’s personalized bazaar-like app) make scraping or automation challenging without official API support.[](https://chinagravy.com/how-pinduoduo-works/)[](https://marketingtochina.com/sell-on-jd-merchants-guide/)

### **Recommendations**
1. **Check Official Developer Portals**:
   - For JD.com, explore the **JD Open Platform** (https://open.jd.com/) to see if any new consumer-facing APIs have been released, though current APIs are merchant-focused.
   - For Pinduoduo, check their official site (https://www.pddholdings.com/) or contact their developer support for any API updates, as none are publicly documented for consumer automation.
2. **Use Assisted Purchasing Services**: If automation is not feasible, services like DDPCH can handle recurring orders from JD.com or Pinduoduo, especially for international buyers.[](https://ddpch.com/assisted-purchase/)
3. **Avoid Unofficial Tools**: Tools like JdBuyer may work but risk violating platform policies. If you pursue this, proceed cautiously and review terms of service.
4. **Contact Platforms Directly**: Reach out to JD.com or Pinduoduo’s customer service to inquire about subscription-based or recurring purchase options, as they may offer manual solutions for regular orders like tissue.

If you’re set on automation and can’t find official APIs, you might need to explore custom solutions with a developer, but be aware of the risks. Would you like me to search for more recent information on X or the web to see if new APIs or tools have emerged?
