Ah, I see — you’re now asking about **“1.0 eyesight” or “5.0 eyesight”**, which is different from the **diopter (度数 D)** measure we just discussed. Let’s clear up the two systems:

---

## 1. The Two Systems

* **Diopters (D, 度数)** → used in prescriptions, e.g. −4.00 D for 400° myopia. It directly relates to the focal length of your eye.
* **Visual acuity (视力表, like 1.0, 5.0, 20/20)** → this is what you get on a vision chart test, and it measures how small details you can resolve at a given distance.

They’re related but **not the same**.

---

## 2. Visual Acuity “1.0”

* **1.0 eyesight in China/Japan scale ≈ 20/20 in Snellen (Western) scale**
* That means: at 5 m (or 20 feet), you can read the same line that a person with “normal” vision can.
* This corresponds to **perfect or standard normal vision**.
* It doesn’t mean “you can only see 5 m away”; it means you can resolve a certain level of detail at 5 m. In practice, you can still see **infinity clearly**, just like an emmetropic (0D) eye.

---

## 3. Visual Acuity “5.0”

This sounds like the **Chinese decimal chart system**:

* **5.0 = 1.0 (20/20)**
* **5.1 = 1.1 (20/17)**
* **5.2 = 1.2 (20/16)**
* … up to **5.3, 5.4, 5.5** which correspond to **better-than-normal vision** (20/12 or sharper).

So if you say **5.0 eyesight**, that’s **normal vision (20/20)**.
If you say **1.0 eyesight**, that also means **normal vision (20/20)**, just another scale.

## 4. The Key Difference

* **Visual acuity (1.0, 5.0, 20/20)** → “How small letters/details can you resolve at a given test distance.”
* **Diopters (D)** → “At what maximum distance can you see clearly without correction.”

They’re not directly interchangeable. Someone can have **−4.00 D myopia (25 cm far point)** but still test at **1.0 (20/20)** on a chart **with glasses on**.

---

👉 So:

* **1.0 eyesight** = normal 20/20 vision (clear to infinity).
* **5.0 eyesight (Chinese scale)** = also normal 20/20.
* If you have **better than 5.0** (e.g. 5.2, 5.3), you can see sharper than average — like “20/15” or “20/12”.

Do you want me to show you a **mapping table between diopters (近视度数) and eyesight values (like 5.0, 4.8, 4.6)**? That’ll connect the two systems directly.
