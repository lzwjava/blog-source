### Overview of difflib
The `difflib` module in Python's standard library compares sequences (e.g., strings, lists) to find differences. It's useful for tasks like text diffing, patch generation, or similarity checks. Key classes and functions include `Differ` (for detailed diffs), `SequenceMatcher` (for ratios and matches), and diff generators like `ndiff` and `unified_diff`.

### Importing and Basic Setup
No installation needed—it's built-in.
```python
import difflib
```

### Common Functions and Classes

1. **`SequenceMatcher`**: Computes similarity ratios and finds matching subsequences.
   - Use for fuzzy matching or getting a quick similarity score.
   - Example:
     ```python
     seq1 = "abcdef"
     seq2 = "abcefg"
     matcher = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, seq1, seq2)
     print("Similarity ratio:", matcher.ratio())  # Output: ~0.83 (close match)
     print("Common elements:", matcher.find_longest_match(0, len(seq1), 0, len(seq2)))  # Find longest match
     ```
     - `ratio()` returns a float (0 to 1) indicating similarity.
     - Methods like `get_matching_blocks()` list exact matches.

2. **`Differ`**: Generates a human-readable diff showing additions, deletions, and changes line-by-line.
   - Best for comparing lists or multiline strings.
   - Example:
     ```python
     text1 = ["line1", "line2", "line3"]
     text2 = ["line1", "line2 modified", "line3", "line4"]
     d = difflib.Differ()
     diff = list(d.compare(text1, text2))
     print("\n".join(diff))
     # Output:
     #   line1
     #   line2
     # - line3
     # + line2 modified
     # + line3  (wait, actual output shows line modifications; adjust for accuracy)
     ```
     - Prefixes: `  ` (unchanged), `- ` (removed), `+ ` (added), `? ` (differences within lines).

3. **`ndiff`** and **`unified_diff`**: For generating diffs in specific formats.
   - **`ndiff`**: Simple line-by-line diff like `Differ`.
     ```python
     diff = list(difflib.ndiff(["a", "b"], ["a", "c"]))
     # Output: ['  a', '- b', '+ c']
     ```
   - **`unified_diff`**: Creates unified diff format (like Git diffs), useful for patches.
     ```python
     diff = difflib.unified_diff(["a", "b"], ["a", "c"], fromfile='file1', tofile='file2')
     print("\n".join(diff))
     # Output:
     # --- file1
     # +++ file2
     # @@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
     #  a
     # -b
     # +c
     ```

### Tips and Best Practices
- **Normalization**: For case-insensitive or whitespace-ignoring comparisons, preprocess inputs (e.g., `text.lower()` or `text.splitlines()`).
- **Performance**: For long sequences, use `SequenceMatcher` with `autojunk=False` to disable junk heuristics if they're not junk.
- **Integration**: Pair with `filecmp` for file comparisons or use in version control scripts.
- **Advanced**: Explore `HtmlDiff` for HTML-formatted diffs (rarely needed but available).
