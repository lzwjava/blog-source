title: Missing JAR Files In WebSphere Liberty
translated: false
---

In WebSphere Liberty, you’ve noticed warnings in the `console.log` file that look like this: *"the manifest class path: grpc-protobuf.jar cannot be found in jar file ..ear/war or its parent"*. These warnings indicate that the server cannot locate the `grpc-protobuf.jar` file, which is referenced in the manifest class path of an EAR or WAR file in your application. Below, I’ll address your questions: whether these warnings matter, whether they will impact the running of your application, and how to remove them.

---

### Do These Warnings Matter?

Yes and no—it depends on whether the missing JAR is required by your application:

- **If the JAR is Necessary:**  
  If `grpc-protobuf.jar` contains classes or resources that your application needs at runtime, this warning is significant. Without the JAR, your application could encounter runtime errors like `ClassNotFoundException`, which might cause parts of it to fail or behave incorrectly.

- **If the JAR is Not Needed:**  
  If the JAR is not actually required—perhaps it’s a leftover reference from an old configuration or an optional dependency—the warning is harmless and won’t affect your application’s functionality. However, it will still clutter your logs.

In short, these warnings matter if the missing JAR is critical to your application. You’ll need to investigate to determine its importance.

---

### Will It Impact the Running of the Application?

The impact on your application’s runtime depends on the role of the missing JAR:

- **Yes, If the JAR is Required:**  
  If your application attempts to use classes or resources from `grpc-protobuf.jar` and it’s missing, you’ll likely see runtime errors. This could prevent your application from working correctly or cause it to fail entirely.

- **No, If the JAR is Unnecessary:**  
  If the JAR isn’t needed, your application will run fine despite the warning. The message will simply remain in the logs as a nuisance.

To confirm, check your application’s behavior and logs for errors beyond the warning itself. If everything works as expected, the JAR may not be essential.

---

### How to Remove the Warning?

To eliminate the warning, you need to either ensure the JAR is properly included in your application or remove the unnecessary reference to it. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Verify If the JAR Is Needed:**  
   - Review your application’s documentation, source code, or dependency list (e.g., `pom.xml` if using Maven) to determine if `grpc-protobuf.jar` is required.  
   - If it’s not needed, proceed to step 3 to remove the reference. If it is needed, continue to step 2.

2. **Correct the Packaging (If the JAR Is Needed):**  
   - Ensure `grpc-protobuf.jar` is included in the correct location within your application package:  
     - **For a WAR file:** Place it in the `WEB-INF/lib` directory.  
     - **For an EAR file:** Place it in the root of the EAR or a designated library directory (e.g., `lib/`).  
   - Rebuild and redeploy your application to confirm the JAR is now found by WebSphere Liberty.  
   - Check the `console.log` to see if the warning disappears.

3. **Update the Manifest (If the JAR Is Not Needed):**  
   - Open the `MANIFEST.MF` file in your EAR or WAR, located in the `META-INF/` directory.  
   - Look for the `Class-Path` attribute, which might look something like this:  
     ```
     Class-Path: grpc-protobuf.jar some-other-lib.jar
     ```  
   - Remove the reference to `grpc-protobuf.jar` so it no longer appears in the list.  
   - Save the file, rebuild your application, and redeploy it. The warning should no longer appear.

4. **Check Classpath Configuration:**  
   - If your application uses shared libraries or custom classloaders in WebSphere Liberty, verify that the server’s configuration (e.g., `server.xml`) includes the necessary JARs or doesn’t incorrectly reference `grpc-protobuf.jar`.  
   - Adjust the configuration if needed and restart the server.

### General Advice

- **Investigate Warnings:** Even if the application seems to run fine, it’s a good practice to understand the cause of warnings to avoid surprises later.  
- **Test After Changes:** After adding the JAR or updating the manifest, test your application thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected.  
- **Keep Logs Clean:** Resolving unnecessary warnings keeps your logs clear, making it easier to spot real issues in the future.

By following these steps, you can determine whether the `grpc-protobuf.jar` warning is critical, address any potential runtime impact, and remove the warning from your `console.log` in WebSphere Liberty.

---

When you run `mvn package` to build an EAR file and encounter warnings about missing JARs (like `grpc-protobuf.jar`) in the manifest class path, it’s unlikely that the issue stems from missing command-line arguments. The `mvn package` command itself is sufficient to trigger the Maven build lifecycle up to the `package` phase, which includes compiling, testing, and packaging your EAR. However, the warning suggests a configuration issue in your Maven project rather than a problem with the command or its arguments. Let’s explore this step by step.

---

### What Does the Warning Mean?

The warning indicates that the `MANIFEST.MF` file in your EAR references `grpc-protobuf.jar` in its `Class-Path` attribute, but this JAR is not found in the expected location within the EAR (e.g., the `lib/` directory). The `Class-Path` attribute lists JARs that your application needs at runtime, and a missing JAR could lead to runtime errors like `ClassNotFoundException`.

---

### Is It About Missing Arguments?

No, you don’t need additional arguments with `mvn package` to resolve this. Maven relies on your project’s `pom.xml` files and plugin configurations (like the `maven-ear-plugin`) to determine what gets included in the EAR and how the manifest is generated. Adding arguments like `-DskipTests` or `-U` might tweak the build process, but they won’t directly address this warning. The root cause lies in your project setup, not the command itself.

---

### Common Causes of the Warning

Here are the likely reasons for the warning:

1. **Missing Dependency Declaration**  
   If `grpc-protobuf.jar` is required by your application, it might not be declared as a dependency in your EAR module’s `pom.xml` or its submodules (e.g., a WAR or JAR module).

2. **Incorrect Dependency Scope**  
   If `grpc-protobuf.jar` is declared with a scope like `provided`, Maven assumes it’s supplied by the runtime environment (e.g., WebSphere Liberty) and won’t package it in the EAR.

3. **Unwanted Manifest Entry**  
   The `maven-ear-plugin` might be configured to add `grpc-protobuf.jar` to the `Class-Path` in the manifest, even though it’s not included in the EAR.

4. **Transitive Dependency Issue**  
   The JAR might be a transitive dependency (a dependency of another dependency) that’s either excluded or not properly included in the EAR.

---

### How to Investigate

To pinpoint the issue, try these steps:

1. **Check the Manifest File**  
   After running `mvn package`, unzip the generated EAR and look at `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`. Check if `grpc-protobuf.jar` is listed in the `Class-Path`. This confirms whether the warning matches the manifest’s content.

2. **Review the EAR’s `pom.xml`**  
   Look at the `maven-ear-plugin` configuration. For example:
   ```xml
   <plugin>
       <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
       <artifactId>maven-ear-plugin</artifactId>
       <version>3.2.0</version>
       <configuration>
           <version>7</version> <!-- Match your Java EE version -->
           <defaultLibBundleDir>lib</defaultLibBundleDir>
       </configuration>
   </plugin>
   ```
   Ensure it’s set up to include dependencies in the `lib/` directory (or wherever your JARs should go).

3. **Inspect Dependencies**  
   Run `mvn dependency:tree` on your EAR module to see if `grpc-protobuf.jar` appears. If it’s missing, it’s not declared anywhere in your dependency tree.

4. **Look at Submodules**  
   If your EAR includes WARs or JARs, check their `pom.xml` files for dependencies on `grpc-protobuf.jar`.

---

### How to Fix It

Depending on what you find, apply one of these solutions:

1. **If the JAR Is Needed**  
   Add `grpc-protobuf.jar` as a dependency in your EAR’s `pom.xml`:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
       <artifactId>grpc-protobuf</artifactId>
       <version>1.39.0</version> <!-- Use the correct version -->
   </dependency>
   ```
   Ensure the `maven-ear-plugin` includes it in the EAR (e.g., in the `lib/` directory).

2. **If the Scope Is Wrong**  
   If it’s declared as `<scope>provided</scope>` but needs to be packaged, change it to `<scope>compile</scope>` (the default scope).

3. **If the JAR Isn’t Needed**  
   If `grpc-protobuf.jar` shouldn’t be in the manifest, check for custom manifest configurations in the `maven-ear-plugin`:
   ```xml
   <configuration>
       <manifestFile>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</manifestFile>
   </configuration>
   ```
   Remove any manual entries for `grpc-protobuf.jar`, or let Maven generate the manifest automatically.

4. **Handle Transitive Dependencies**  
   If it’s a transitive dependency you don’t need, exclude it:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>some.group</groupId>
       <artifactId>some-artifact</artifactId>
       <exclusions>
           <exclusion>
               <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
               <artifactId>grpc-protobuf</artifactId>
           </exclusion>
       </exclusions>
   </dependency>
   ```

5. **Rebuild and Verify**  
   Run `mvn clean package` to rebuild the EAR, then check the output EAR file to ensure the warning is gone and the structure is correct.

---

### Conclusion

The `mvn package` command itself doesn’t require additional arguments to fix this warning. Instead, the issue is likely due to a misconfiguration in your `pom.xml` or the `maven-ear-plugin`. By ensuring `grpc-protobuf.jar` is either properly included (if needed) or removed from the manifest (if not needed), you can eliminate the warning. Start by inspecting your manifest and dependencies, then adjust your configuration accordingly. This should resolve the issue without changing your build command.
