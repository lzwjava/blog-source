It seems like you’re asking about Max Maeder, and given your previous questions about sailing, I’ll assume you want information about his involvement in the sport. Max Maeder is a prominent Singaporean kitefoiler, and I’ll provide a detailed overview of his background, achievements, and significance in sailing based on what’s publicly known as of April 4, 2025.

### Who is Max Maeder?
Maximilian "Max" Maeder, born on September 12, 2006, is an 18-year-old professional athlete from Singapore, renowned for his prowess in Formula Kite, a high-speed kitefoiling discipline that debuted at the 2024 Paris Olympics. He was born to a Swiss father, Valentin Maeder, and a Singaporean Chinese mother, Hwee Keng Maeder, and grew up with two younger brothers, Karl and Valentin Jr. His multicultural upbringing—spanning Singapore, Switzerland, and Wakatobi, Indonesia (where his family ran a dive resort)—shaped his early exposure to water sports. Max is fluent in English, Mandarin, German, Swiss German, and French, and was homeschooled to balance his education with his sailing career.

### Sailing Career and Achievements
Max’s journey in kitefoiling began at age six when his father introduced him to kiteboarding. By age 10, he transitioned to kitefoiling, and at 11, he competed in his first professional race, the 2018 Formula Kite Asian Championships in Zhuhai, China, which he won. His career took off from there, marked by a string of impressive victories:

- **Youth Success**: He won the Formula Kite Youth World Championships three years in a row (2021–2023) and the Youth Sailing World Championships in the same period, establishing himself as a prodigy.
- **Senior Breakthrough**: In August 2023, at age 16, Max clinched the Formula Kite World Championships in The Hague, Netherlands, becoming the youngest world champion in any Olympic sailing class. He defended this title in May 2024 in Hyères, France, winning 15 of 18 races in the opening series.
- **Asian Games**: At the 2022 Asian Games (held in 2023 due to delays), he dominated all 16 races, securing gold despite the medal series being canceled due to weather.
- **Olympic Glory**: In his Olympic debut at the 2024 Paris Games, Max won a bronze medal in the Men’s Formula Kite event on August 9, 2024—Singapore’s National Day. At 17, he became Singapore’s youngest Olympic medalist and the nation’s first sailing medalist. He finished behind Austria’s Valentin Bontus (gold) and Slovenia’s Toni Vodišek (silver) in a final stretched over two days due to low wind conditions.
- **Recent Wins**: Post-Olympics, Max continued his dominance, winning the 2024 KiteFoil World Series, the Formula Kite Youth European Championships (open event), and the KiteFoil Asian Championships in September 2024.

### Recognition and Impact
Max’s consistency is remarkable—he’s secured podium finishes in every competition since the 2021 European Championships. His achievements earned him a nomination for the World Sailor of the Year in 2023 (won by Australia’s Tom Slingsby) and, more notably, the inaugural Young World Sailor of the Year award at the 2024 World Sailing Awards on November 5, 2024, in Singapore. This made him the first Singaporean to win a World Sailing Awards trophy. Public voting, which accounted for 50% of the decision, reflected his widespread support.

His success has elevated kitefoiling’s profile in Singapore, where the sport has only about 150 active participants, mostly older adults. The local sailing community sees his Olympic bronze as a potential game-changer, inspiring younger generations and prompting calls for more youth programs in kitefoiling and related disciplines.

### Personal Traits and Support
Max is often compared to Formula 1’s Max Verstappen for his dominance and youth, with kitefoiling described as “Formula One meets chess” due to its speed and strategy. He’s known for his maturity, mental resilience, and love for chess (his Chess.com puzzle rating is 2650), which he superstitiously ties to his racing performance. His family, coaches (including Croatian Ivica “Johnny” Dolenc), and the Singapore Sailing Federation, along with the Sport Excellence Scholarship since 2022, form his robust support system. In July 2024, Singapore’s Ministry of Defence granted him a four-year National Service deferment to prepare for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, recognizing his medal potential.

### Fun Fact
After winning the Young World Sailor award, Max honored a promise to work at Soon Soon Huat Curry Puff in Katong, serving curry puffs—a snack he loves—on November 7, 2024, showcasing his down-to-earth personality.

### Why He Matters
Max Maeder isn’t just a talented athlete; he’s a trailblazer for Singaporean sailing and kitefoiling globally. His youth, skill, and consistency make him a standout figure, and with the 2028 Olympics on the horizon, he’s poised to chase gold and further cement his legacy.
