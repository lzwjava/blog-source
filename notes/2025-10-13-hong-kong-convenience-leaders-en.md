In Hong Kong, the major convenience store chains are **7-Eleven**, **Circle K**, and **759 Store** (also known as 759 Arkon). These dominate the market, with 7-Eleven leading by a wide margin (over 900 outlets as of recent data), followed by Circle K (around 400-500 stores) and 759 Store (about 200-300 locations focused on discounted imported snacks and groceries). Smaller players like OK Convenience Store exist but aren't as widespread.

They're ubiquitous for quick grabs like snacks, drinks, groceries, SIM cards, alcohol, and cigarettes, often open 24/7.
