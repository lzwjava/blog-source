In Python, the `int` type has **no fixed range** or size limit. Unlike languages like C or Java, where integers are constrained by specific bit sizes (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit), Python's `int` is arbitrary-precision, meaning it can grow as large as available memory allows. This applies to both Python 2 (since Python 2.2, where `long` and `int` were unified) and Python 3.

### Key Points:
- **No Upper or Lower Bound**: Python integers can represent any whole number, positive or negative, limited only by the system's memory. For example, you can have extremely large numbers like `10**100` or very negative numbers like `-10**100`.
- **Memory Usage**: The memory required for an `int` grows dynamically as the number’s magnitude increases. Python uses a variable-length encoding to store large integers.
- **Performance**: Operations on very large integers (e.g., `2**1000000`) may be slower due to the increased memory and computational overhead, but they are still supported.

### Example:
```python
# Small integer
small = 42
print(small, type(small))  # 42 <class 'int'>

# Large integer
large = 2**1000
print(large, type(large))  # 107150860718626732... <class 'int'>

# Negative integer
negative = -10**100
print(negative, type(negative))  # -10000000000... <class 'int'>
```

### Relation to Your Previous Query:
In your TigerOpen API issue, the `order_id` (`359248847525015552`) is an integer well within Python’s `int` range, so there’s no concern about overflow or truncation in Python itself. The `biz param error` is likely due to the API’s expectations (e.g., requiring a string `order_id`) rather than a Python integer limitation. The suggestion to try `str(order_id)` in the `get_order` call addresses this potential mismatch.

### Additional Notes:
- **System Limitations**: While Python’s `int` has no theoretical limit, practical limits arise from available RAM. Extremely large integers (e.g., `2**1000000`) may consume significant memory.
- **Type Checking**: Use `isinstance(x, int)` to check if a variable is an integer.
- **Conversion**: You can convert strings or floats to integers using `int()`, but be cautious with floats to avoid precision loss (e.g., `int(3.9)` yields `3`).
