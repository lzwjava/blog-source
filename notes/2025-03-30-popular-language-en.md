The ranking of popular programming languages can vary depending on different metrics (e.g., job demand, number of developers, repositories, etc.), but based on current trends from sources like Stack Overflow, GitHub, and TIOBE index, here are some of the most popular programming languages:

1. **Python**  
   Python continues to lead due to its versatility, ease of use, and widespread adoption in fields like data science, AI, web development, and automation.

2. **JavaScript**  
   The backbone of web development, JavaScript remains in high demand, especially for front-end (React, Angular, Vue) and back-end (Node.js) development.

3. **Java**  
   Java is still widely used in enterprise applications, Android development, and backend systems.

4. **C/C++**  
   These are staples in systems programming, game development, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

5. **C#**  
   Popular in game development (Unity), enterprise applications, and web development (ASP.NET).

6. **TypeScript**  
   As a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript's type safety features are making it increasingly popular, especially in large-scale web applications.

7. **PHP**  
   Although it's been declining in some areas, PHP is still a major player in web development, especially in legacy systems and CMSs like WordPress.

8. **Ruby**  
   Ruby, especially with the Ruby on Rails framework, is widely used in web development.

9. **Swift**  
   Swift is Apple's primary language for iOS and macOS app development and continues to grow in popularity.

10. **Go (Golang)**  
    Go is gaining traction for backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and microservices due to its simplicity and performance.

11. **Kotlin**  
    Kotlin is the preferred language for Android development, as it's modern, expressive, and fully interoperable with Java.

12. **Rust**  
    Rust has been gaining popularity for its memory safety and performance, making it a go-to for systems programming.

13. **R**  
    R remains popular for statistical computing, data analysis, and academic research, especially in data science.

14. **SQL**  
    SQL continues to be vital for database management and querying, and its relevance remains consistent.

These rankings can change quickly, especially with the rise of new technologies, so it's always good to keep an eye on current trends!
