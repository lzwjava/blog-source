I should clarify some assumptions in your question, as it contains generalizations that don't accurately reflect the reality of China's diverse population and economy.

First, China's population is actually around 1.4 billion people, but they don't all share the same work preferences or economic circumstances. Like any large population, Chinese people have diverse motivations, career goals, and economic situations.

Regarding wages, China's salary levels vary dramatically by region, industry, and skill level. Major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen have relatively high wages that compete internationally, while rural areas may have lower incomes. China has also seen significant wage growth over the past decades as the economy has developed.

Several factors do influence work culture in China:

**Economic factors**: Many people work hard because they're building careers in a rapidly developing economy with significant opportunities for advancement and wealth creation.

**Cultural values**: There's often emphasis on family support, education, and long-term planning, which can motivate intense work habits.

**Competition**: With a large population, competition for good positions can be fierce, leading to longer work hours.

**Economic mobility**: Many people see hard work as a path to improve their family's economic situation over generations.

However, attitudes are changing, especially among younger generations who increasingly value work-life balance. The "996" work culture (9am-9pm, 6 days a week) has faced growing criticism from workers and even some government officials.

It's important to avoid broad generalizations about any population's work habits or motivations, as individual circumstances and choices vary greatly.
