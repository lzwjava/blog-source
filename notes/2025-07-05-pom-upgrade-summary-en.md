**Important Considerations Before Upgrading:**

* **Breaking Changes:** Always check the release notes for each component you plan to upgrade. Major version bumps (like from JUnit 5 to 6, or Surefire 3.0.0-M7 to 3.5.3) might introduce breaking changes that require code modifications.
* **Compatibility:** Ensure that the new versions are compatible with your Java version (JDK 21 in your case) and other dependencies in your project.
* **Testing:** After upgrading, thoroughly test your application to ensure everything still functions as expected.
