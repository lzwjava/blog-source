The difference between the tire sizes **195/55R16** (the new tire) and **185/55R16** (the original tire specified in your car's manual) lies primarily in the width and overall dimensions of the tire. Here's a breakdown of the differences and how they might relate to the issue you described (feeling the wheel or tire hitting something when turning right):

### **Tire Size Breakdown**
- **195/55R16**:
  - **195**: The tire's width is 195 mm.
  - **55**: The aspect ratio (sidewall height) is 55% of the tire's width (195 × 0.55 = ~107.25 mm).
  - **R16**: The tire fits a 16-inch wheel rim.
- **185/55R16**:
  - **185**: The tire's width is 185 mm (10 mm narrower than the 195 tire).
  - **55**: The aspect ratio is also 55% of the tire's width (185 × 0.55 = ~101.75 mm).
  - **R16**: The tire also fits a 16-inch wheel rim.

### **Key Differences**
1. **Width**:
   - The 195/55R16 tire is 10 mm wider than the 185/55R16 tire.
   - A wider tire can slightly increase grip and stability but may also increase rolling resistance and slightly affect fuel efficiency.

2. **Sidewall Height**:
   - The sidewall height of the 195/55R16 tire is ~107.25 mm, while the 185/55R16 tire is ~101.75 mm. This means the new tire has a slightly taller sidewall (by about 5.5 mm).

3. **Overall Diameter**:
   - The overall diameter of the tire is calculated as: sidewall height × 2 + rim diameter.
     - For **195/55R16**: (107.25 mm × 2) + 406.4 mm (16 inches) = ~620.9 mm.
     - For **185/55R16**: (101.75 mm × 2) + 406.4 mm = ~609.9 mm.
   - The 195/55R16 tire is approximately 11 mm (or ~1.1 cm) larger in diameter than the 185/55R16 tire, a difference of about 1.8%.

4. **Impact on Fitment**:
   - The wider and slightly taller 195/55R16 tire takes up more space in the wheel well compared to the original 185/55R16 tire.
   - While the difference is small, it could cause clearance issues, especially during sharp turns, if the wheel well or suspension components have tight tolerances.

### **Relation to the Issue (Hitting Something When Turning Right)**
The issue you described—feeling the wheel or tire hitting something when turning the steering wheel to the rightmost position, but resolving when turning slightly left—could indeed be related to the tire size change. Here’s why:

1. **Clearance Issues**:
   - The wider 195 mm tire (vs. 185 mm) extends further outward, potentially coming closer to or contacting parts of the car’s body, such as the wheel well, fender liner, or suspension components (e.g., control arms or struts), especially during sharp turns.
   - Since the issue occurs only when turning fully to the right, the wider tire may be rubbing against something on the right side of the wheel well or suspension when the steering is at full lock.

2. **Deformed Wheel Rim**:
   - You mentioned that the wheel rim was deformed, and the technician used glue to address air leaks. A deformed rim could exacerbate clearance issues:
     - The rim’s shape may no longer align perfectly with the tire, causing uneven contact or slight wobbling.
     - If the deformation is on the outer edge, it could bring the tire closer to the car’s body or suspension, increasing the likelihood of rubbing during sharp turns.

3. **Tire Sidewall and Diameter**:
   - The slightly larger diameter and taller sidewall of the 195/55R16 tire could also contribute to reduced clearance in the wheel well, especially if your car’s suspension or wheel well design has tight tolerances for the original 185/55R16 tire.
   - The difference in diameter (1.8%) is small but could affect how the tire interacts with the car’s body during turns.

4. **Alignment and Steering Geometry**:
   - Installing a tire with a different size than recommended can slightly alter the steering geometry or suspension behavior. This might cause the tire to move differently during turns, potentially leading to contact with parts of the car.
   - If the tire was not properly mounted or balanced, or if the rim’s deformation affects its alignment, this could also contribute to the sensation of “hitting” something.

### **Does This Relate to the Tire Change?**
Yes, the issue is likely related to the tire size change from 185/55R16 to 195/55R16, combined with the deformed wheel rim. The wider tire and the rim’s condition could be causing the tire to rub against the wheel well, fender liner, or suspension components when turning fully to the right.

### **What to Do**
1. **Inspect for Rubbing**:
   - Check the inner and outer edges of the right front tire and wheel well for signs of rubbing (e.g., scuff marks, worn rubber, or scratched paint).
   - Have a mechanic inspect the wheel well and suspension components while turning the steering wheel to the rightmost position to identify where the tire is making contact.

2. **Check the Rim**:
   - The deformed rim is a concern. A damaged rim can cause improper tire seating, vibrations, or air leaks. Consider having the rim repaired or replaced to ensure safe operation.
   - Ensure the rim is properly balanced with the new tire to avoid uneven wear or vibrations.

3. **Revert to Original Tire Size**:
   - If possible, replace the 195/55R16 tire with the original 185/55R16 tire size recommended by your car’s manual. This will restore the intended clearance and handling characteristics.
   - Using a non-recommended tire size can also affect speedometer accuracy, fuel economy, and handling.

4. **Alignment Check**:
   - Have your car’s alignment checked, as the tire change and rim deformation could have affected it. Misalignment could contribute to uneven tire movement or rubbing during turns.

5. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Visit a reputable tire or auto shop to assess the fitment of the 195/55R16 tire on your car. They can confirm whether the tire size is safe for your vehicle and check for clearance issues.
   - Ask them to inspect the deformed rim and recommend whether it needs repair or replacement.

### **Safety Note**
Driving with a tire that rubs against the car’s body or suspension can lead to tire damage, loss of control, or further damage to the vehicle. Additionally, a deformed rim may compromise the tire’s ability to hold air or maintain stability. Address this issue promptly to ensure safe driving.
