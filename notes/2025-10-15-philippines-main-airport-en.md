The major airport in the Philippines is **Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA)**, located in Manila. It's the country's primary international gateway, handling the majority of domestic and international flights, with over 40 million passengers annually before recent expansions.

Other notable airports include Mactan–Cebu International Airport (in Cebu City) and Clark International Airport (near Angeles City), but NAIA remains the busiest and most central hub.

A new mega-airport, the New Manila International Airport in Bulacan, is under construction and expected to open in 2026, which will eventually rival or surpass NAIA in capacity.
