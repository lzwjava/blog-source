### 🔧 Core Features

* **Text to 3D**: Users can input descriptive text prompts (e.g., “retro sci-fi toaster, brushed aluminum”) to generate detailed 3D models complete with geometry and textures.

* **Image to 3D**: By uploading single or multi-view images, Meshy converts them into watertight, UV-wrapped 3D assets with PBR (Physically-Based Rendering) textures.

* **AI Texturing**: Existing 3D models can be enhanced with realistic textures using text prompts or reference images, eliminating the need for manual UV mapping.

* **Rigging and Animation**: Meshy offers automatic rigging for biped and quadruped characters, along with a library of over 500 game-ready animations, facilitating seamless integration into game engines.

* **Smart Remesh**: Users can adjust polygon counts and switch between triangle and quad topologies to balance detail and performance, optimizing models for various applications.

* **Multilingual Support**: The platform supports prompts in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, Chinese, and Japanese, broadening accessibility for a global user base.
