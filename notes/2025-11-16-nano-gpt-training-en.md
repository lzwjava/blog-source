title: NanoGPT Training Iteration Time Explained
translated: false
type: note
---

Yes — in NanoGPT’s training logs, that **“time” value is the wall-clock duration for a single training iteration**.

Here’s what that timing represents:

### What is measured in that number?

It’s the actual elapsed time needed to finish **one optimizer step**, which includes:

* forward pass
* backward pass
* gradient update
* any fused kernels
* dataloader overhead (if any)
* logging overhead (minimal)

So in your log:

```
iter 200: loss 6.6062, time 3838.34ms, mfu 12.67%
```

This means:

* Each training step at this point takes **3.838 seconds per iteration**.
* MFU shows how fully your GPU’s flops are being used.

### Why can one step be several seconds?

Common reasons:

* Large context length
* Small GPU batch size leading to inefficient launch patterns
* Model too large for the GPU, triggering more memory operations
* Slow CPU-side dataloader
* Using a single parquet file or non-sharded dataset
* Gradient checkpointing (adds overhead)

If you want, tell me your:

* model size
* block size
* batch size
* GPU model
* dataset setup

Then I can estimate whether ~3.8 s/iter is expected or if something’s misconfigured.
