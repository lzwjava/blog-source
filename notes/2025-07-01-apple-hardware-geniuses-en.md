Great question. In Apple's history, **a few figures besides Steve Wozniak** had strong expertise in electronics and digital systems — people who understood the kinds of topics covered in **"Fundamentals of Electronic Technology (III)"** at a **deep engineering level**. These individuals were crucial in building Apple’s hardware foundation, especially during the **Apple I/II, Macintosh, iPod, and early iPhone** eras.

## 🔧 Engineers at Apple with Deep Hardware/Electronics Knowledge

### 🥇 **Steve Wozniak**

* **Era**: 1976–1985 (formally), lifetime influence
* **Strengths**: Analog/digital design, microprocessors, low-level hardware, TTL logic
* **Legacy**: Designed almost the entire Apple I and II hardware himself

---

### 🧠 **Burrell Smith**

* **Era**: Joined 1979 (Macintosh Team)
* **Role**: Hardware Designer for the original **Macintosh 128K**
* **Expertise**: Digital logic, analog video circuits, board-level integration
* **Contributions**:

  * Created a cost-effective, high-performance digital board for the Mac using clever TTL logic tricks (e.g., using fewer chips than standard).
  * Was a **genius with logic gates and board optimization**, similar to Woz.

---

### 🔬 **Tony Fadell**

* **Era**: 2001–2008 (iPod, iPhone development)
* **Role**: Led the iPod team, involved in iPhone hardware
* **Expertise**: Systems design, embedded electronics, power management
* **Contributions**:

  * Deeply involved in the **SoC (System-on-Chip)** integration for iPod/iPhone
  * Oversaw hardware-software integration, including low-level logic and power design
  * Later founded **Nest**, showing strong grounding in sensor/mixed-signal systems

---

### 🔧 **Bob Mansfield**

* **Era**: 1999–2013 (then returned for Apple Watch and AR work)
* **Role**: SVP of Hardware Engineering
* **Expertise**: System-level architecture, power electronics, integration
* **Contributions**:

  * Led hardware design across MacBook, iMac, iPad, and iPhone
  * Oversaw **PCB layout**, signal integrity, power management, and **thermal design**
  * Less hands-on than Woz, but deeply knowledgeable about electronics design at system scale

---

### ⚡ **Johny Srouji**

* **Era**: 2008–present
* **Role**: SVP of Hardware Technologies
* **Expertise**: **Semiconductor design**, **SoC architecture**, **mixed-signal and digital logic**
* **Contributions**:

  * Led creation of Apple’s in-house **A-series chips** (used in iPhones, iPads)
  * Expert in **digital circuits**, **custom silicon**, **FPGA/ASIC**, and system performance
  * Overlaps deeply with **Part II (Digital Electronics)** and **PLD/HDL** topics from the textbook

---

### 🖥️ **Mike Culbert**

* **Role**: Veteran Apple hardware engineer (often behind the scenes)
* **Expertise**: Power systems, system architecture, low-level hardware
* **Contributions**:

  * Credited on multiple Apple patents related to power management and efficient circuit integration
  * Likely had deep knowledge of **DC power**, **switching regulators**, **signal processing**

## 🧰 Summary Table – Apple Engineers & Electronics Mastery

| **Name**          | **Era**      | **Strength in Electronics Topics**                        | **Comparable to Woz?**           |
| ----------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Steve Wozniak** | 1976–1985    | Analog, digital, power, CPU, TTL circuits                 | ✅ Yes – original master          |
| **Burrell Smith** | 1979–1985    | Digital logic, analog video, minimalistic TTL designs     | ✅ Close match                    |
| **Tony Fadell**   | 2001–2008    | Embedded systems, SoC, system integration                 | 🟡 Similar, more system-level    |
| **Bob Mansfield** | 1999–2013+   | Hardware architecture, power, system board integration    | 🟡 More of a manager, still deep |
| **Johny Srouji**  | 2008–present | SoC, chip design, HDL, digital logic, silicon integration | ✅ Yes – on digital/HDL side      |
| **Mike Culbert**  | 1990s–2010s  | Power electronics, circuit optimization                   | 🟡 Quiet but likely strong       |

## 🎯 Conclusion

If we define “**Woz-class**” in terms of:

* Low-level analog + digital electronics
* Hands-on design with minimal components
* Intimate knowledge of circuit behavior and microprocessors

Then the **closest matches** in Apple history are:

* **Burrell Smith** (Macintosh)
* **Tony Fadell** (iPod/iPhone)
* **Johny Srouji** (chip design, especially HDL/PLD side)

Woz remains unique in his **DIY, minimalist genius**, but Apple has had other brilliant engineers who could “read and write” the electronics textbook — just in different eras and contexts.

Let me know if you want to deep dive into any of their specific designs or patents!
