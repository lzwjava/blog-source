俞军 (Yu Jun) is a legendary figure in the Chinese internet industry, widely regarded as one of the most influential product managers in China. He is best known for his work at Baidu, where he was the company’s first product manager and later served as Vice President of Product, and for his contributions to Didi Chuxing as a senior product executive. His book, *Yu Jun’s Product Methodology* (*俞军产品方法论*), published in 2019, encapsulates his philosophy and approach to product management, blending insights from economics, psychology, and practical experience. Below, I address your questions about his product ideas, theory, and personal story based on available information, including web sources and posts on X.[](https://book.douban.com/subject/34907971/)[](https://deepinbook.com/yu-jun-product-methodology/yu-jun-product-methodology.html)[](https://blog.devtang.com/2020/02/03/pm-work-from-yujun/)

### 1. **Yu Jun’s Product Ideas**
Yu Jun’s product ideas revolve around creating *profitable user value* by deeply understanding users and designing products that facilitate efficient transactions. His core concepts include:

- **User Model and Transaction Model**:
  - **User Model**: Yu Jun emphasizes that product managers must understand users not as individuals but as a collection of needs. For example, the same user may choose JD.com for fast delivery or Pinduoduo for cost-effectiveness, reflecting distinct needs within one person.[](https://blog.devtang.com/2020/02/03/pm-work-from-yujun/)[](https://www.woshipm.com/pmd/3402762.html)
  - **Transaction Model**: Products should be designed to maximize transactions by balancing user value and business profitability. He introduces two key formulas:
    1. **User Value = New Experience - Old Experience - Switching Costs**: This quantifies how much value a product provides by comparing the new experience to the old one, factoring in the cost of switching from existing alternatives.[](https://www.samirchen.com/rn-the-product-methodology-of-yujun/)[](https://blog.naaln.com/2022/02/yujun-product/)
    2. **Relative Price = (Direct Costs + Transaction Costs) ÷ Utility Combination**: This formula helps product managers evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a product from the user’s perspective, considering both tangible costs and intangible factors like convenience.[](https://www.samirchen.com/rn-the-product-methodology-of-yujun/)

- **Leveraging New Production Factors**: Yu Jun highlights the importance of capitalizing on emerging technologies or societal shifts (e.g., mobile internet, mobile payments) to create products that ride the wave of “population dividends” or new user behaviors. For instance, he attributes the rise of content monetization and live streaming to mature mobile payment systems.[](https://www.samirchen.com/rn-the-product-methodology-of-yujun/)

- **Focus on Profitable User Value**: He stresses that enterprises exist to create user value that is financially sustainable. Products must balance user needs with business viability, avoiding the trap of pursuing user value without profitability.[](https://blog.devtang.com/2020/02/03/pm-work-from-yujun/)[](https://blog.orangesai.com/p/return-to-essence-thoughts-interpretation-yu-jun-product-methodology-15-points)

- **Critical Thinking and Decision-Making**: Product managers should cultivate critical thinking and rational decision-making, grounded in understanding constraints (e.g., resources, time) and making trade-offs to maximize value.[](https://blog.zengrong.net/post/reading-notes-yujun/)[](https://www.woshipm.com/pmd/3402762.html)

- **Iterative Practice**: Yu Jun advocates for rapid iteration and learning from large user bases. Products should be launched quickly, tested in practice, and refined based on feedback, especially from large-scale user data to minimize noise.[](https://blog.zengrong.net/post/reading-notes-yujun/)[](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%25E4%25BF%259E%25E5%2586%259B/5349)

### 2. **Yu Jun’s Theory**
Yu Jun’s product methodology is a fusion of microeconomics, behavioral psychology, and practical product management, forming what some call a “product school of thought.” Key aspects of his theory include:[](https://www.woshipm.com/pmd/3402762.html)

- **Economics and Psychology as Foundations**: He integrates microeconomic concepts like utility, marginal benefits, opportunity costs, and transaction costs with behavioral psychology principles such as loss aversion and anchoring effects. This interdisciplinary approach helps product managers analyze user behavior and design products that align with both user needs and business goals.[](https://www.woshipm.com/pmd/3402762.html)

- **User as a Collection of Needs**: Yu Jun’s maxim, “There is no such thing as a ‘user,’ only a collection of needs,” challenges product managers to focus on specific, context-driven demands rather than assuming a one-size-fits-all user persona.[](https://blog.orangesai.com/p/return-to-essence-thoughts-interpretation-yu-jun-product-methodology-15-points)

- **Rational Decision-Making Framework**: He emphasizes rational decision-making under uncertainty, advocating for a process that accounts for cognitive biases, incomplete information, and the need to evaluate decisions based on whether they included all key variables and avoided better alternatives in hindsight.[](https://blog.zengrong.net/post/reading-notes-yujun/)

- **Long-Term Perspective**: Yu Jun encourages product managers to anticipate societal and technological changes, aligning products with macro trends. For example, he suggests that high-potential product managers should work on products with large user bases to gain meaningful feedback and should consider business models that ensure commercial sustainability.[](https://blog.zengrong.net/post/reading-notes-yujun/)

- **Value of Experience and Wisdom**: He proposes a formula for a product manager’s value: **Value = Experience Level × Platform Fit × Wisdom Level**. This underscores the importance of accumulating deep experience, choosing the right company or role, and developing high-level cognitive abilities like empathy and strategic thinking.[](https://blog.zengrong.net/post/reading-notes-yujun/)

His theory is not a step-by-step guide but a framework for thinking critically and systematically about product development. Critics note that its abstract nature can make it challenging to apply directly, but it provides a robust mental model for tackling complex product problems.[](https://www.samirchen.com/rn-the-product-methodology-of-yujun/)[](https://deepinbook.com/yu-jun-product-methodology/yu-jun-product-methodology.html)

### 3. **Yu Jun’s Story**
Yu Jun’s journey is a remarkable tale of self-transformation and influence in China’s internet industry:

- **Early Life and Entry into Tech**: Born in 1975, Yu Jun graduated from Tongji University in 1997 with a degree in chemistry, not technology. Under the online pseudonym “Search Engine 9238,” he became one of China’s earliest search engine enthusiasts, running a personal website called “Search Research Institute” to study and promote search technology.[](https://book.douban.com/subject/34907971/)[](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%25E4%25BF%259E%25E5%2586%259B/5349)

- **Baidu (2001–2009)**: In 2001, Yu Jun joined Baidu as its first product manager, initially as a product market manager. With no formal technical background, he rose to Vice President of Product by 2007, shaping Baidu’s early products. He was instrumental in creating iconic products like Baidu Search, Baidu Tieba (a forum platform, often called “the father of Tieba”), and Baidu Knows. His “PM 12 Rules” (e.g., focus on the majority of users, iterate quickly, prioritize user experience) became a guiding philosophy for product managers in China.[](https://book.douban.com/subject/34907971/)[](https://deepinbook.com/yu-jun-product-methodology/yu-jun-product-methodology.html)[](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%25E4%25BF%259E%25E5%2586%259B/5349)

- **Post-Baidu Reflection**: After leaving Baidu in 2009, Yu Jun took time to reflect and deepen his understanding of product management. He began studying economics and psychology from scratch to address his questions about user value and commercial value, marking a period of intellectual reinvention.[](https://book.douban.com/subject/34907971/)

- **Didi Chuxing (2016–2019)**: Invited by Didi’s CEO Cheng Wei, Yu Jun joined Didi to lead product efforts and build its product team. During this time, he interviewed over 500 product managers to refine his selection criteria and continued to develop his methodology. His focus was on mentoring the next generation of product managers and pushing the boundaries of product thinking.[](https://book.douban.com/subject/34907971/)[](https://blog.devtang.com/2020/02/03/pm-work-from-yujun/)

- **Legacy and Impact**: Yu Jun’s work has influenced countless product managers in China. His book, *Yu Jun’s Product Methodology*, and the “PM 12 Rules” remain foundational texts in the industry. He is celebrated for his ability to combine practical execution with theoretical rigor, transitioning from a “naive idealist” focused on social progress through search to a pragmatic thinker obsessed with value, cost, and user behavior.[](https://book.douban.com/subject/34907971/)[](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27558808)

- **Personal Philosophy**: Yu Jun’s story reflects a commitment to continuous learning and self-challenge. He famously said that product managers should strive to “break through one step further” in understanding their craft and that innovation requires conscious effort. His curiosity about whether “conscious innovation is possible” drives his ongoing exploration.[](https://book.douban.com/subject/34907971/)

### 4. **Critical Perspective**
While Yu Jun’s contributions are widely praised, some critiques exist:
- His methodology is highly abstract, making it difficult for junior product managers to apply without significant experience.[](https://www.samirchen.com/rn-the-product-methodology-of-yujun/)
- His focus on large-scale products and mature companies may not fully address the needs of early-stage startups, where trial-and-error can yield high rewards for less experienced managers.[](https://blog.zengrong.net/post/reading-notes-yujun/)
- The Chinese internet’s unique context (e.g., rapid growth, large user bases) shapes his ideas, which may not translate perfectly to other markets.[](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27558808)

### 5. **Conclusion**
Yu Jun’s product ideas emphasize creating profitable user value through a deep understanding of user needs and transaction dynamics, grounded in economic and psychological principles. His theory provides a robust, if abstract, framework for rational decision-making and long-term thinking in product management. His story—from a chemistry graduate to a self-taught product visionary—illustrates resilience, curiosity, and a relentless pursuit of clarity in a complex field. For those interested in diving deeper, his book *Yu Jun’s Product Methodology* is highly recommended, though it requires patience to unpack its dense concepts.[](https://www.samirchen.com/rn-the-product-methodology-of-yujun/)[](https://book.douban.com/subject/34907971/)
