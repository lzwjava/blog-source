Thanks — the `docker inspect` output confirms the container is **Dead** and that your MongoDB data directory is a host bind-mount:
`/Users/lzwjava/projects/LibreChat/data-node:/data/db:rw`.
That’s good news — your MongoDB *data files are on your macOS host*, so they can be backed up before we do any destructive Docker-side cleanup.

Below are two safe paths. **Path A (recommended)** keeps your data and is simpler: back up the host data directory, then use Docker Desktop’s Troubleshoot → Clean / Purge. **Path B (advanced / last-resort)** goes for low-level deletion of Docker VM state. I’ll give exact commands so you can copy/paste.

---

# Path A — recommended (backup host data, then use Docker Desktop reset)

1. Confirm the host data directory exists and list its contents:

```bash
ls -la /Users/lzwjava/projects/LibreChat/data-node
```

2. Make a tar backup of that directory (this preserves your MongoDB files):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/docker-backups/librechat
tar -czvf ~/docker-backups/librechat/data-node-backup-$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S).tgz -C /Users/lzwjava/projects/LibreChat data-node
# result: ~/docker-backups/librechat/data-node-backup-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.tgz
```

(You can also copy the folder instead of tar if you prefer `cp -a /Users/lzwjava/projects/LibreChat/data-node ~/docker-backups/librechat/data-node-copy`.)

3. Quit Docker Desktop completely:

```bash
osascript -e 'quit app "Docker"'
```

4. Open Docker Desktop → Troubleshoot (or Preferences → Troubleshoot) → click **Clean / Purge data** (or **Reset to factory defaults** if Clean not present).

   * **Important**: This removes Docker images, containers and volumes that live inside the Docker VM, but it will **not** remove files that are bind-mounted from your macOS host (your `/Users/.../data-node` backup ensures you’re safe).

5. After Docker resets, start Docker Desktop again, verify Docker is running, then bring your Compose stack back up:

```bash
open -a Docker
# wait until Docker is healthy
docker compose up -d
```

6. Check Mongo container and data:

```bash
docker ps -a
# docker logs <new-mongo-container-id>  (if needed)
```

If something in step 5/6 looks wrong, restore the backup: stop any running mongo container, move or remove the recreated data-node folder and untar the backup into `/Users/lzwjava/projects/LibreChat/data-node`.

---

# Path B — advanced / last-resort (manual deletion of Docker Desktop VM files)

Only use this if you *cannot* use the Docker Desktop Clean/Purge UI or it didn’t solve the issue and you accept losing Docker-internal state.

1. Quit Docker Desktop:

```bash
osascript -e 'quit app "Docker"'
```

2. Backup Docker Desktop user config (optional):

```bash
cp -a ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker.backup-$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S)
```

3. Remove Docker Desktop internal state (DESTRUCTIVE — deletes containers/images inside Desktop VM):

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker
rm -rf ~/.docker
```

4. Restart Docker Desktop:

```bash
open -a Docker
```

5. Recreate your stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Again — your host bind-mounted Mongo data will remain untouched because it lives in `/Users/...` unless you manually delete it.

---

# Extra checks / commands you can paste here if you want me to review before you reset

(These are non-destructive.)

```bash
# show that data exists on host
ls -la /Users/lzwjava/projects/LibreChat/data-node

# show images and volumes so we can plan saves
docker images
docker volume ls

# docker info & ps for quick diagnostics
docker info
docker ps -a
```

If you paste the `ls -la` output for the `data-node` folder, I’ll confirm the backup looks healthy. If you prefer, proceed with Path A: back up (step 2) then run Docker Desktop → Troubleshoot → Clean / Purge — this is the cleanest fix and typically resolves the stuck `overlay2` removal error while keeping your Mongo files safe.
