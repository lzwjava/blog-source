# Free Msg: Unable to send message - Message Blocking is active. ultra paygo USA card

The "Free Msg: Unable to send message - Message Blocking is active" error on an Ultra PayGo USA card means that your carrier or device settings are currently blocking text messages from being sent. This issue can happen due to carrier restrictions, a plan that does not include texting, blocked contacts, network or SIM card issues, or messaging restrictions set either by you or the recipient.

### Common Causes and Meaning

- Message blocking is often controlled by the carrier or device settings, so it may be that your plan is data-only or does not include SMS services.
- The recipient might have blocked you, or you have accidentally blocked them.
- Parental controls, spam filters, or account status issues with Ultra PayGo (a prepaid service) can also cause message sending to be blocked.
- Weak signal, incorrectly inserted SIM, or an inactive account can trigger this error.
- This message is a carrier-generated notice indicating that the message cannot proceed to the recipient due to one of these active blocks.


### How to Fix the Issue

1. Check signal strength to ensure you have adequate coverage.
2. Verify your Ultra PayGo account is active and has sufficient balance (if prepaid) or the proper texting plan.
3. Confirm that texting is included in your mobile plan.
4. Make sure the recipient number is not blocked on your device and that you are not blocked by the recipient.
5. Restart your phone, and if needed, remove and reinsert the SIM card.
6. If the problem persists, contact Ultra PayGo or the carrier's customer support to check account settings or message blocking on their end.

This information applies specifically to prepaid and PayGo services like Ultra PayGo in the USA, where messaging can sometimes be restricted if plans or balances are limited or the carrier enforces message blocking for spam or account issues [^1][^2][^3].
