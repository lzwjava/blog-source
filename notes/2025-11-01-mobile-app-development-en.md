### Course Outline: 14567 Mobile Application Development Technology

**Course Information**  
- **Course Code**: 14567  
- **Course Name**: Mobile Application Development Technology (移动应用开发技术)  
- **Credits**: 4  
- **Level**: Specialist (专科)  
- **Professional Field**: Computer Application Technology (计算机应用技术)  
- **Exam Type**: Written (笔试); Note: There is a separate practical exam under code 14568 (1 credit).  
- **Examination Authority**: Guangdong Province Higher Education Self-Study Examination (广东省高等教育自学考试)  
- **Textbook**: *Android Mobile Development Basic Case Tutorial (2nd Edition)* by Heima Programmer (黑马程序员), People's Posts and Telecommunications Press (人民邮电出版社), ISBN: 9787115567680 (2022). The course outline aligns closely with this textbook's structure, emphasizing Android development as a core example for mobile app programming.  
- **Course Nature and Goals**: This is a practical, application-oriented course for software engineering and computer application majors, focusing on social job market needs. It teaches mobile app development using Android as the primary platform. Learners will master Android fundamentals and learn to develop mobile applications, combining theory with hands-on coding. Emphasis is on building a development environment, implementing UI, data handling, and advanced features like networking and multimedia. Self-learners should combine theoretical study with experiments, using tools like Android Studio for debugging and testing.  

**Assessment Goals**:  
Exams test comprehensive knowledge of Android development, including code implementation, problem-solving, and application design. Focus on understanding syntax, architecture, and practical scenarios. Theoretical exams cover broad topics systematically; practice emphasizes key hands-on skills (e.g., via separate 14568 exam). Use mind maps for knowledge integration and practice exercises for retention.  

**Course Content and Assessment Requirements**  
The content is structured around 12 chapters, progressing from basics to advanced topics and a capstone project. Each chapter includes theory, code examples, practical exercises, and assessments on key concepts (e.g., identification, application, analysis). Below is the hierarchical outline:

1. **Android Basics Introduction**  
   - Android overview (communication tech, history, architecture, Dalvik VM).  
   - Development environment setup (Android Studio install, emulator, SDK).  
   - First program development and structure.  
   - Resource management (images, themes/styles, layouts, strings, colors, dimensions).  
   - Debugging (unit tests, Logcat).  
   *Requirements*: Understand Android ecosystem; build/run simple apps.

2. **Android Common Interface Layouts**  
   - View basics and layout writing (XML vs. Java code).  
   - Common attributes.  
   - LinearLayout (e.g., animal matching game UI).  
   - RelativeLayout (e.g., music player UI).  
   - TableLayout (e.g., calculator UI).  
   - FrameLayout (e.g., neon light UI).  
   *Requirements*: Design responsive UIs; apply layouts in projects.

3. **Android Common Interface Controls**  
   - Simple controls (TextView, EditText, Button, ImageView, RadioButton, CheckBox, Toast).  
   - List controls (ListView with adapters, RecyclerView; e.g., shopping mall, news feed).  
   - Custom Views.  
   *Requirements*: Implement interactive elements; handle data binding.

4. **Program Activity Unit: Activity**  
   - Lifecycle (states, methods).  
   - Creation, configuration, start/close.  
   - Intent and IntentFilter.  
   - Activity jumps and data passing/return (e.g., monkey picking peaches game).  
   - Task stacks and launch modes.  
   - Fragment usage (lifecycle, creation, integration; e.g., Meituan menu).  
   *Requirements*: Manage app flow; handle fragments for modular UIs.

5. **Data Storage**  
   - Storage methods overview.  
   - File storage (write/read; e.g., save QQ login).  
   - SharedPreferences (store/read/delete; e.g., QQ login).  
   - SQLite database (creation, CRUD, transactions; e.g., green bean contacts).  
   *Requirements*: Persist data securely; query/manage databases.

6. **Content Provider**  
   - Overview.  
   - Creation.  
   - Accessing other apps (query data; e.g., read phone contacts).  
   - Content observers (monitor changes; e.g., data change detection).  
   *Requirements*: Share data across apps; implement observers.

7. **Broadcast Mechanism**  
   - Overview.  
   - Broadcast receivers (creation).  
   - Custom broadcasts (e.g., cafeteria broadcast).  
   - Broadcast types (e.g., counting ducks).  
   *Requirements*: Handle system/app events via broadcasts.

8. **Services**  
   - Overview and creation.  
   - Lifecycle.  
   - Start methods (startService, bindService).  
   - Communication (local/remote; e.g., NetEase music player).  
   *Requirements*: Run background tasks; enable inter-component communication.

9. **Network Programming**  
   - HTTP access (HttpURLConnection).  
   - WebView development (browse HTML, JS support).  
   - JSON parsing (e.g., Pinduoduo bargaining UI).  
   - Handler message mechanism.  
   *Requirements*: Fetch/parse web data; handle async operations.

10. **Graphics and Image Processing**  
    - Drawing classes (Bitmap, BitmapFactory, Paint, Canvas; e.g., draw puppy).  
    - Image effects.  
    - Animations (tween, frame-by-frame, property; e.g., flying butterflies/birds).  
    *Requirements*: Create visuals/animations; optimize graphics.

11. **Multimedia Application Development**  
    - Audio playback (MediaPlayer, SoundPool; e.g., piano).  
    - Video playback (VideoView, SurfaceView+MediaPlayer; e.g., video players).  
    *Requirements*: Integrate media; control playback.

12. **Comprehensive Project: Meituan Takeout Imitation**  
    - Project analysis (overview, environment, modules).  
    - UI demos (shops, details, orders).  
    - Server data prep.  
    - Implement shop listing, details, menu/shopping cart, orders/payment.  
    *Requirements*: Integrate all concepts into a full app.

**Additional Notes and Implementation Requirements**  
- **Study Tips**: Build lab environments early; code along with examples. Focus on 70% practice, 30% theory. Use integrated IDE prompts during practice exams.  
- **Exam Format**: Theoretical: Multiple-choice, short answer, code analysis (80% coverage of chapters 1-11). Practical (14568): Hands-on coding for core features (e.g., UI, storage, services).  
- **Updates**: Outlines may adjust with textbook revisions; check Guangdong Education Exam Authority (eea.gd.gov.cn) for latest.
