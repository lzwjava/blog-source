You’re seeing the trade-offs pretty clearly. In large companies (especially banks, fintech, or big tech) even small technical changes like upgrading a JDK or swapping a library can be much harder than in a small startup. Here’s why:

### Short-Term Slowness vs. Long-Term Benefits
- **Short-term impact**: Upgrades often introduce bugs, require regression testing, and disrupt stable workflows. This slows down immediate delivery and frustrates teams focused on quarterly goals.  
- **Long-term benefit**: Newer JDKs or libraries improve performance, security, and developer productivity. But those benefits take time to appear, so not everyone has the patience or foresight.

### Organizational Factors
- **Many stakeholders**: In big tech, every change has to pass through multiple layers—team leads, architects, risk officers, compliance, sometimes even external regulators (in banking or finance). This slows decisions dramatically.  
- **Approval processes**: Innovation isn’t just about code. It often requires design reviews, change management boards, and formal approvals. That adds overhead small startups don’t have.

### Security and Compliance
- **Data security**: In industries like finance, healthcare, or big tech with sensitive user data, security and compliance guardrails are very strict. You can’t just “try out” a new open-source library without audits, vendor checks, or legal review.  
- **Risk aversion**: Larger organizations are optimized for stability and predictability, not experimentation. Avoiding catastrophic failure often takes priority over capturing potential upside.

### Comparison with Startups
- **Startups**: Small teams, fewer dependencies, and less legacy code mean faster iteration. They can take bigger risks because they have less to lose.  
- **Big tech**: Scale, complexity, and regulatory obligations make them slower to adopt changes, even if they have more resources.

So yes—big companies are usually slower to innovate on the *infrastructure and tooling* level. Startups are better at quick adoption. However, once a big company does make a change (say, rolling out JDK 17 across thousands of services), the impact can be massive because of scale.  

👉 Would you like me to also go into **strategies big tech uses to still innovate despite these hurdles** (like “innovation sandboxes,” internal open-source, or feature flags)? That might balance the picture.
