title: Neta Auto's Failure
translated: false

---

Neta Auto, a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer under Hozon Auto, has faced significant challenges leading to financial distress and near bankruptcy. Here are the primary reasons for its struggles in China, based on available information:

1. **Declining Domestic Sales**: Neta’s sales in China have plummeted dramatically. From January to September 2024, Neta delivered only 53,853 vehicles domestically, achieving less than 30% of its annual sales target. In 2025, sales further collapsed, with just 487 vehicles sold in January and February combined, a 98% year-on-year drop in January alone. This sharp decline reflects weak consumer demand for Neta’s models, such as the Neta X and Neta L, amid fierce competition in China’s oversaturated EV market.[](https://carnewschina.com/2024/11/06/chinese-automaker-neta-reportedly-halts-production-and-cuts-salaries/)[](https://carnewschina.com/2025/04/14/neta-auto-faces-escalating-crisis-as-dealers-drotest-at-factory-gates)

2. **Strategic Missteps**: Neta initially succeeded with affordable EVs like the Neta V, surpassing competitors like Li Auto and NIO in 2022 with over 150,000 units sold. However, its shift to upmarket, technologically advanced models with higher price tags failed to resonate with consumers. The strategy, heavily influenced by former CEO Zhang Yong, prioritized B2B channels and neglected broader market demands, leading to poor sales performance.[](https://carnewschina.com/2024/11/06/chinese-automaker-neta-reportedly-halts-production-and-cuts-salaries/)[](https://carnewschina.com/2025/03/19/neta-auto-faces-financial-crisis-dismantles-rd-amid-supplier-protests/)[](https://carnewschina.com/2025/01/06/neta-website-outage-sparks-rumors-of-brands-collapse-company-reacts-angrily/)

3. **Financial Mismanagement and Debt**: Neta has accumulated significant losses, totaling 18.38 billion yuan (approximately $2.5 billion USD) from 2021 to 2023, with gross margins remaining negative (-34.4% in 2021, -22.5% in 2022, and -14.9% in 2023). By March 2025, its debt reached 9.8 billion yuan, and a critical 3 billion yuan Series E funding round fell through due to unmet conditions like resumed production and debt reduction. The company’s bank account reportedly had only 454 yuan, and it owed 2.15 million yuan in unpaid taxes.[](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2025-03-25/chinas-neta-auto-on-brink-of-collapse-as-600-million-funding-round-falls-through-102301798.html)[](https://cnevpost.com/2024/11/07/neta-massive-layoffs-report/)[](https://x.com/eseLSMN/status/1922522175824605514)

4. **Production Halts and Supplier Issues**: Neta’s main manufacturing plant in Tongxiang, Zhejiang, faced repeated production halts due to a shortage of components and unpaid supplier debts. The factory stopped production for half a month in 2024, and despite a brief reopening in January 2024, it failed to resume full operations. Suppliers protested at Neta’s Shanghai headquarters, demanding overdue payments, with some even sleeping on-site. Neta proposed converting 70% of supplier debts to equity, but this did little to restore trust.[](https://carnewschina.com/2024/11/06/chinese-automaker-neta-reportedly-halts-production-and-cuts-salaries/)[](https://carnewschina.com/2025/03/19/neta-auto-faces-financial-crisis-dismantles-rd-amid-supplier-protests/)[](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2025-03-25/chinas-neta-auto-on-brink-of-collapse-as-600-million-funding-round-falls-through-102301798.html)

5. **Layoffs and Salary Cuts**: To cut costs, Neta implemented massive layoffs, with reports suggesting up to 70% of staff were let go, though the exact figure varies by department. Remaining employees faced severe salary reductions, with some receiving only Shanghai’s minimum wage, and high-ranking employees saw cuts of up to 30%. Delayed salary payments and unpaid compensation for laid-off staff further damaged morale and public perception.[](https://carnewschina.com/2025/03/19/neta-auto-faces-financial-crisis-dismantles-rd-amid-supplier-protests/)[](https://insidechinaauto.com/2024/11/07/neta-the-latest-chinese-ev-brand-to-hit-financial-troubles/)[](https://cnevpost.com/2024/11/07/neta-massive-layoffs-report/)

6. **Fierce Market Competition**: China’s EV market is highly competitive, with established players like BYD, Tesla, and XPeng dominating through aggressive pricing and innovation. Smaller startups like Neta struggle to compete due to overcapacity, scaling difficulties, and a price war that erodes margins. The market is consolidating, with analysts predicting that only major players will survive by 2030, leaving weaker brands like Neta vulnerable.[](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Chinese-EV-maker-Neta-s-chairman-says-company-faces-battle-for-survival)[](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/troubled-china-ev-brand-neta-shutters-singapore-showroom-less-three-months-after-opening)[](https://carnewschina.com/2025/04/14/neta-auto-faces-escalating-crisis-as-dealers-drotest-at-factory-gates)

7. **Quality and Reputation Issues**: Neta has faced criticism for quality problems, including incidents of vehicles catching fire (e.g., a Neta S spontaneously igniting while charging in 2023) and significant battery degradation (one vehicle’s range dropping from 401 km to 40 km in 1.5 years). These issues, combined with reports of charging failures and connectivity issues, have damaged consumer trust.[](https://carnewschina.com/2025/01/06/neta-website-outage-sparks-rumors-of-brands-collapse-company-reacts-angrily/)[](https://carnewschina.com/2023/04/04/neta-electric-vehicle-caught-on-fire-while-driving-not-the-first-time-in-china/)

8. **Failed Funding and Investor Confidence**: Neta’s pre-money valuation dropped from 42.3 billion yuan in January 2023 to just 6 billion yuan during the halted funding round, reflecting a loss of investor confidence. State-backed shareholders, including Yichun and Nanning government investment vehicles, reportedly lost faith in the founding team, further complicating efforts to secure new financing. A rumored 6 billion yuan investment in late 2024 provided temporary relief but was insufficient to stabilize operations.[](https://carnewschina.com/2025/03/19/neta-auto-faces-financial-crisis-dismantles-rd-amid-supplier-protests/)[](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2025-03-25/chinas-neta-auto-on-brink-of-collapse-as-600-million-funding-round-falls-through-102301798.html)[](https://x.com/CNEVhome/status/1921875480296190394)

9. **Operational and Leadership Challenges**: The departure of CEO Zhang Yong, who stepped down to an advisory role, and the website outage in January 2025 sparked rumors of collapse, though Neta denied these claims. Chairman Fang Yunzhou’s strategy to focus on profitable models and international expansion has yet to yield results in China. The company’s planned IPO in Hong Kong remains uncertain amid ongoing financial woes.[](https://carnewschina.com/2025/01/06/neta-website-outage-sparks-rumors-of-brands-collapse-company-reacts-angrily/)[](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2025-03-25/chinas-neta-auto-on-brink-of-collapse-as-600-million-funding-round-falls-through-102301798.html)[](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Electric-vehicles/EV-maker-Neta-hits-skids-with-layoffs-lawsuits-and-resignations)

10. **Dealer and Customer Backlash**: Over 20 representatives from Neta’s 300+ authorized dealers protested at its factory in April 2025, demanding compensation for undelivered vehicles, operational losses, and restoration of after-sales services for Neta’s 400,000 customers. The failure to address these concerns has further eroded Neta’s domestic market presence.[](https://carnewschina.com/2025/04/14/neta-auto-faces-escalating-crisis-as-dealers-drotest-at-factory-gates)

### Overseas Context
While Neta has struggled domestically, it has pivoted to international markets, particularly Thailand, where it achieved a 16% market share in September 2024 and aims to sell 10,000 vehicles in 2025. However, expensive export projects have not generated sufficient revenue to offset domestic losses, and setbacks like the closure of its Singapore showroom in April 2025 highlight challenges in global expansion. EU tariffs and safety concerns (e.g., the Neta V-II receiving a zero-star ASEAN NCAP rating) have further complicated overseas plans.[](https://carnewschina.com/2024/11/06/chinese-automaker-neta-reportedly-halts-production-and-cuts-salaries/)[](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/troubled-china-ev-brand-neta-shutters-singapore-showroom-less-three-months-after-opening)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neta_Aya)

### Conclusion
Neta’s failure in China stems from a combination of declining sales, strategic errors, financial mismanagement, intense competition, and operational challenges. Its shift to premium models alienated its core customer base, while mounting debts, supplier disputes, and layoffs crippled operations. Quality issues and loss of investor confidence further exacerbated the crisis. Despite some success in overseas markets, Neta’s domestic struggles have pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy, with posts on X indicating a formal bankruptcy review as of May 2025.[](https://x.com/TychodeFeijter/status/1922934327047786575)[](https://x.com/techinasia/status/1922659354207039677)[](https://x.com/neotokyojapan/status/1922834237507424263)
