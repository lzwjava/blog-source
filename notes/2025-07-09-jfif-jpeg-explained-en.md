title: JFIF Is Just JPEG Explained

JFIF stands for **JPEG File Interchange Format**.

### What JFIF Is

* It’s not a different image format from JPEG, but rather a **standardized way of embedding metadata and structure inside a JPEG file**.
* Files with `.jfif` extensions are still **JPEG images** — they just explicitly declare the JFIF specification in their headers.
* Many tools (especially older ones like Windows Paint or some cameras/scanners) used `.jfif` as the default extension instead of `.jpg` or `.jpeg`.

So, when you see a `.jfif` file, you can treat it exactly the same as a `.jpg` image.

### How to Convert JFIF to Standard Image Formats

1. **Rename the Extension**

   * In most cases, simply rename `image.jfif` → `image.jpg`.
   * Since the underlying format is JPEG, most programs will open it without issue.

2. **Using Image Editors**

   * Open the `.jfif` in Photoshop, GIMP, Paint, or Preview (macOS).
   * Save/Export as `.jpg` or `.png`.

3. **Using Python (Pillow)**

   ```python
   from PIL import Image

   img = Image.open("image.jfif")
   img.save("image.jpg")   # save as JPEG
   img.save("image.png")   # or convert to PNG
   ```

4. **Using Command Line (ImageMagick)**

   ```bash
   magick image.jfif image.jpg
   ```

   Or with FFmpeg (since it can decode images too):

   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i image.jfif image.jpg
   ```

✅ In summary: **JFIF is just a JPEG**, so you can open it like any `.jpg`. If compatibility is an issue, just rename it or convert with Pillow/ImageMagick.

Do you want me to give you a quick **Python script** that can batch-convert all `.jfif` files in a folder to `.jpg`?
