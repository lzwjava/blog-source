BMAD Core is the foundational component of the BMAD Method (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development), an open-source framework designed to streamline AI-assisted software development (and extendable to other domains like creative writing or business strategy) by orchestrating specialized AI agents in an agile workflow.

### Key Aspects of BMAD Core:
- **Role and Purpose**: It acts as a "lean, fast foundation" that standardizes AI agents, workflows, policies, and templates to ensure predictable, high-quality outputs. This addresses common AI dev pain points like context loss and inconsistent planning by using structured Markdown/YAML files for agent personas, tasks, and handoffs.
- **Core Components**:
  - **Agents**: Self-contained Markdown files (e.g., in `bmad-core/agents/`) defining roles like BMAD Master (overseer), Scrum Master (planning), Dev (coding), and QA (testing). Each includes YAML configs for persona, commands, and dependencies.
  - **Templates and Markup**: A custom markup language (defined in `bmad-core/utils/template-format.md`) for reusable prompts and processing logic, enabling dynamic document generation without separate tasks.
  - **Configuration**: Centralized in files like `core-config.yaml`, which handles API keys, LLM integrations (e.g., OpenAI, Claude), and lazy-loading of resources to avoid overload.
  - **Workflows**: YAML-based blueprints that sequence tasks, dependencies, and agent collaborations via "story files" (e.g., for PRD creation, architecture design, and iterative dev cycles).
- **Installation and Use**: Set up via Python (3.9+ required) in a project directory, creating a hidden `.bmad-core` folder with all essentials. Integrates with IDEs like Cursor or VS Code for seamless agent interactions.
- **Extensibility**: Supports "expansion packs" for domain-specific agents (e.g., infrastructure DevOps or game dev), keeping the core generic and modular.

The framework is hosted on GitHub (bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) and emphasizes natural language over rigid coding, making it accessible for solo devs or teams scaling to enterprise. It's gained traction in 2025 for "vibe coding" and agentic agile, though some users note a learning curve for initial PRD setup. For hands-on setup, check the official docs or site at bmadcodes.com.
