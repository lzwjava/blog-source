The primary keyboard shortcuts for adjusting the volume on YouTube are the **Up Arrow** and **Down Arrow** keys.

* Pressing the **Up Arrow** key will **increase** the volume by 5%.
* Pressing the **Down Arrow** key will **decrease** the volume by 5%.

**Important Note:** For these shortcuts to work, make sure the YouTube video player has focus. You might need to click on the video once before using the arrow keys to adjust the volume. If the video player does not have focus, the arrow keys will likely scroll the webpage up or down instead.
