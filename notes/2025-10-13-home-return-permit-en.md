### What is the Home Return Permit?

The Home Return Permit, officially known as the **Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents** (in Chinese: **港澳居民来往内地通行证**), is a travel document issued by the Chinese government. It allows Chinese nationals who are permanent residents of Hong Kong or Macau to enter and exit mainland China for purposes like tourism, business, visiting relatives, or short-term stays (typically up to 90 days per entry). It's essentially a multiple-entry permit that serves as both a travel visa and an identity card while in the mainland. Holders can apply for endorsements (stamps or labels) on the permit for specific travel needs, and it's valid for 10 years for adults.

Yes, you're correct—it's specifically for residents of Hong Kong and Macau who hold Chinese nationality. Mainland Chinese citizens do not use this permit.

### If You're a Mainland Chinese Citizen, What Do You Call It (or the Equivalent)?

As a mainland Chinese citizen, you wouldn't refer to the Home Return Permit at all, since it's not for you. Instead, if you want to travel to Hong Kong or Macau, you'll need the **Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao** (in Chinese: **往来港澳通行证**). This is the equivalent document for mainland residents:

- It's issued by China's public security bureaus or exit-entry administrations.
- It allows multiple trips to Hong Kong and Macau for tourism, business, or family visits, with stay limits varying by endorsement (e.g., up to 7 days for individual tourism in some cases).
- You apply for specific "endorsements" on the permit for each trip, and it's valid for 5 years.

To get one, mainland residents typically apply through local police stations or online via the National Immigration Administration's system. Note that Hong Kong and Macau have their own separate immigration rules, but this permit handles the mainland side of entry/exit.

If your question meant something else by "how I call it" (e.g., a different term or context), feel free to clarify!
