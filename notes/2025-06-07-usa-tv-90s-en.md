Absolutely! The NBA experienced an unprecedented surge in popularity in the USA during the 1990s, and a *lot* of people watched it on TV. This era is widely considered the league's golden age in terms of television viewership, largely due to the dominance and cultural impact of **Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls**.

Here's why and how much:

* **The Michael Jordan Phenomenon:** Michael Jordan was not just a basketball player; he was a global icon. His incredible talent, competitive drive, and charisma captivated audiences far beyond traditional basketball fans. The Bulls' six championships in the decade (1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998) created a dynasty that people didn't want to miss.
* **NBC's "NBA on NBC" Coverage:** NBC took over the broadcast rights from CBS in 1990, and their production was lauded for its engaging broadcasts, iconic theme music ("Roundball Rock"), and strong promotion of the league's stars. They elevated the NBA to a must-watch event.
* **High Ratings for Finals and Regular Season:**
    * **NBA Finals:** The NBA Finals routinely drew massive audiences. The 1998 NBA Finals between the Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz stands as the most-watched NBA Finals series of all time, averaging **18.7 ratings / 33 share and 29.04 million viewers on NBC.** Game 6 of that series, Michael Jordan's final game with the Bulls, is the most-watched NBA game ever, with **35.89 million viewers**.
    * Other Bulls Finals also had huge viewership: the 1993 Finals averaged 27.2 million viewers, the 1997 Finals averaged 25.6 million, and the 1996 Finals averaged 24.9 million.
    * Even regular season games, particularly those featuring Michael Jordan, achieved exceptionally high ratings. A March 19, 1995 game between the Bulls and the Indiana Pacers, marking Jordan's first game back from his initial retirement, scored a **10.9 rating for NBC**, which was the highest-rated regular-season NBA game of all time.
* **Star Power Beyond Jordan:** While Jordan was the biggest draw, the 90s also featured other prominent stars like Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone, John Stockton, and the aging Magic Johnson and Larry Bird at the start of the decade. These rivalries and individual talents further fueled viewership.
* **Limited Viewing Options:** Compared to today's fragmented media landscape with countless streaming services and specialized sports channels, the 90s had fewer entertainment choices. Network television was still the dominant force, and major sporting events like the NBA were appointment viewing for a broader audience.

In essence, the 1990s was a peak period for NBA popularity in the USA, largely driven by Michael Jordan's unparalleled appeal and NBC's excellent broadcast of the games. The viewership numbers from that era, especially for the Finals, are significantly higher than what the NBA typically achieves today.
