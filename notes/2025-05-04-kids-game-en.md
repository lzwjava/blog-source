**Cut the Rope 3** is a physics-based puzzle game developed by ZeptoLab, released exclusively for Apple Arcade on October 13, 2023. Unlike its predecessors, which focused on feeding candy to the adorable green monster Om Nom, this third installment introduces a new adventure where players guide Om Nom’s son, Nibble Nom, back to Om Nom through challenging levels. Featuring fully 3D graphics for the first time in the franchise, the game takes players on a vibrant journey across diverse locations like forests, caves, and pirate-themed maps, selected via Om Nom’s compass. 

The core gameplay retains the series’ signature rope-cutting mechanics but adds innovative elements like whips for swinging between platforms, balloons for floating, and other unique tools to solve puzzles. Players aim to collect up to 10 stars per level, with scoring based on stars gathered and attempts made, while navigating obstacles and using level objects strategically. The objective is to reunite Nibble Nom with Om Nom and discover new creatures called Nommies, enhancing the storyline. With no ads or in-app purchases, Cut the Rope 3 offers a family-friendly experience, blending nostalgic mechanics with fresh challenges for fans of physics-based puzzles and cute characters.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_the_Rope)[](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/cut-the-rope-3-brings-a-new-adventure-to-apple-arcade/)[](https://www.imdb.com/es/title/tt35579405/)

The game you're describing, where players pull or pour water into cups to sort liquids by color, is likely **Cups - Water Sort Puzzle**, a popular puzzle game available on various platforms, including web browsers and mobile devices. Here's a brief introduction based on your description and relevant information:

**Cups - Water Sort Puzzle** is a casual, logic-based puzzle game developed by Grand Games A.Ş. and hosted on platforms like CrazyGames and Google Play. Players sort colored liquids into glass cups or bottles, ensuring each container holds only one color. The objective is to pour liquids from one cup to another until each cup is filled with a single color, completing the level. The catch is that you can only pour liquid into a cup if it matches the top color of the receiving cup and there’s enough space. 

With nearly 400 levels, the game starts simple but grows challenging as more colors and cups are introduced. Success triggers a confetti burst, and the sorted liquid turns into a fizzy beverage, sealed with a cork. Players can earn coins to unlock new cup styles and backgrounds, and features like undo moves or hints help when stuck. The game is free, ad-supported, and designed to test logical thinking with a relaxing yet addictive vibe.[](https://www.crazygames.com/game/cups---water-sort-puzzle)[](https://www.bubbleshooter.net/game/cups-water-sort-puzzle/)
