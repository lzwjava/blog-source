### Introduction to Neta Cars

Neta, a brand under Hozon Auto (also known as Hozon New Energy Automobile Co., Ltd.), is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer founded in 2014. Specializing in affordable, intelligent pure electric and range-extended vehicles, Neta focuses on urban mobility with models like the compact Neta V, family-oriented Neta U and X, mid-size Neta S and L, and sporty Neta GT. These cars emphasize smart tech, long range, and cost-effective ownership, making them popular in markets like China, Southeast Asia, Africa, and emerging regions. Neta vehicles feature zero emissions, low noise, and high efficiency, with prices starting around $10,000–$25,000 depending on the model and region. Key highlights include advanced driver assistance, seamless connectivity, and flexible charging, all integrated into a user-friendly ecosystem.

### Operating System: Neta OS

At the heart of Neta vehicles is **Neta OS**, a proprietary infotainment and vehicle control system designed for intuitive, connected driving. Built on reliable platforms like BlackBerry QNX Neutrino RTOS and Hypervisor for safety-critical functions, it pairs with Qualcomm's Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit (e.g., 3rd Generation in Neta S) for high-performance computing. This enables smooth multitasking across screens and supports over-the-air (OTA) updates for continuous improvements.

Key features include:
- **Large Touchscreens**: Models like Neta X feature a 17.6-inch vertical central display and an 8-inch digital instrument cluster for navigation, media, and vehicle stats.
- **Voice Control and AI**: Natural language processing for hands-free commands (e.g., "Navigate to nearest charger" or "Play playlist"). Integrated Neta GPT for conversational assistance in newer models.
- **Connectivity**: 5G/Wi-Fi support, 4G fallback, Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility, and app integration for remote monitoring via the Neta app.
- **Entertainment**: Streaming services, video playback, online music, and unique social features like TikTok overlays on maps for location-based content discovery.
- **Intelligent Driving (Neta Pilot)**: Levels 2–4 autonomy in select models (e.g., Neta S with Huawei MDC 610 platform), including adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping, automatic parking, collision warnings, and 360° cameras.

Neta OS prioritizes a minimalist, customizable interface with themes, gesture controls, and multi-user profiles for families.

### Settings and Controls

Neta cars offer extensive customizable settings via the central touchscreen or steering wheel controls, emphasizing ease for daily use. The system is divided into categories like Vehicle, Climate, Driving, and Entertainment, with haptic feedback and voice shortcuts.

- **Vehicle Settings**: Adjust drive modes (Eco, Normal, Sport), regenerative braking levels (low/medium/high for energy recovery during coasting), tire pressure monitoring, and lighting (e.g., auto high-beams). Energy management includes battery preconditioning for optimal charging.
- **Climate Controls**: Dual-zone automatic AC with heat pump efficiency (works down to -20°C), seat/steering wheel heating, and air quality sensors. Users can set schedules to balance comfort and range (e.g., avoiding extreme temps to save 10–20% battery).
- **Safety and Assistance**: Toggle features like emergency braking, blind-spot detection, and pedestrian alerts. Parking aids include ultrasonic sensors and auto-parking.
- **Infotainment Controls**: Customizable home screens, app permissions, and privacy settings. Audio volume adjusts via sliders or voice, with equalizer presets for music genres.
- **Accessibility**: Options for larger fonts, color-blind modes, and simplified menus.

Controls are driver-centric: A rotating gear selector for Drive/Reverse/Park, push-button start, and paddle shifters for regen. Manuals recommend familiarizing via the Neta app's tutorials for safe operation.

### Charging Plans and Options

Neta EVs support flexible charging to suit urban and long-haul needs, with no traditional "plans" but dealer-supported financing for home chargers in some markets. All models use CCS2 or GB/T standards, focusing on fast DC and convenient AC.

- **Battery and Range**: Capacities range from 31.7 kWh (Neta V, ~300 km range) to 91 kWh (Neta S, up to 715 km CLTC). Ternary lithium or LFP batteries ensure longevity (8-year/160,000 km warranty).
- **Fast Charging**: DC up to 100 kW; 20–80% in 30 minutes (e.g., Neta U Pro adds ~220 km in 15 min). Neta GT claims 0–80% in 0.5 hours.
- **Home/Slow Charging**: AC 6.6–7 kW; full charge in 8–17 hours. Portable Level 1 adapters included.
- **Options and Tips**: Energy recovery system recharges during braking (up to 20% range boost). Precondition battery via app for faster sessions. In regions like Africa/Philippines, dealers offer installment plans for chargers and trade-ins. Public networks integrate via Neta OS for route planning to stations.

Always charge in ventilated areas; low battery triggers warnings and limp mode.

### Volume and Capacity Details

"Volume" in Neta context likely refers to audio, cargo, or battery—here's a breakdown across popular models:

- **Audio Volume**: Integrated 6–8 speaker systems with Dolby/immersive sound. Volume controls are precise (0–100 scale), with auto-adjust for speed/ambient noise. Supports high-res audio streaming; max output ~80–90 dB without distortion.
- **Cargo Volume**: Practical for families/commutes.
  - Neta V: 500–1,150 L (rear seats folded).
  - Neta U/X: 335–588 L.
  - Neta GT: 297 L trunk + 50 L frunk.
  - Neta S/L: Up to 1,000+ L with folding seats.
- **Battery Volume/Capacity**: As noted, 31.7–91 kWh, with efficient packing (e.g., 38.54 kWh in Neta V Pro for 401 km range). No physical "volume" specs, but slim underfloor placement preserves cabin space.

### Additional Notes ("Etc.")
Neta excels in affordability and tech: Models like Neta V start at ~$11,900 with 401 km range; GT offers 190 km/h top speed for sports fans. Safety includes 5-star ratings, multiple airbags, and thermal runaway prevention. Maintenance is low (no oil changes), with 24/7 roadside via app. Future plans include three new models by 2025, expanding global reach.

For model-specific details, check local dealers or the Neta app.
