Yes, you're largely correct. AI and large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in accelerating certain aspects of scientific research and software development, but major scientific breakthroughs and significant discoveries still remain challenging and slow. Here's a breakdown of the situation:

### AI/LLM Impact on Science and Discovery
1. **Incremental Progress vs. Major Breakthroughs**:
   - AI and LLMs excel at automating repetitive tasks, analyzing vast datasets, and identifying patterns that might elude humans. For example, AlphaFold solved protein folding, a decades-old problem, by predicting protein structures with unprecedented accuracy. Similarly, AI has aided in drug discovery, materials science, and theorem proving.
   - However, truly transformative breakthroughs—those that redefine fields or introduce entirely new paradigms (e.g., relativity or quantum mechanics)—require deep conceptual leaps, creativity, and intuition that AI currently struggles to replicate. These breakthroughs often depend on human insight, serendipity, or unconventional thinking, which AI can support but not fully replace.
   - Even for someone like Terence Tao, AI tools (e.g., formal proof assistants like Lean or LLMs for idea exploration) can assist in exploring conjectures or verifying proofs, but the core creative spark for groundbreaking math discoveries still relies heavily on human intuition and expertise.

2. **Why Big Discoveries Are Still Hard**:
   - **Complexity of Problems**: Many unsolved problems in math, physics, or biology are inherently complex, with sparse data or poorly defined boundaries. AI thrives on well-structured problems with clear objectives, but breakthrough science often involves ambiguity or paradigm shifts.
   - **Novelty and Creativity**: Major discoveries often require rethinking foundational assumptions or inventing new frameworks. Current AI models, while excellent at interpolating within known domains, struggle with true novelty or "out-of-distribution" creativity.
   - **Validation and Rigor**: Scientific breakthroughs require rigorous validation, peer review, and replication, which are time-intensive processes that AI can only partially streamline.
   - **Interdisciplinary Gaps**: Many breakthroughs require synthesizing knowledge across fields, which AI can assist with but often needs human guidance to prioritize and interpret.

### AI/LLM in Software Development and Routine Tasks
1. **Significant Impact on Productivity**:
   - In software development, AI tools like GitHub Copilot, LLMs for code generation, or automated testing frameworks have dramatically boosted productivity. They handle boilerplate code, suggest optimizations, and debug efficiently, saving developers time.
   - For "normal" tasks—data analysis, report generation, or routine problem-solving—AI excels at automating workflows, reducing errors, and scaling solutions.

2. **Limitations for Complex Software Innovation**:
   - While AI can write code or optimize algorithms, designing novel architectures, creating entirely new software paradigms, or solving deeply complex problems (e.g., scalable quantum computing frameworks) still requires human ingenuity.
   - AI-generated code often needs human oversight to ensure it meets specific requirements or handles edge cases correctly.

### The Gap Between Routine and Revolutionary
- **Routine Tasks**: AI/LLMs shine in tasks with clear rules, large datasets, or repetitive processes. They’ve democratized access to tools and lowered barriers for non-experts, making incremental progress faster.
- **Revolutionary Discoveries**: Big discoveries require rare combinations of deep expertise, creativity, and persistence. AI can assist (e.g., by exploring hypotheses or analyzing data), but it’s not yet capable of independently driving paradigm-shifting discoveries. Even in math, where AI has helped formalize proofs (e.g., in projects like the Liquid Tensor Experiment), humans like Terence Tao or Peter Scholze set the direction.
- **Long Way to Go**: AI is a powerful tool, but it’s not a magic bullet. The path to breakthroughs remains slow because it depends on human curiosity, collaboration, and the ability to ask the right questions—areas where AI is a partner, not a leader.

### Evidence from Recent Trends
- **Scientific Papers**: The volume of papers has exploded, partly due to AI-assisted writing and analysis, but the rate of truly groundbreaking papers hasn’t scaled proportionally. Most papers are incremental, and citation metrics suggest high-impact discoveries remain rare.
- **AI in Math**: Tools like AlphaCode or Lean have assisted in solving competitive programming problems or formalizing proofs, but they haven’t yet produced a Fields Medal-worthy theorem independently.
- **X Posts and Web Insights**: Discussions on X highlight excitement about AI’s potential (e.g., in drug discovery or physics simulations), but many researchers note that AI often optimizes existing workflows rather than inventing new science. For instance, posts from 2024-2025 mention AI aiding in hypothesis generation but stress that human intuition is still critical for breakthroughs.

### Conclusion
AI and LLMs are transformative for routine tasks and incremental progress in software development and science. They’re invaluable assistants, even for geniuses like Terence Tao, but major discoveries—whether in math, physics, or other fields—still face the same high bar of creativity, rigor, and luck. AI narrows the gap but doesn’t yet bridge it. We’re on a promising trajectory, but there’s indeed a long way to go for AI to autonomously drive revolutionary breakthroughs.
