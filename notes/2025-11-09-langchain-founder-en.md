### LangChain Founder: Harrison Chase

Harrison Chase is the founder and CEO of LangChain, an open-source framework that simplifies building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). He launched it in October 2022 while working as a machine learning engineer at Robust Intelligence, a startup focused on AI security. What started as a simple Python package quickly exploded in popularity, becoming a go-to tool for developers integrating LLMs into apps—think chatbots, agents, and data pipelines.

#### His Story
Chase's background is a classic tech origin tale: curiosity-driven, self-taught in parts, and timed perfectly with the AI boom. Born around the mid-1990s (exact details are sparse), he graduated from Harvard University in 2017 with a degree in statistics and computer science. During college, he dove into data science and machine learning, blending stats with coding to tackle real-world problems.

Post-grad, Chase joined Robust Intelligence in 2021, where he honed his skills in LLM deployment. Frustrated by the lack of easy tools for chaining LLM calls (e.g., prompting, memory, and external integrations), he open-sourced LangChain on GitHub. It went viral almost overnight—millions of downloads, thousands of contributors—fueled by the ChatGPT hype. By late 2022, he co-founded the company around it, raising $25M+ in funding from Sequoia and Benchmark. Today, at 28-ish, he's a key voice in AI orchestration, speaking at conferences like TED AI and pushing boundaries in agentic AI. He's low-key on social media (active on X as @hwchase17) but emphasizes open-source ethics and developer empowerment.

### LangGraph: The Next Evolution
LangGraph isn't a separate project—it's a low-level extension *built by the LangChain team* (led by Chase) for more advanced, stateful AI workflows. Released in 2024, it's designed for creating cyclical, multi-agent systems (e.g., graphs where agents loop, branch, or collaborate on tasks like research or automation). Unlike linear LangChain chains, it handles complexity better—think debugging agents that self-correct or long-running processes with human-in-the-loop.

It's open-source, integrates seamlessly with LangChain, and powers things like production-grade RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) or custom LLM apps. If LangChain is the Lego bricks for LLMs, LangGraph is the blueprint for building intricate machines. No distinct founder; it's a natural outgrowth of LangChain's ecosystem.
