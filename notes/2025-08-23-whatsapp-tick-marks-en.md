title: WhatsApp Tick Marks Explained Simply

Yes, you’ve got it mostly right — WhatsApp’s tick marks work like this:

* **One gray check mark** → Your message has been sent from your phone and successfully reached the WhatsApp server.
* **Two gray check marks** → The message was delivered to the recipient’s phone (or phones, if they use multiple). It doesn’t mean they’ve read it yet.
* **Two blue check marks** → The recipient has seen/read your message (if they have read receipts enabled).

Some extra notes:

* If the other person has turned off **read receipts**, you won’t see the ticks turn blue (except in group chats, where read receipts always work).
* If they’re offline or have their phone off, your message will stay at **one gray tick** until their device comes online.
* If you’re blocked, you’ll always only see **one gray tick**.

Do you want me to also explain how this differs in **group chats**?
