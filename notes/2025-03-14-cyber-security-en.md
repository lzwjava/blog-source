To ensure cyber security in a company, a comprehensive approach is needed that addresses the specific concerns you mentioned—such as phishing emails, recipient verification, information classification, and screen locking—while also incorporating additional best practices. Below is a structured guide organized into three key areas: **People**, **Process**, and **Technology**.

### 1. People
The human element is often the first line of defense against cyber threats. Educating and empowering employees is critical.

- **Beware of Phishing Emails**: Train employees to recognize phishing attempts, which are fraudulent emails designed to steal sensitive information. Teach them to look for red flags like misspellings (e.g., "pnishing" instead of "phishing"), urgent language, or requests for personal data. Regular training sessions and simulated phishing exercises can improve awareness and response.
- **Careful About Recipients**: Encourage employees to double-check email addresses before sending sensitive information to ensure it reaches the intended recipient. A simple typo could lead to a data leak.
- **Secure Habits**: Promote the habit of locking computer screens (e.g., using Ctrl+Alt+Delete or Windows+L on Windows) whenever employees step away from their desks. This prevents unauthorized access to devices left unattended.

### 2. Process
Establishing clear policies and procedures ensures consistent security practices across the company.

- **Classify Information**: Implement a system to categorize data based on its sensitivity—such as public, internal, confidential, or restricted. Define handling rules for each level, like requiring encryption for confidential data or limiting who can access restricted files. Train employees on how to apply these classifications.
- **Access Control**: Follow the principle of least privilege, meaning employees only have access to the information necessary for their roles. Regularly review and update permissions to reflect job changes or departures.
- **Incident Response**: Develop a plan to address security breaches quickly. This should include steps for reporting incidents, containing damage, and recovering systems or data. Test the plan periodically to ensure it works.

### 3. Technology
Leveraging technical tools strengthens your defenses against cyber threats.

- **Email Security**: Deploy email filters and scanning tools to detect and block phishing attempts before they reach inboxes. Encourage employees to report suspicious emails that slip through.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive information both when it’s stored (at rest) and when it’s being sent (in transit). This ensures that even if data is intercepted or stolen, it remains unreadable without the decryption key.
- **System Maintenance**: Keep all software, operating systems, and security tools up to date with the latest patches to fix vulnerabilities. Use antivirus software to detect and remove malware.

### Additional Tips
To round out your cyber security strategy:
- **Strong Passwords and Authentication**: Require complex passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an extra layer of account security.
- **Data Backups**: Regularly back up critical data and store it securely (e.g., offsite or in the cloud) to recover quickly from ransomware or hardware failures.

By focusing on these areas—training your people, enforcing secure processes, and using reliable technology—your company can protect itself against phishing, data leaks, and other cyber risks, while ensuring both digital and physical security measures work together effectively.
