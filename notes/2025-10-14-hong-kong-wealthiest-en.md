### Top 35 Wealthiest Individuals/Families in Hong Kong with HK-Rooted Businesses (2025)

Based on the latest Forbes 2025 data (as of February 2025, with updates through October), here's an extended filtered list of the top individuals/families whose primary companies are headquartered in Hong Kong, originated there, and primarily serve the local Hong Kong market. There are approximately 35 that strictly fit these criteria out of the overall 50 richest (many others have mainland China or global focuses). I've ranked them by net worth. Net worths are in USD billions. Headcount figures are for Hong Kong-based employees where available (sourced from company reports); otherwise, noted as total group or approximate.
