Letting the sauce stay on marinated food for a few minutes before air fryer cooking can be useful, but it depends on the recipe and desired outcome. Here’s a quick breakdown:

- **Benefits**: Allowing the sauce to sit after marinating helps the flavors penetrate deeper into the food, especially for meats, vegetables, or tofu. It can also help the sauce adhere better, creating a more even coating. In an air fryer, this can lead to a caramelized or slightly crispy exterior as the sauce cooks and reduces under the high heat.

- **Considerations**: 
  - **Moisture Content**: Air fryers work best with less moisture to achieve crispiness. If the sauce is too wet or sugary, it might burn or create a sticky mess in the air fryer. Pat the food lightly with a paper towel or shake off excess sauce to avoid this.
  - **Cooking Time**: Sugary sauces (like BBQ or honey-based) can caramelize quickly or burn due to the air fryer’s intense heat. Monitor cooking closely or lower the temperature slightly (e.g., 350°F instead of 400°F).
  - **Lining the Basket**: Sauces can drip and cause cleanup issues. Use parchment paper or a silicone liner to minimize mess, but ensure proper air circulation.

- **Best Practice**: Let the sauce sit for 5-10 minutes post-marination to enhance flavor absorption, but remove excess sauce before air frying to prevent burning or sticking. For sticky glazes, consider brushing on additional sauce toward the end of cooking (last 2-3 minutes) to avoid charring.
