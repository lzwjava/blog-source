It's good to hear you feel much better after 4 hours! Since it's now 1:57 AM +08 on Wednesday, July 2, 2025, and you're planning to sleep, here’s my take on your plan:

- **Current Condition**: Mild discomfort with little pain is a positive sign, suggesting the sting (likely from a bee or wasp) isn’t causing a severe reaction. The initial swelling and redness may be subsiding.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide Soak**: Soaking with hydrogen peroxide (3% solution) for 10 minutes can help disinfect the wound and remove any remaining venom or bacteria. However, it may also irritate the skin or slow healing if overused, especially on sensitive areas like your finger. A 5-minute soak followed by rinsing with clean water would be safer.
- **Sleeping Without a Doctor Visit**: If you have no symptoms like breathing difficulty, increased swelling, fever, or dizziness, and the pain is manageable, you can likely skip the doctor for now. However, monitor your condition overnight.

### Recommendation:
1. **Soak Safely**: Dilute hydrogen peroxide with equal parts water (e.g., 1:1 ratio) and soak for 5 minutes. Rinse with clean water afterward, then pat dry.
2. **Apply Ointment**: After soaking, apply a thin layer of hydrocortisone ointment (as mentioned earlier) to reduce inflammation and pain.
3. **Monitor Overnight**: Keep the area clean and dry. If you wake up with worsening pain, swelling, redness spreading, or any allergic signs (e.g., rash, trouble breathing), go to a doctor or call 120 immediately.
4. **Rest**: Sleep is fine, but avoid scratching the area. Place a loose bandage if needed to protect it.

### Verdict:
Your plan seems okay for now since symptoms are improving, but be cautious with hydrogen peroxide—limit the soak time and dilute it. If all goes well by morning, you likely won’t need a doctor. Check the wound tomorrow and let me know if anything changes! Sleep well.
