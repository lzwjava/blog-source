As a Chinese passport holder, here’s how you can travel to Vietnam — what visa you need, how to apply, and what to watch out for:

---

## 👍 What you need

* Chinese citizens need a valid visa to enter Vietnam. ([Vietnam Visa][1])
* Passport should be valid for **at least 6 months** from your entry date. ([My Vietnam Visa][2])
* Passport needs at least **two blank pages**. ([Vietnam Visa][1])

---

## 🛂 Types of visas / options

You have a few ways to get a Vietnam visa:

1. **E-Visa (Electronic Visa)**

   * Can apply online. ([My Vietnam Visa][2])
   * Valid up to **90 days** generally, can be single or multiple entry. ([My Vietnam Visa][2])

2. **Visa on Arrival**

   * You can get this, but you’ll need a **pre-approval letter** from a Vietnamese authority or agency before you fly. ([My Vietnam Visa][2])
   * Usually for shorter stays (like 30 days) and for airports. ([My Vietnam Visa][2])

3. **Vietnam Embassy / Consulate visa (Sticker visa)**

   * Apply in person or via mail at the nearest Vietnamese embassy or consulate in China. ([BKCLAW][3])

---

## ⚠️ Important details & issues

* If your Chinese passport is an *electronic passport* (e-passport) and has certain maps printed on it (relating to disputed areas in the South China / East Vietnam Sea), there have been issues: Vietnam may refuse to stamp the passport directly and instead issue a separate free paper visa at the port of entry. ([Wikipedia][4])
* You need to enter/exit via **designated border gates**, as specified in the Vietnam e-visa system. ([Evisa][5])
