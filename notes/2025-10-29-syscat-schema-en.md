title: Understanding the SYSCAT Schema
translated: false

**SYSCAT** stands for **System Catalog** in IBM DB2. It's a schema that holds read-only views built on top of the base system catalog tables (in the SYSIBM schema). These views offer a more user-friendly and standardized way to query metadata about database objects, such as tables, columns, indexes, and routines, while keeping the underlying data normalized and protected.

For example, SYSCAT.TABLES is a view that provides details on tables, including schema, name, owner, type, and row count, without exposing the raw SYSIBM.SYSTABLES table directly.

For more details, check the [IBM DB2 documentation on catalog views](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ias?topic=reference-catalog-views).
