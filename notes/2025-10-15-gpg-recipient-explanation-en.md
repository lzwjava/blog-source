### Understanding the GPG Command and the "Recipient" Prompt

The command you're running is for encrypting a file (`inputfile.txt`) using GnuPG (GPG):

```
gpg --homedir /path/to/custom/dir -e -r recipient@example.com --encrypt inputfile.txt
```

- `--homedir /path/to/custom/dir`: Uses a custom directory for GPG's keyring and config (instead of the default `~/.gnupg`).
- `-e` (or `--encrypt`): Tells GPG to encrypt the file.
- `-r recipient@example.com`: Specifies the **recipient** (the person or entity you're encrypting *for*). This should be their email, name, or key ID from their public key.
- `--encrypt inputfile.txt`: The file to encrypt (output will be `inputfile.txt.gpg`).

#### What Does "Recipient" Mean Here?
In GPG encryption:
- The **recipient** is the person who will *receive and decrypt* the file. You encrypt the file using *their public key*, so only they (with their private key) can decrypt it.
- It's not the "sender" (you) because encryption protects the data *for the recipient*. Your role as sender is more about signing (if you add `-s` for signing), but here it's pure encryption.

You're right that this is for "sending" secure data, but the terminology focuses on the recipient because that's whose key secures it. Think of it like locking a box with someone else's padlock—they're the only one who can unlock it.

#### Why the Error: "You did not specify a user ID. (you may use '-r')" and the Prompt?
This interactive prompt happens because:
1. GPG couldn't find a public key matching `recipient@example.com` in your keyring (in the custom homedir).
2. The `-r` flag is provided, but it doesn't resolve to a valid key, so GPG falls back to asking you to enter the user ID manually.

The prompt is:
```
Current recipients:
Enter the user ID.  End with an empty line:
```

- **User ID** means the recipient's full identifier, like `John Doe <recipient@example.com>` or their key fingerprint/ID (e.g., `ABCDEF123456`).
- Enter it line-by-line if needed (e.g., name, email, comment), then hit Enter twice (empty line) to finish.

#### How to Fix This
1. **Import the recipient's public key first** (most common issue):
   - Ask the recipient to send you their public key (exported via `gpg --export -a their@email.com`).
   - Import it: `gpg --homedir /path/to/custom/dir --import their-public-key.asc`.
   - Then re-run your command.

2. **If the key is already imported but not matching**:
   - List keys: `gpg --homedir /path/to/custom/dir --list-keys`.
   - Use the exact user ID from there in `-r` (e.g., `-r "John Doe <recipient@example.com>"`).

3. **At the prompt** (as a quick workaround):
   - Type the full user ID, e.g.:
     ```
     John Doe
     recipient@example.com
     
     ```
     (Empty line ends it.)

#### Why "Recipient" Instead of "Sender"?
- Encryption is *asymmetric*: Public key (anyone can encrypt) → Private key (only owner decrypts).
- Sender (you) encrypts with recipient's **public** key.
- If you want to prove you're the sender, add signing: `gpg ... -e -r recipient@example.com -s --encrypt inputfile.txt` (uses *your* private key to sign).
- "Recipient" is standard GPG lingo—it's not about who sends, but who receives/decrypts. Calling it "sender" would confuse things, as senders don't need a key for encryption (only for signing).

If this doesn't resolve it, share the output of `--list-keys` (redact sensitive info), and I can help debug!
