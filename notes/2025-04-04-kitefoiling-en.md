Since you asked about "how to do kitefoiling" after mentioning Max Maeder, a kitefoiling champion, I’ll provide a detailed beginner’s guide to learning this sport. Kitefoiling (also called kiteboard foiling or wing foiling in some contexts) combines kiteboarding and hydrofoiling, where you ride a board equipped with a hydrofoil wing that lifts it above the water, controlled by an inflatable kite. It’s fast, technical, and thrilling—Max Maeder’s dominance at age 18 shows its potential for mastery with practice. Here’s how to get started.

### How to Kitefoil: A Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Understand the Basics
- **What It Is**: You use a kite (inflatable, tethered by lines) to harness wind power, steering it to propel a board with a hydrofoil (a fin-like structure) that lifts you above the water, reducing drag for smooth, fast rides.
- **Why It’s Unique**: Unlike surfing, it’s wind-driven, not wave-driven, and the foil allows gliding even in light winds (8–15 knots).

#### 2. Gather the Right Gear
- **Kite**: Start with a trainer kite (2–4m²) to learn control, then a foil-specific kite (6–12m², depending on wind and your weight). Leading-edge inflatable (LEI) kites are common for beginners.
- **Board**: Use a foilboard—wider and shorter than regular kiteboards (e.g., 130–150 cm long, 45–50 cm wide) for stability. Beginners often start with larger boards.
- **Hydrofoil**: A mast (60–90 cm) with front and rear wings. Shorter masts (e.g., 60 cm) are easier for learning as they’re less wobbly.
- **Harness**: A waist or seat harness connects you to the kite via lines, taking strain off your arms.
- **Safety Gear**: Helmet, life jacket, wetsuit (for warmth/protection), and a leash to keep the board close.
- **Bar and Lines**: The control bar (with 20–25m lines) steers the kite and manages power.

#### 3. Learn Kite Control (On Land First)
- **Trainer Kite Practice**: On a beach or open field, fly a small trainer kite:
  - **Wind Window**: Imagine a quarter-sphere in front of you. The kite’s power peaks at 12 o’clock (straight up) and drops at 3 or 9 o’clock (sides).
  - **Steering**: Pull left or right on the bar to turn the kite. Practice figure-eights and parking it at neutral positions (11 or 1 o’clock).
  - **Power Strokes**: Dive the kite through the power zone (12 o’clock) to feel the pull, then return it to neutral.
- **Safety**: Learn to release the kite (via quick-release systems) if overwhelmed.

#### 4. Start in the Water (Body Dragging)
- **Setup**: Launch your full-sized kite with an instructor or helper in shallow water (waist-deep). Wear your harness and leash but leave the board aside.
- **Body Drag**: Let the kite pull you through the water without a board:
  - Dive the kite left (9 o’clock) to go left, right (3 o’clock) to go right, or loop it for continuous pull.
  - Practice recovering the board by steering the kite to drag you toward it (a key skill if you fall later).
- **Goal**: Master kite control in water before adding the board.

#### 5. Ride with the Board (No Foil Yet)
- **Start on a Regular Kiteboard**: Use a standard kiteboard (not a foilboard) to learn basic riding:
  - **Water Start**: Sit in the water, board on your feet, kite at 12 o’clock. Dive it sharply (e.g., to 2 o’clock) to pull you up. Lean back, point the board downwind, and stand.
  - **Riding**: Keep the kite at 11 or 1 o’clock for steady power, knees bent, weight on your heels. Look where you’re going.
  - **Turning**: Shift weight to toes or heels and steer the kite to change direction.
- **Why No Foil?**: Foiling adds instability—nail regular kiteboarding first.

#### 6. Transition to Foiling
- **Mount the Foil**: Switch to your foilboard. The hydrofoil attaches under the board via a mast.
- **First Attempts**:
  - Start in light wind (8–12 knots) and flat water for control.
  - Water-start as before, but once moving, shift weight forward slightly to lift the board. The foil will rise when you hit 5–7 knots.
  - Stay low, knees bent, and avoid overcorrecting—small movements control the foil’s height.
- **Riding the Foil**: 
  - Keep the kite at a steady angle (e.g., 11 o’clock) for consistent pull.
  - Use front-foot pressure to rise higher, back-foot pressure to descend. Too much lift? You’ll breach (board jumps out); too little, you’ll sink.
  - Aim for smooth, quiet gliding—that’s the sweet spot.
- **Turning**: Lean into turns gently, steering the kite to match. Sharp moves can stall the foil.

#### 7. Refine and Progress
- **Speed**: As you improve, foil in stronger winds (15–20 knots) for Max Maeder-level speeds (up to 40 knots in races).
- **Jumps**: Pull the kite up sharply while lifting the board for airtime—foils make jumps smoother than regular kiteboards.
- **Tacking/Jibing**: Practice upwind/downwind turns, critical for racing or long-distance foiling.

### Tips for Success
- **Take Lessons**: Kitefoiling’s learning curve is steep. A 2–3 day course (e.g., from IKO-certified schools) covers kite control, safety, and foiling basics. In Singapore, try Kiteboarding Singapore or nearby Bali schools.
- **Fitness**: Core strength, balance, and endurance (for long sessions) are key. Max Maeder’s chess-playing focus hints at the mental stamina needed too.
- **Wind**: Ideal range is 10–20 knots. Too little, and you won’t lift; too much, and it’s hard to control.
- **Practice**: Expect 10–20 hours to ride consistently, more for advanced moves.

### Safety Considerations
- **Avoid Crowds**: Foils are sharp—stay clear of swimmers or other kiters.
- **Weather**: Check forecasts; avoid storms or offshore winds that push you out to sea.
- **Crash Protocol**: If you fall, release the kite if tangled, protect your head, and swim away from the board to avoid the foil.

### Max Maeder’s Influence
Max started kitefoiling at 10 and won his first pro race at 11, showing dedication pays off. His technique—precise kite control, foil mastery, and tactical racing—sets a high bar. Beginners won’t hit his level quickly, but his path (early start, coaching, relentless practice) is a roadmap.

### Getting Started in Singapore
Singapore’s flat waters (e.g., East Coast Park) and steady winds make it decent for learning, though Max trains globally for variety. Local clubs like Kitesurfing Association Singapore can hook you up with gear and lessons.
