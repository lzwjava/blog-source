Below is a realistic, evidence‑based estimate for **how many hours / months you’ll probably need to reach each major Japanese milestone**, taking into account:

* your native Chinese literacy (big kanji head‑start);
* proven self‑study discipline (competitive‑programming mindset, 300+ books read, 480 blog posts);
* prior success learning English to IELTS 6 and regular interaction with foreign teachers;
* heavy daily tech usage (AI tools, mobile “immersion” possibilities).

## 1. What the research says — baseline numbers

| JLPT level                | **Hours if you already know kanji** | **Hours if you don’t** | Source                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| N5                        | \~350 h                             | 400‑500 h              | ([Coto Japanese Academy][1]) |
| N4                        | \~550 h                             | 800‑1 000 h            | ([Coto Japanese Academy][1]) |
| N3                        | \~900 h                             | 1 325 h                | ([Coto Japanese Academy][1]) |
| N2                        | \~1 500 h                           | 2 200 h                | ([Coto Japanese Academy][1]) |
| **N1 (advanced fluency)** | **\~2 150 h**                       | 3 900‑4 500 h          | ([Coto Japanese Academy][1]) |

Other large‑scale studies line up:

* FSI lists Japanese among the “super‑hard” languages for English speakers at **2 200 class hours** (plus homework) ([Atlas & Boots][2]).
* Migaku aggregated data from Tokyo schools: **Chinese‑literate students needed 1 700‑2 600 h to clear N1** ([migaku.com][3]).
* A Reddit meta‑survey cites **≈2 000 h for kanji‑literate learners to reach solid N1/Near‑C1** ([Reddit][4]).

**Take‑away:** 1 500 h ⇒ upper‑intermediate (N2); 2 000‑2 600 h ⇒ advanced (N1) if you leverage your kanji advantage.

## 2. Adjusting for *your* profile

**Factors that work in your favour**

| Advantage                      | Impact                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Native Chinese reading**     | Kanji ≈ 1 500 characters already familiar; vocabulary recognition up to 50 %.                |
| **Algorithm‑training stamina** | You’ve already logged thousands of deliberate‑practice hours; language SRS suits this style. |
| **Tech ecosystem & AI tools**  | Instant grammar‑checking, sentence mining, GPT explanations shorten the feedback loop.       |
| **Content affinity**           | You already listen to Japanese music → daily passive listening “free hours.”                 |

**Factors that still need hours**

| Gap                                | Notes                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Grammar & syntax**               | Japanese word order, particles, honorific system need conscious practice.                  |
| **Listening speed & pitch accent** | Kanji knowledge doesn’t help your ears. Requires extensive audio time.                     |
| **Speaking / output**              | Pronunciation is simpler than English but demands muscle memory and pitch‑accent accuracy. |

**Reasonable efficiency gain for you:** \~20 % faster than the “average kanji user.”
So: **N2 ≈ 1 200 h, N1 ≈ 1 700‑2 000 h**.

## 3. Converting hours to a calendar

| Daily study time                                        | Reach N3 | Reach N2  | Reach N1   |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **1 h/day** (7 h/wk)                                    | \~15 mo  | \~2 ⅓ y   | \~4 y      |
| **2 h/day** (14 h/wk)                                   | \~8 mo   | \~15 mo   | \~2 ½ y    |
| **3–4 h/day** (20‑30 h/wk)                              | \~5‑6 mo | \~9‑12 mo | \~18‑22 mo |
| **Full‑immersion boot‑camp**<br>(5‑6 h/day, 35‑40 h/wk) | \~3‑4 mo | \~7‑8 mo  | \~12‑15 mo |

*These spans assume consistent, focused practice (see next section).*

## 4. High‑leverage study plan

1. **Foundations (first 100 h)**

   * Hiragana + Katakana (10 h)
   * Tae Kim or Cure Dolly for core grammar (40 h)
   * Start Anki deck with JLPT N5 vocab & pitch‑accent (daily 20‑min reviews).

2. **Structured progression (to \~600 h)**

   * Textbook pipeline: *Genki I → Genki II → Quartet I*.
   * Shadow native audio daily (music lyrics + easy podcasts).
   * Write short tech dev‑logs in Japanese; feed them to GPT‑4o for corrections.

3. **Intermediate immersion (600‑1 200 h)**

   * Switch to **native** content aligned with your interests: tech blogs, anime OST lyrics, NHK News Easy, *日経テクノロジー* articles.
   * Language tool‑chain: Migaku/Yomichan + YouTube JP subtitles; auto‑sentence‑mining into Anki.
   * Weekly online 1‑on‑1 with italki teacher to drill speaking & business email formats.

4. **Advanced ramp‑up (1 200‑2 000 h)**

   * Read domain‑specific documents: Spring Boot docs in Japanese, AWS white‑papers, fintech regs.
   * Simulate workplace tasks: architecture write‑ups, code‑review comments, Jira tickets in Japanese.
   * JLPT mock exams every 6‑8 weeks; post‑mortem with error‑card creation.

5. **Maintenance & polish**

   * Join Japanese OSS projects for pull‑request discussions.
   * Present lightning talks (LT) at online JP developer meetups.
   * Keep a daily “小説自動生成” side‑project to refine stylistic nuance.

## 5. Key tips to shave additional months

| Tip                                        | Why it helps                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exploit kanji similarity intelligently** | Map unfamiliar Japanese readings to known Chinese meanings to boost vocab throughput.                               |
| **Track hours like a coding project**      | Use Toggl or Excel; data keeps motivation high.                                                                     |
| **Mix passive + active**                   | Listen to Japanese podcasts while commuting; active SRS during focused blocks.                                      |
| **Automate everything**                    | Script YouTube subtitle extraction + GPT glossaries; integrate with your existing personal‑knowledge‑base workflow. |
| **Deliberate speaking drills**             | 10‑minute daily “shadow‑loop” (listen‑repeat‑record‑compare) fixes pronunciation early.                             |

### Bottom‑line forecast

* **Casual pace (≈1 h/day):** N2 in 2‑3 years; N1 in \~4 years.
* **Moderate commitment (2‑3 h/day):** N2 in \~1 year; N1 in \~2 years.
* **Boot‑camp intensity (5 h/day for a few months, then 2‑3 h/day):** Possible to hit N1 inside 18 months.

Given your proven self‑learning stamina and kanji advantage, the **moderate path** is very realistic alongside full‑time work. If you treat it like an algorithmic side‑project—daily commits, automated tests (mock exams), and continuous integration with AI assistants—you’ll stay on schedule without burnout.
