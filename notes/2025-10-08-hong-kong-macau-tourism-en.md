Yes, for Mainland China residents applying for HK and Macau endorsements (港澳签注) on the Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao (commonly called the "Home Return Permit"), the options for personal tourism (G-type visa) include shorter single-entry versions like 3 months single or 1 year single, alongside double-entry (up to twice) or multiple-entry options where available. Most people do indeed prefer the longer or multiple-entry ones for convenience, as they allow more flexibility without needing to reapply as often—especially the 1-year multiple-entry endorsement in eligible pilot cities (like Guangzhou), which has no entry limit within the year and costs just 80 RMB.

### Quick Breakdown of Tourism Endorsement Options (Personal/G-Type):
- **Hong Kong**:
  - 3 months single: Valid for 3 months, 1 entry, stay ≤7 days per visit.
  - 3 months double: Valid for 3 months, 2 entries, stay ≤7 days per visit.
  - 1 year single: Valid for 1 year, 1 entry, stay ≤7 days.
  - 1 year double: Valid for 1 year, 2 entries, stay ≤7 days.
  - 1 year multiple (pilot cities only): Valid for 1 year, unlimited entries, stay ≤7 days— this is the popular choice.
- **Macau**:
  - 3 months single: Valid for 3 months, 1 entry, stay ≤7 days.
  - 1 year single: Valid for 1 year, 1 entry, stay ≤7 days.
  - (No double or multiple options for Macau tourism.)

Fees are low: 15 RMB for single-entry, 30 RMB for double-entry, 80 RMB for short-term multiple.

Regarding the 3-month single-entry option: Yes, you can absolutely apply for it multiple times—there's no limit on how often you reapply as long as your Home Return Permit is valid and you meet the eligibility (e.g., resident in an approved city like Guangzhou). Once it expires (or after you've used the single entry), just head back to a police station self-service machine or exit-entry office for a new one. It's common for people to do this if they only travel infrequently or prefer the cheaper fee. No waiting periods or cooldowns are required.

If you're in Guangzhou, the self-service machines at local police stations handle these renewals instantly for eligible locals.
