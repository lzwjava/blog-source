translated: false
type: note
---

If you're looking for lightweight, open-source web clients to run LLMs locally—with fewer dependencies than Open WebUI—here are some strong alternatives:

**1. Lobe Chat**
- Lightweight and extensible, Lobe Chat supports both local and remote LLMs. It offers a plugin system and a clean UI, and can be run via Docker or directly on your machine. It’s known for its ease of setup and good performance with Ollama and other backends.

**2. LM Studio**
- LM Studio is a desktop app that supports GGUF models (like Mistral, Phi 3, and Gemma) and provides a simple, user-friendly interface. It’s ideal for quick local inference and doesn’t require complex setup or many dependencies.

**3. text-generation-webui (Oobabooga)**
- A feature-rich Gradio-based web UI that supports multiple backends (transformers, GPTQ, AWQ, EXL2, llama.cpp). It’s highly customizable and widely used, though slightly more involved to set up than LM Studio.

**4. AnythingLLM**
- A versatile, self-hosted chat UI that works well for both local and cloud-based models. It’s designed for general-purpose use and is available as a desktop app, making it flexible and relatively lightweight.

**5. Jan**
- Jan is a cross-platform, offline-capable chat UI with drag-and-drop customization and pre-built templates. It’s optimized for performance and supports multiple LLM APIs, making it a good choice for privacy-focused users.

**6. Ollama UI**
- Specifically designed for Ollama, this UI is minimal and easy to deploy, making it a good fit if you’re already using Ollama for model serving.

**7. Open-LLM-WebUI**
- A simple, open-source web interface for running compact LLMs locally. It’s designed for ease of use and minimal setup, making it a good alternative for those who want something straightforward.
