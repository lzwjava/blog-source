I get it—building meaningful connections with people who vibe on the same wavelength, especially niche stuff like self-taught deep dives into algorithms, AI experimentation, or reversing myopia through natural methods, can feel isolating. Guangzhou's tech scene is buzzing but competitive, and those "unpopular, very hard-to-find" academic angles? Yeah, they're rare gems. The good news is your blog (with those 400 posts and 60k views) is already a magnet—it's proof you're putting yourself out there, and commenters or readers who engage deeply could turn into collaborators or friends. Keep leaning into that; maybe even cross-post snippets to platforms like X or Reddit to draw in more like-minded folks.

Focusing on "now and future" as you said, here's a practical playbook to scout and connect with people sharing your tech depth, entrepreneurial hacks, AI autonomy, or vision research. I'll prioritize online spots (easy entry) and local Guangzhou options (for real-world sparks), emphasizing niches that align with your profile. Start small: Pick one interest, join a thread or event, and share a bit from your GitHub/portfolio/blog to spark convos.

### Online Communities for Niche Tech & AI Enthusiasts
These are global but with strong China/Asia ties—great for async chats on full-stack experiments, distributed systems, or using AI as an "autonomous agent" like you do.

- **Cloud Native Guangzhou (CNCF Community)**: A developer-focused group on cloud tech, containers, and microservices (your Alibaba/AWS/Azure wheelhouse). They host talks and hack sessions; jump in via their Slack or forums to discuss real-world logging/testing setups. Active with passionate devs who geek out on future-proof architectures.
  
- **Reddit's r/MachineLearning and r/LearnMachineLearning**: Dive into threads on big data tools or self-taught ML paths. Your 1 year in ML + 1000+ algo problems? Post about your freelance experiments or AI logging hacks—folks here love niche "how I built X" stories. Bonus: Search for "China AI self-study" for local angles.

- **EndMyopia Forum (from endmyopia.org)**: Perfect for your 3-year myopia reversal research. It's a tight-knit community sharing experiments inspired by Todd Becker and similar (Yin Wang vibes too). Post your academic-style papers or gadget hacks (like EMF meters for eye strain?); they've got success stories from high-myopia reversals and ongoing trials. Super niche, low noise—ideal for deep bonds.

- **Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com)**: For your entrepreneurial/product mindset. Comment on threads about open-source mobile dev or life-hacking apps (your 500+ apps tested?). It's full of self-taught engineers debating future tech; flag your GitHub projects to attract collab invites.

For AI tools specifically in China: Look into "AI night schools" popping up in Guangdong—informal groups teaching prompt engineering and toolchains. They're grassroots, with enthusiasts like you experimenting daily. Search WeChat for "AI工具夜校广州" to join one; it's booming for future-oriented hackers.

### Guangzhou/Local Spots to Meet in Person
Leverage your road-trip energy—hit these for face-to-face chats on algorithms, startups, or even travel-life hacks. Many are monthly, so scout upcoming dates.

| Event/Group | Focus | Why It Fits You | Next Steps |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| **Startup Grind Guangzhou** | Entrepreneurship, tech talks | Product mindset + your 11 years exp; share freelance stories or app experiments. Virtual option Oct 11, 2025. | RSVP free on their site; pitch a "life-hacking with AI" lightning talk. |
| **IT & Science/Tech Meetups on Eventbrite** | Coding, cloud, AI workshops | Full-stack/mobile devs; discuss Spring Boot/Redis or your 10 OSS projects. Multiple events monthly. | Filter for "Guangzhou IT" on Eventbrite; attend one this month. |
| **Networking Groups on Meetup.com** | Professional tech networking | Connect with Guangdong NOIP alums or self-taught folks; your Beijing dropout-to-freelancer arc resonates. | Join "Guangzhou Tech Networking"—events like casual code shares. |
| **IEEE Power Conversion & Control Engineering Conf (PCCE 2025)** | Engineering, distributed systems | Backend/distributed systems deep dives; network on Alibaba Cloud modules. Nov 14, 2025. | Register early; present on your microservices logging. |
| **Guangzhou-HK-Taipei AI Workshop** | AI communications, theory | Your AI reading (2000+ answers) + tools proficiency; niche academic talks on unsolved problems. | Submit abstract from your vision papers—it's regional. |

### Quick Tips to Turn Connections into Friends
- **Niche Icebreakers**: Lead with your unique angles, e.g., "I've logged 3 years of myopia experiments—anyone tweaking Bates-inspired protocols with AI tracking?" It filters for the curious.
- **Your Assets as Hooks**: Link your blog/GitHub in intros. For vision stuff, share a paper snippet on the EndMyopia forum; for tech, fork a repo and tag collaborators.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Online first (low barrier), then local. Travel hack: Use your multi-phone setup to join virtual meetups while road-tripping to HK/Macao for broader nets.
- **Sustain It**: Like your generous sharing, follow up with value—fix a grammar tweak or suggest a book from your 320+. Aim for 1-2 interactions/week to build momentum.

You're already ahead with that knowledge-sharing habit and experimental spirit—friends will gravitate once you plant those seeds in the right soils. If a specific niche (e.g., more on vision or Android hacks) clicks, hit me with details for tailored hunts. What's one interest you're itching to geek out on first?
