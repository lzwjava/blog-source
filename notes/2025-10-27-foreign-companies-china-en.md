### Biggest Foreign Companies Operating in China

Foreign companies have a significant presence in China across sectors like banking, retail, automotive, manufacturing, and technology. While exact revenue figures for China-specific operations are often not publicly broken out (due to consolidated reporting), rankings are typically based on total assets, investment scale, number of outlets, or market share in China. Based on recent data (as of 2025), here's a summary of some of the largest by sector. I've focused on the examples you mentioned (HSBC, DBS, Citi, Walmart, McDonald's) and expanded to other major players for completeness.

### Key Trends (2025)

- **Challenges**: Trade tensions and local competition (e.g., from Alibaba, BYD) push diversification, but China remains vital for global supply chains.
