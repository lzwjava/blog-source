Robin Milner (1934-2010) was an influential English computer scientist, best known for his foundational contributions to programming languages, automatic theorem provers, and concurrency theory. He was awarded the prestigious A.M. Turing Award in 1991, often referred to as the "Nobel Prize of Computing," for these "three distinct and complete achievements."

Milner's key contributions include:

* **Logic for Computable Functions (LCF):** This was a pioneering interactive system for automatic theorem proving. Unlike previous approaches where computers would search for proofs, Milner's LCF provided a tool to *assist* researchers in formulating proofs, demonstrating a pragmatic blend of theory and practice.
* **ML (MetaLanguage) Programming Language:** Developed for implementing an automatic theorem solver within LCF, ML evolved into a powerful general-purpose programming language. It introduced innovative concepts such as polymorphic type inference (which automatically assigns data types) and type-safe exception handling, profoundly influencing the design of many modern programming languages like F# and OCaml.
* **Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS):** This was Milner's first major contribution to concurrency theory. CCS is a process calculus, a formal language used to describe concurrent systems, particularly focusing on indivisible communications between two participants. It provided a mathematical framework for analyzing the qualitative correctness of concurrent systems, such as detecting deadlocks or livelocks.
* **Pi-Calculus:** Building on CCS, Milner later developed the pi-calculus, a more general theory of concurrency that incorporated the mobility of communication links, allowing processes to communicate the names of communication channels themselves.
* **Bigraphs:** In his later career, Milner also worked on bigraphs, a formalism for ubiquitous computing that aimed to subsume CCS and the pi-calculus, further extending computation theory towards a foundation for ubiquitous and mobile informatic structures.

Milner's work was characterized by his ability to combine deep mathematical insights with a keen understanding of practical engineering issues, bridging the gap between theoretical foundations and real-world applications in computer science. He held academic positions at City University London, University of Wales, Swansea, Stanford University, and most notably, the University of Edinburgh, where he helped establish the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS). He later became head of the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. His profound impact on the field of computer science continues to be recognized through awards such as the Turing Award and the Robin Milner Young Researcher Award established in his honor.
