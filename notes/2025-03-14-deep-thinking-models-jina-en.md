Here's a breakdown of deep reasoning models and their API availability, designed to provide a deeper understanding and help you choose the right model for your needs:

*   **OpenAI o-series models (o1, o3-mini, etc.)**: These models, available through Azure OpenAI Service [^1], are designed for complex reasoning, excelling in science, coding, and math. The `o1` model, for instance, features a 200,000-token context window and can be fine-tuned with the `reasoning_effort` parameter to adjust processing time [^2].

    *   **API Access:** Accessible via Azure OpenAI Service API with the `2024-12-01-preview` API version [^1].
    *   **Pricing:** Azure OpenAI pricing varies based on the model and usage. Check the Azure OpenAI Service pricing page for detailed information.
    *   **Rate Limits:** Rate limits depend on the Azure OpenAI tier and region. Refer to Azure OpenAI documentation for specifics.
    *   **Supported Features:** Function calling, JSON mode, adjustable safety settings [^3].
    *   **Code Example (Python):**
        ```python
        from openai import AzureOpenAI
        client = AzureOpenAI(
          azure_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
          api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
          api_version="2024-12-01-preview"
        )
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="o1-new", # replace with the model deployment name of your o1 deployment.
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": "What steps should I think about when writing my first Python API?"},
            ],
            max_completion_tokens = 5000
        )
        print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
        ```
*   **DeepSeek R1**: Known for rivaling OpenAI's o1 in reasoning benchmarks, DeepSeek offers its R1 model via API [^4]. The API provides access to the Chain of Thought (CoT) content generated by the model, allowing users to observe the model's reasoning process [^5]. DeepSeek also provides a cost-effective alternative to OpenAI, with its complete R1 API offered at a fraction of the cost [^6]. The DeepSeek-V3 API is also available, with performance on par with leading closed-source models [^7].

    *   **API Access:** DeepSeek API, compatible with OpenAI API format [^8].
    *   **Pricing:** Input tokens \$0.14 per 1M tokens, Output tokens \$0.55 per 1M tokens [^9].
    *   **Rate Limits:** Refer to DeepSeek API documentation for specific rate limits.
    *   **Supported Features:** Chat Completion, Chat Prefix Completion (Beta) [^10].
    *   **Code Example (Python):**
        ```python
        from openai import OpenAI
        client = OpenAI(api_key="<DeepSeek API Key>", base_url="https://api.deepseek.com")
        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "9.11 and 9.8, which is greater?"}]
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="deepseek-reasoner",
            messages=messages
        )
        print(response.choices[^0].message.content)
        ```
        
*   **Grok (xAI)**: xAI's Grok models, including Grok-3 and Grok-3 mini, are designed with strong reasoning capabilities. While Grok-1.5 was available to early testers, Grok 3 is coming soon via API [^11]. Grok 3 (Think) and Grok 3 mini (Think) models were trained using reinforcement learning to refine its chain-of-thought process, enabling advanced reasoning in a data-efficient manner [^12].

    *   **API Access:** Grok 3 API is anticipated to be released soon [^11].
    *   **Pricing:** Pricing details are not yet publicly available. Check xAI's website for updates.
    *   **Rate Limits:** Rate limits are not yet publicly available. Check xAI's website for updates.
    *   **Supported Features:** Tool use, code execution, and advanced agent capabilities are planned for the Enterprise API [^12].
*   **Gemini 1.5 Pro**: As a Google model, Gemini 1.5 Pro excels at reasoning across large amounts of information and is optimized for a wide range of reasoning tasks [^13]. It's a multimodal model and provides stronger reasoning capabilities, including the thinking process in responses [^14]. The Gemini API gives developers access to a 2 million context window [^15].

    *   **API Access:** Available through the Gemini API [^15].
    *   **Pricing:** Check the Google AI Studio pricing page for detailed information.
    *   **Rate Limits:** 1,500 requests per minute for text embedding [^16]. Check the Google AI Studio documentation for other rate limits.
    *   **Supported Features:** Function calling, code execution, adjustable safety settings, JSON mode [^17].
