title: Fixing Dry Vietnamese Noodle Soup

---

It sounds like you're trying to recreate a Vietnamese noodle soup (I'm guessing Bún Riêu based on the tomato-heavy broth and soupy style—let me know if that's off!), but it ended up too dry after absorbing all the water. That's common if the noodles soak up the liquid without enough ongoing broth or if it simmers too long. Next time, try cooking the noodles separately, then adding them to a richer, ongoing simmered broth right before serving to keep it saucy. Don't let it sit post-cook.

For ingredients to make it closer to a restaurant-style Bún Riêu (tangy, umami-packed tomato broth with seafood vibes), here's what you can add beyond noodles and tomato. Focus on proteins and aromatics for depth—these build flavor without drying it out:

### Key Additions for Broth and Texture:
- **Crab paste or crab meat (essential for authenticity)**: 1-2 tbsp crab paste (or fresh crab claws/legs) stirred into the simmering tomato water. It adds that signature briny, slightly sweet seafood note.
- **Fried tofu puffs**: 4-6 pieces, sliced and added mid-cook. They soak up broth without falling apart and give chewy bites.
- **Shrimp or ground pork**: 100-200g peeled shrimp (quick-sauté first) or pork mince formed into small patties. Fry lightly, then simmer in the broth for 5-10 mins.
- **Quail eggs**: 4-6 hard-boiled, peeled, and halved. They add richness and are a classic topping.

### Veggies and Fresh Toppings (for crunch and balance):
- **Bean sprouts**: A big handful, blanched quickly and added fresh on top. Keeps things crisp.
- **Scallions and cilantro**: Chopped green onions and a bunch of cilantro stirred in at the end, plus extra for garnish.
- **Lime wedges and chili**: Squeeze fresh lime over each bowl for acidity (cuts the richness), and sliced fresh chilies or chili oil for heat.

### Quick Broth Boost:
- If your base water isn't flavorful enough, simmer with 1-2 tbsp fish sauce, a dash of sugar, and minced garlic/onion for 10 mins before adding noodles. Use chicken or pork bone broth instead of plain water next time for more body.

Start with smaller amounts to test—aim for a loose, soupy consistency. Total cook time: 20-30 mins on low heat. If this isn't Bún Riêu, describe the restaurant version more (e.g., what proteins or flavors stand out?) and I can refine!
