The CN1 cable, also known as the China-US Cable Network (CUCN), is a major submarine fiber-optic cable system designed to carry international internet traffic directly between China and the United States. It was the first direct cable system linking the two countries and also connects several other Asia-Pacific regions, including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Guam. The CN1 cable was put into service in early 2000 and was, at the time, the largest trans-pacific subsea cable system, with a total capacity of 80 Gbps and self-healing ring protection for reliability.

This cable is part of China’s broader strategy to ensure robust, high-capacity international connectivity for both commercial and strategic purposes, supporting the flow of data between China and overseas destinations, especially the US and other Asia-Pacific countries.
