### **His Story: A Journey of Perseverance**

1. **Early Life and Education**  
   - Born in 1955 in Shanghai, China, Zhang faced significant challenges during the Cultural Revolution, including being sent to rural labor camps. Despite this, he developed a deep love for mathematics.
   - He later studied at Peking University (B.S. in 1982) and pursued a Ph.D. at Purdue University in the U.S., focusing on algebraic geometry.

2. **Struggles in Academia**  
   - After completing his Ph.D., Zhang struggled to secure a stable academic position due to personal and professional setbacks, including a lack of strong recommendation letters.
   - For years, he worked outside academia—cooking in a sandwich shop, working at a motel, and even doing accounting jobs—while continuing to think deeply about mathematics.

3. **Breakthrough in Number Theory (2013)**  
   - In 2013, at age 58, Zhang published a landmark paper titled *"Bounded Gaps Between Primes"* in the *Annals of Mathematics*, one of the most prestigious journals in the field.
   - He proved a major result related to the **Twin Prime Conjecture**, showing that there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by no more than a finite number (specifically, less than 70 million). This was the first time such a bound had been established.
   - His work shocked the mathematical community and earned him immediate recognition, including the **MacArthur Fellowship ("Genius Grant")**, the **Cole Prize**, and numerous invitations to speak at top universities.

4. **Later Career**  
   - After his breakthrough, Zhang joined the faculty at the University of New Hampshire as a full professor.
   - He continues to work on number theory and other areas of mathematics, although his 2013 result remains his most celebrated achievement.

### **What We Can Learn from Yitang Zhang**

#### 1. **Perseverance Pays Off**
   - Zhang’s life shows that setbacks and delays do not define your future. He continued to pursue mathematics despite financial hardship, obscurity, and career roadblocks.
   - His story reminds us that it's never too late to make a significant impact.

#### 2. **Passion Over Recognition**
   - Zhang loved mathematics for its own sake—not for fame or prestige. Even during his "lost" years, he kept reading and thinking about math problems.
   - True intellectual passion can sustain you through difficult times.

#### 3. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - Before 2013, Zhang had published very few papers. Yet, with one single paper, he changed the course of number theory.
   - This teaches us that deep, focused work—even if unrecognized at first—can lead to transformative discoveries.

#### 4. **Stay Grounded and Humble**
   - Despite his success, Zhang has remained humble and private. He is known for avoiding media attention and sticking to his quiet, thoughtful ways.
   - Success doesn’t require ego; often, humility and discipline are better allies.

#### 5. **Believe in Your Potential**
   - Zhang’s story is proof that brilliance can emerge from anywhere—even from someone without elite connections or early career success.
   - You don’t need perfect conditions to produce great work.
