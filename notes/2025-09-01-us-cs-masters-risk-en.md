You’re right to step back and ask *why* a Chinese engineer like you would want to pursue a U.S. CS master’s between 2025 and 2030, especially given your rich background and the current global context. Let me frame it for you in layers:

---

## 1. The Broader Context (2025–2030)

* **China’s capability**: As you said, China can produce almost everything — from Apple-level products to advanced AI. Engineers inside China already have access to cutting-edge work.
* **Global AI & open source**: The world is trending open. Even though tools like ChatGPT or Claude may block China/HK, skilled engineers with proxies aren’t truly locked out. Models and open-source frameworks (DeepSeek, HuggingFace, etc.) are democratizing access.
* **Geopolitics & mobility**: The U.S. still attracts students, but visa scrutiny, Proclamation 10043, and political tensions remain obstacles. At the same time, countries like Singapore, Canada, Germany, and Australia are becoming attractive alternatives.

## 2. Why Consider a U.S. Master’s (For You Personally)

Given your profile:

* **Credibility boost**: You already have 11 years’ experience, 10+ open-source projects, and corporate history at HSBC. A U.S. degree adds a globally recognized credential that smooths cross-border work opportunities.
* **Network access**: U.S. programs connect you directly to Silicon Valley recruiters, alumni networks, and startups. Even a mid-tier program (e.g., NEU, UTD, USC) can land you internship → job pipelines.
* **Research/innovation culture**: If you ever want to pivot deeper into machine learning/big data research, U.S. universities provide a structured environment and lab ecosystem.
* **Resume optics**: A degree can act as a shortcut when dealing with HR filters in global companies. Right now, your background is strong but unconventional (self-study, associate degree). A master’s would “normalize” it for employers.

---

## 3. Why You Might Not Need It

* **You already built credibility**: 60k blog views/year, 10 OSS projects, papers on vision science, 320+ books read — that’s an intellectual record. You’re not starting from scratch.
* **Cost vs benefit**: \$120k+ for tuition + living, plus opportunity cost of leaving work. For someone with your financial situation (China property downturn, current salary allowing occasional U.S. travel), the ROI is not straightforward.
* **Alternative global routes**: With your English and tech skills, you could do shorter-term certificates (Stanford online, MITx, DeepLearning.AI), or pursue EU/Singapore/Germany programs that are cheaper and less politically fraught.
* **Work-first path**: Many global companies (ByteDance, TikTok, Huawei, startups) already give international exposure. You may not need a U.S. degree to work with Americans/Europeans daily.

## 4. What Could Be Your “Reason” If You Decide to Go

If you apply, the narrative you’d frame is:

* **Career normalization**: “Despite an unconventional academic journey, I’ve built a strong professional and research track record. A U.S. master’s will formalize my credentials and expand my global opportunities.”
* **AI/global innovation focus**: “I want structured training in AI/ML systems to complement my full-stack engineering expertise.”
* **Bridge role**: “My long China-based experience plus a U.S. degree will let me bridge ecosystems (open-source, AI tools, East–West collaborations).”

---

## 5. Alternatives You Could Take Now

* **Travel-based exposure**: As you said, you can already visit India, Asia, Europe, or the U.S. occasionally. Conferences, workshops, and collaborations may give you 70% of the benefit of a master’s at 10% of the cost.
* **Global remote work**: With your OSS presence and portfolio, you can strengthen remote income streams (consulting, freelancing, startups) that don’t depend on a degree.
* **Hybrid credentialing**: Consider online master’s or low-cost EU programs to balance recognition + affordability.

✅ **Bottom line for you**:
You don’t *need* a U.S. CS master’s to validate your skills. You’ve already proven yourself. But if you want a global “stamp of credibility” and direct access to U.S. job networks, it could be worth it — especially if you view it as a *strategic investment in mobility and optics*, not as a technical education.

Do you want me to sketch out **a cost–benefit matrix of three paths** (U.S. master vs. Asia/Europe study vs. doubling down on OSS + remote/global projects), tailored to your situation? That might help you decide whether “going” is worth it.
