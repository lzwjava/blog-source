### Taiwanese Street Corn in the Air Fryer (Yùmǐ - Chinese Corn Style)

"Yùmǐ" (玉米) in Chinese refers to corn, and a popular way to prepare it is in the style of Taiwanese street corn—savory, crispy, and full of umami. This air fryer version mimics the night market vibe without the grill. It's quick (about 20 minutes total), vegetarian, and serves 3 as an appetizer or side.

#### Ingredients
- 3 ears of corn on the cob, husked and silked
- 1/2 cup Japanese mayonnaise (kewpie mayo works best for creaminess)
- 2 tbsp vegetarian oyster sauce (or regular if not vegetarian)
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp five-spice powder
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp red chili flakes (adjust for spice level)

#### Instructions
1. **Prep the sauce**: In a small bowl, whisk together the Japanese mayo, vegetarian oyster sauce, garlic powder, five-spice powder, black pepper, and red chili flakes until smooth and well combined.

2. **Coat the corn**: Brush or slather the corn evenly with a generous layer of the sauce mixture. Make sure it's fully covered for that crispy exterior.

3. **Air fry**: Preheat your air fryer to 380°F (190°C) if your model requires it. Place the corn in the basket in a single layer (work in batches if needed). Air fry for 18-20 minutes, flipping halfway through with tongs. The corn should be tender inside with charred, crispy spots on the outside.

4. **Serve**: Let it cool slightly, then enjoy hot. Optional: Garnish with extra chili flakes or chopped scallions for more color and crunch.

#### Tips
- If your corn is extra large, add 2-3 minutes to the cook time.
- No air fryer? Bake at 380°F for 25 minutes, flipping halfway, or grill plain corn for 10-12 minutes then baste with sauce in the last few minutes.
- Customize: Add sacha sauce for earthiness, hot sauce for heat, or a pat of butter for richness. This base sauce is versatile and super addictive!

This method keeps the corn juicy while the sauce caramelizes beautifully in the air fryer. Perfect for summer barbecues or a quick snack.
