### Parking Fees in Xi'an, China

Parking fees in Xi'an (a major city in Shaanxi Province) vary depending on the location, type of parking (street, garage, mall, or airport), and time of day. As of my last knowledge update in 2023, here's a general overview based on typical rates—note that prices can fluctuate due to local regulations, inflation, or peak seasons (e.g., during festivals like the Spring Festival). Always check current rates via local apps like Alipay, WeChat Pay, or the Xi'an municipal traffic app for the most accurate info.

#### 1. **Street Parking (Roadside)**
   - **Common Rates**: 2–5 RMB (about 0.28–0.70 USD) per hour in urban areas like the city center (e.g., around Bell Tower, Drum Tower, or Muslim Quarter).
   - **Details**: 
     - Daytime (7 AM–9 PM): Often metered or app-based; free for the first 15–30 minutes in some spots.
     - Overnight (9 PM–7 AM): May be 1–2 RMB per hour or a flat fee of 5–10 RMB for the night.
     - Restrictions: Many streets have time limits (e.g., 1–2 hours max) and enforced zones. Illegal parking can lead to fines of 50–200 RMB or towing.
   - **Tip**: Use electronic payment via QR codes at meters; cash is less common now.

#### 2. **Public Parking Lots/Garages**
   - **Common Rates**: 3–8 RMB per hour in central districts; higher in busy areas like near tourist sites or shopping malls (e.g., 5–10 RMB/hour in high-traffic zones).
   - **Examples**:
     - Near Terra Cotta Warriors or train station: Around 4–6 RMB/hour, with daily caps of 20–50 RMB.
     - Mall parking (e.g., at Xi'an Xidan or MixC): Often 2–5 RMB/hour, but free with shopping receipts (e.g., free for 1–2 hours if you spend a minimum amount).
   - **Long-Term/Overnight**: 10–30 RMB for 24 hours in most lots.

#### 3. **Airport Parking (Xi'an Xianyang International Airport)**
   - **Short-Term (0–2 hours)**: 10–15 RMB.
   - **Long-Term (per day)**: 20–50 RMB, depending on the lot (P1 for departures is pricier).
   - **Tip**: Book in advance via the airport app for discounts.

#### 4. **Other Factors**
   - **Peak Hours/Times**: Fees might double during rush hours (7–9 AM, 5–7 PM) or holidays.
   - **Electric Vehicles**: Some lots offer discounts (e.g., 20–50% off) with charging stations.
   - **Free Options**: Limited—some residential areas or outer suburbs have free parking, but it's risky due to theft or towing. Public transport (metro, buses) is often cheaper for tourists.
   - **Enforcement**: Xi'an has strict traffic rules; use apps like Gaode Maps (Amap) or Baidu Maps to find spots and pay fees digitally.

For the latest details, I recommend:
- Downloading apps like **High German Map (Gaode Ditu)** or **Xi'an Smart City** app.
- Checking the official Xi'an traffic police website or WeChat mini-programs.
- If you're visiting, consider ride-hailing (Didi) or public transit to avoid hassle—Xi'an's metro is efficient and cheap (2–5 RMB per ride).

If you have more specifics (e.g., area or duration), I can refine this! Safe travels!
