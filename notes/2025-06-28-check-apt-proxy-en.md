title: Check APT Proxy Settings in Ubuntu
translated: false

To check if `apt` is using a proxy in Ubuntu, follow these steps:

1. **Check the APT configuration file**:
   - Open the APT configuration file located at `/etc/apt/apt.conf` or `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/` (files in this directory, like `70debconf` or `proxy.conf`, may contain proxy settings).
   - Use a command like:
     ```bash
     sudo cat /etc/apt/apt.conf
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     sudo grep -r Proxy /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/
     ```
   - Look for lines like:
     ```
     Acquire::http::Proxy "http://proxy-server:port";
     Acquire::https::Proxy "https://proxy-server:port";
     Acquire::ftp::Proxy "ftp://proxy-server:port";
     ```
     If these lines exist, `apt` is configured to use a proxy.

2. **Check environment variables**:
   - `apt` may use proxy settings defined in environment variables like `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, or `ftp_proxy`.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     env | grep -i proxy
     ```
   - If you see output like `http_proxy=http://proxy-server:port`, `apt` may be using these settings.

3. **Check system-wide proxy settings**:
   - If you’re using a desktop environment (e.g., GNOME), check the system proxy settings:
     - Go to *Settings > Network > Proxy* or similar, depending on your desktop environment.
     - These settings might apply to `apt` if no specific APT proxy is configured.

4. **Test APT with a command**:
   - Run an `apt` command and observe the behavior:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```
   - If `apt` connects through a proxy, you might see delays, specific error messages, or proxy-related logs. To debug further, use:
     ```bash
     sudo apt -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=yes update
     ```
     This provides verbose output, which may indicate proxy usage.

5. **Check for proxy in `/etc/environment`**:
   - Some systems define proxies in `/etc/environment`. Check with:
     ```bash
     cat /etc/environment
     ```
   - Look for lines like:
     ```
     http_proxy="http://proxy-server:port"
     ```

If none of these show proxy settings, `apt` is likely not using a proxy. For real-time confirmation, you can monitor network traffic with tools like `tcpdump` or `wireshark` to see if `apt` connections route through a proxy server.

If you need help analyzing specific output or setting up a proxy, let me know!
