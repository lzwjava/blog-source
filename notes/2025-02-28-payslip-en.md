### 1. **Gross Salary – Your Total Earnings**
The **gross salary** is your total earnings before any deductions are applied. It includes your base wage plus any additional allowances or bonuses. Here’s an example breakdown:

### 2. **Variable Pay – Flexible Earnings**
**Variable pay** covers earnings that can vary each month, such as performance bonuses or overtime. This section highlights how your efforts can boost your income. Common terms you might see include “Performance Bonus” or “Overtime Pay,” linking your work directly to additional rewards.

### 3. **Benefits and Insurance – Your Contributions**
This section lists deductions for mandatory benefits and insurance programs, which support your long-term security. Even if no amounts are deducted in a given month, recognizing these terms is key:

- **Housing Fund**: A savings scheme for housing costs.

### 4. **Personal Income Tax – Your Tax Obligation**
The **personal income tax** section details how much tax is deducted from your earnings. Here’s a hypothetical example:

- **Monthly Special Additional Deduction**: $200.00 – Extra deductions for expenses like education or housing.
- **Cumulative Special Additional Deduction for the Year**: $2,400.00 – Total deductions year-to-date.
- **Taxable Amount for the Month**: $2,700.00 – The income subject to tax this month.
- **Cumulative Taxable Amount for the Year**: $32,400.00 – Year-to-date taxable total.
- **Individual Income Tax**: $180.00 – The tax deducted this month.

These terms explain how your tax is calculated, helping you verify accuracy or address questions with payroll staff.

### 5. **Net Salary – Your Take-Home Pay**
The **net salary** is the amount you receive after all deductions. Using our example:

- **Gross Salary**: $2,900.00 (e.g., $2,000 + $250 + $500 + $150).
- **Deductions**: $180.00 (tax) + $70.00 (insurance contributions).
- **Net Salary**: $2,650.00.

Other potential deductions might include:

- **Property Deduction**: $0 – Fees for property-related costs.
- **Other Deductions**: $0 – Miscellaneous withholdings.

The formula is straightforward:

**Net Salary = Gross Salary – Benefits and Insurance – Personal Income Tax – Other Deductions**

This confirms your exact take-home pay.
