### Top 10 Universities for Tech Entrepreneurship (PitchBook 2025 Rankings)

Based on PitchBook's 2025 University Rankings, which measure entrepreneurial success by the number of undergraduate alumni who founded venture-backed startups (data from Jan. 1, 2014, to Sept. 1, 2025). This aligns with the context of Technion's strong performance in producing tech startup founders. Here's the top 10:

| 3    | Harvard University | 1,355 | $61.6B |
| 4    | University of Pennsylvania | 1,206 | $120.4B |
| 5    | Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) | 1,131 | $69.8B |
