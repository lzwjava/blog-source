Buddhist values stem from the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) and focus on achieving spiritual awakening and living ethically. The main values include:

- **The Four Noble Truths**: The foundation of Buddhism, these truths outline the nature of suffering (dukkha), its cause (craving), its cessation (nirvana), and the path to liberation (the Noble Eightfold Path).
- **The Noble Eightfold Path**: A guide to ethical and mindful living, consisting of:
  - Right View: Understanding reality and the Four Noble Truths.
  - Right Intention: Cultivating compassion and letting go of harmful desires.
  - Right Speech: Speaking truthfully, kindly, and constructively.
  - Right Action: Acting ethically, avoiding harm (e.g., no killing, stealing).
  - Right Livelihood: Earning a living in ways that don’t harm others.
  - Right Effort: Cultivating positive mental states and overcoming negativity.
  - Right Mindfulness: Staying aware of body, feelings, and thoughts.
  - Right Concentration: Developing deep meditative focus to attain wisdom.
- **Compassion (Karuna)**: Active empathy and kindness toward all beings, aiming to alleviate suffering (e.g., the bodhisattva ideal in Mahayana Buddhism, where one seeks enlightenment for the sake of others).
- **Loving-Kindness (Metta)**: Wishing well-being and happiness for oneself and others, practiced through meditation and daily interactions.
- **Non-Attachment**: Letting go of clinging to desires, possessions, or outcomes, recognizing impermanence (anicca) to reduce suffering.
- **Mindfulness (Sati)**: Cultivating present-moment awareness to understand reality clearly, often through meditation practices.
- **Wisdom (Prajna)**: Developing insight into the true nature of existence, including interdependence and the absence of a permanent self (anatta).
- **Ethical Conduct (Sila)**: Living by precepts like avoiding harm, lying, stealing, intoxication, and misconduct, fostering harmony and self-discipline.

These values are expressed differently across Buddhist traditions—Theravada emphasizes personal liberation, Mahayana focuses on universal compassion, and Vajrayana incorporates esoteric practices—but they share the goal of overcoming suffering and attaining enlightenment.
