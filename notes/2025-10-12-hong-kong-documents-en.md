As a mainland China resident traveling to Hong Kong, you need to prepare the following documents and items to ensure a smooth trip and entry:

### Essential Documents
1. **Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao**:
   - You must have a valid *Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao* with a Hong Kong endorsement (G-type for individual travel, L-type for group travel). Choose the endorsement type and validity based on your travel plans (single or multiple entries).
   - Application: Apply at your local or residential Public Security Bureau’s Exit-Entry Administration with your ID card, household registration (if applicable), and photos.
   - Note: Endorsements typically allow a 7-day stay; ensure the endorsement is valid for your travel dates.

2. **ID Card**:
   - While the travel permit is used for entering Hong Kong, your ID card may be required for mainland transportation (e.g., high-speed rail, flights) or hotel check-in.

3. **Hong Kong Arrival Card**:
   - You’ll need to fill out an arrival card upon entering Hong Kong, usually provided on flights or at border checkpoints, with personal details and trip purpose.

### Other Important Preparations
1. **Currency and Payment Methods**:
   - **Hong Kong Dollars (HKD)**: Carry a small amount of HKD cash (about HKD 500–1,000) for small expenses like transportation or street food. Some places accept RMB, but exchange rates may be unfavorable.
   - **Electronic Payments**: Hong Kong widely accepts Octopus cards (for public transport and small purchases), WeChat Pay, Alipay (ensure it’s set up for Hong Kong or linked to an international card), UnionPay, or Visa/Mastercard. Confirm your payment methods work in Hong Kong.
   - **Currency Exchange**: Exchange money at mainland banks or Hong Kong exchange counters; avoid airports or tourist areas for better rates.

2. **Transportation**:
   - **Octopus Card**: Highly recommended to purchase an Octopus card (available at MTR stations or convenience stores) for use on subways, buses, ferries, and in stores.
   - **Navigation Tools**: Download Google Maps or local apps like “MTR Mobile” for route planning.

3. **Communication and Internet**:
   - **SIM Card/Data**: Mainland phone plans may incur high roaming fees. Consider buying a Hong Kong SIM card (e.g., China Mobile Hong Kong, CSL, 3HK) with short-term data plans (e.g., 1–7 days unlimited data).
   - **Wi-Fi**: Free Wi-Fi is available in many malls, restaurants, and cafes, but coverage is limited, so having mobile data is advisable.

4. **Travel Itinerary**:
   - **Accommodation Confirmation**: Print or save electronic hotel booking confirmations, as they may be requested at entry.
   - **Itinerary Planning**: Plan visits to attractions (e.g., Victoria Harbour, Disneyland, Victoria Peak) and check transportation options in advance.
   - **Return Tickets**: Ensure you have booked return transportation, as proof of departure may be required at entry.

### Other Suggested Items
1. **Personal Items**:
   - Passport (if planning to travel from Hong Kong to other countries/regions).
   - Charger and power bank (Hong Kong uses UK-style three-pin sockets; bring a plug adapter).
   - Personal medications (common drugs are available in Hong Kong, but bring prescriptions for specific needs).
   - Light clothing (adjust for season; Hong Kong is humid, hot in summer, and cool in winter).

2. **Health Precautions (if applicable)**:
   - As of 2023, most COVID-19 restrictions in Hong Kong have been lifted, but check the latest entry policies for any health declarations or vaccine requirements.
   - Bring a few masks and sanitizers for public places if needed.

### Important Notes
- **Customs Regulations**:
   - Prohibited items include fresh food (e.g., fruits, meat) and restricted items (e.g., weapons, drugs). You can bring duty-free items for personal use (e.g., up to 19 cigarettes, 1 liter of alcohol).
   - When returning to the mainland, customs allows a duty-free shopping limit (usually RMB 5,000); excess may require tax declaration.
- **Language**: Cantonese and English are widely used in Hong Kong; Mandarin is generally understood, but some places may prefer Cantonese.
- **Safety**: Hong Kong is generally safe, but keep your documents and valuables secure, especially in crowded areas like Mong Kok or Tsim Sha Tsui.
