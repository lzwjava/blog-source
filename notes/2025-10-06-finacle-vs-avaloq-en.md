### Overview
Finacle and Avaloq are both comprehensive core banking platforms designed to handle end-to-end financial operations for banks and financial institutions. Finacle, developed by Infosys (through its EdgeVerve subsidiary), is a cloud-native solution emphasizing scalability, digital engagement, and global reach. Avaloq, now part of NEC Corporation, is a modular, front-to-back platform focused on wealth management, retail banking, and operational efficiency.
