### HSBC Global Career Band (GCB) System Overview

HSBC uses a standardized Global Career Band (GCB) framework to structure roles and career progression across its global operations. This system assigns a band number to every job, ranging from GCB 1 (top executives like C-suite and managing directors) to GCB 8 or 9 (entry-level positions). Lower numbers indicate higher seniority and responsibility. The bands ensure consistency in grading roles worldwide, regardless of location or business unit, but actual titles, responsibilities, and compensation can vary by region, experience, and department (e.g., investment banking vs. technology).

#### How the System Works
- **Role Assignment and Progression**: Jobs are evaluated and slotted into bands based on factors like scope, impact, leadership, and skills required. Employees start in lower-seniority bands (higher numbers) and progress by applying for and securing roles in higher-seniority bands (lower numbers). Promotions aren't automatic; they depend on performance, availability of openings, and internal mobility processes.
- **Performance and Development**: Annual reviews tie into the bands, influencing bonuses, raises, and promotions. High performers may accelerate within or out of a band, but the system emphasizes global mobility—employees can transfer roles across countries while retaining band alignment.
- **Middle Management Focus**: Bands 4 and 5 are often classified as "middle" levels, bridging junior and senior roles. They typically involve supervisory duties, project leadership, and specialized expertise.

#### Band 4 (GCB4): High and Low Ends
- **Typical Roles**: Vice President (VP), Senior Manager, Associate Director, or Lead Consultant. Focuses on managing teams, driving projects, and contributing to strategy.
- **Salary Ranges** (approximate total compensation, including base + bonus; varies by location and experience):
  - **Low End**: Entry into the band or less experienced roles—e.g., ₹30-45 LPA in India, £50k-£60k in the UK, $120k-$140k in the US.
  - **High End**: Seasoned professionals with strong performance—e.g., ₹50-60+ LPA in India, £80k-£100k+ in the UK, $180k-$220k in the US.
- **Key Notes**: Band 4 often requires 8-15+ years of experience. High-end pay rewards leadership and global impact.

#### Band 5 (GCB5): High and Low Ends
- **Typical Roles**: Assistant Vice President (AVP), Senior Business Analyst, Consultant Specialist, or Lead Associate. Involves individual contributions with some team oversight, like analysis, implementation, and stakeholder management.
- **Salary Ranges** (approximate total compensation):
  - **Low End**: Newer to the band—e.g., ₹13-20 LPA in India, £40k-£50k in the UK, $100k-$120k in the US.
  - **High End**: Experienced high performers—e.g., ₹25-35 LPA in India, £60k-£80k in the UK, $140k-$160k in the US.
- **Key Notes**: Suited for 5-10 years of experience. Progression to Band 4 is common for top performers.

These ranges are influenced by location (e.g., higher in high-cost areas like Hong Kong or New York), business line (e.g., tech vs. finance), and market conditions. For personalized advice, check HSBC's internal tools or consult HR during offers.
