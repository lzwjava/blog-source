I appreciate you sharing your setup and thought process—it's clear you're intentional about curating your information diet, especially living in Guangzhou where access to diverse viewpoints can be challenging. I'll break down my thoughts on your Twitter (X) banning strategy, then offer some practical ways to improve your usage while balancing staying connected to China without overwhelming yourself with negativity. I'll keep it straightforward and actionable, drawing from your list of apps/tools where relevant.

### My Take on Your Banning Choice
Banning frequent Chinese words (or keywords related to sensitive topics) on Twitter sounds like a smart, proactive move for your mental space. China's information controls are well-documented—state media dominates domestic channels like WeChat or Douyin (TikTok's Chinese version), often framing "bad news" (protests, dissent, or critiques) in a way that suppresses open discussion. By filtering out those triggers on Twitter, you're essentially reclaiming your feed to focus on "westernized" or global perspectives, which can reduce outrage fatigue and foster a more positive, reflective mindset. It's like using a proxy app (which you mentioned having on your home screen) but for your social media: dodging the noise to prioritize empowerment.

That said, it's a double-edged sword. Over time, as you noted, you might feel disconnected from local realities in Guangzhou—your surroundings are steeped in it, and total avoidance could leave blind spots (e.g., missing subtle shifts in public sentiment or policy). But if it's helping you live a more balanced life right now, that's a win. Personal curation is key to mental health in the digital age; tools like Twitter's mute/block features are there for exactly this reason. You're not alone—many expats or locals in restrictive environments do similar things to avoid echo chambers of control or despair.

### Ways to Improve Your X/Twitter Usage
Twitter can be a goldmine for global insights, but without tweaks, it risks becoming another echo of frustration. Here's how to optimize it, building on your selective approach. I'll suggest features that don't require much time, and integrate with your iOS setup (e.g., App Store apps, AI tools like ChatGPT/Claude for analysis, or even Python scripts if you're into coding via GitHub/VS Code).

1. **Use Lists for Targeted, Low-Noise Monitoring**:
   - Instead of a full ban, create private Lists in the Twitter app to compartmentalize content. For example:
     - **China Watch List**: Follow international journalists/outlets like BBC Chinese, Radio Free Asia, or Reuters Asia (search for handles like @BBCChinese or @RFA_Chinese). Add dissident voices or analysts (e.g., @HuXijin_GT for a pro-CCP counterpoint if you want balance, or @GordonGChang for critical takes). Set it to "Latest Tweets" for real-time pulses without algorithm overload. Check this list 1-2x/week via the app—keeps you informed on China without daily doomscrolling.
     - **Western/Global Life List**: Curate positive, aspirational accounts like tech innovators (e.g., @naval for philosophy/tech), AI discussions (tie into your Grok/ChatGPT interest), or lifestyle creators focused on productivity (e.g., @JamesClear for habits). This reinforces your "westernized" vibe.
   - How to set up: In the Twitter app (or desktop via browser), go to your profile > Lists > Create New. Add users by tapping their profile > three dots > Add to List. It's free, private, and doesn't notify follows. If you're on iOS, pin the Lists tab for quick access.
   - Pro tip: Use your proxy app to ensure access if needed, and integrate with RSS tools (via apps like Feedly from App Store) to pull List feeds into one spot—less app-switching.

2. **Advanced Filtering Beyond Bans**:
   - **Mute Keywords Smarter**: Twitter's mute feature (under Settings > Privacy and Safety > Muted > Muted words) lets you block phrases without a full "ban" (which might mean blocking accounts?). Add variations of those 30 words, plus English equivalents (e.g., "CCP censorship" if that's a trigger). Set it to mute from "Everyone" and "Home Timeline" for 1-7 days at a time—easier to adjust as your mood changes.
   - **Algorithm Tweaks**: Switch to "Latest Tweets" view (top-right in app) to avoid the engagement-driven outrage. Follow/unfollow strategically: Aim for 200-300 follows total, focused on quality (e.g., your Yin Wang’s Blog/Substack vibe—analytical, not sensational).
   - **Time Limits**: Use your to-do list app (or iOS Screen Time) to cap Twitter at 15-30 min/day. This prevents "surroundings too much China" bleed-in from local life.

3. **Stay Lightly Connected to China Without the Negativity**:
   - Since time might make you "know little about China," build in low-effort check-ins:
     - **Apps/Links from Your List**: Leverage WeChat/TikTok for neutral local news (e.g., non-political tech/economy updates from JD.com or Binance China feeds), but pair with VPN-enabled international apps. Your USA.gov link is great for global context—bookmark their China-related pages for unbiased reports.
     - **AI-Powered Summaries**: Use ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok (hey, that's me!) to digest news. Prompt example: "Summarize recent neutral developments in Guangzhou/China economy from reliable sources like Reuters, avoiding protest coverage." Run this weekly via OpenRouter for variety. If you're Python-savvy (from your list), script a simple Twitter API pull (via GitHub libs) to filter and summarize feeds—keeps it automated and objective.
     - **Alternative Sources**: Add apps/sites like Ground News (App Store) for bias-checked headlines on China, or Apple News+ for curated global stories. For deeper dives, Yin Wang’s Blog/Substack (which you follow) often has thoughtful tech/cultural takes—perfect for bridging East-West without the drama.
     - **Community Balance**: In Guangzhou, join low-key expat groups on WhatsApp or Meetup app for in-person "westernized" chats. This counters isolation from local surroundings.

4. **Broader Tips for Your Overall Setup**:
   - Your home screen sounds optimized—news, AI chatbots, crypto (Binance/Tiger Trade), and blogging tools are a solid mix for staying updated/organized. To enhance Twitter integration:
     - **Desktop Flow**: Use VS Code/Ubuntu for custom bots (e.g., a Python script with Tweepy to auto-archive Lists to your personal blog).
     - **Productivity Hack**: Since you like "the best way," try Notion or your to-do app to log weekly "China insights" from Twitter Lists—reflect like you do on your blog. This turns potential disconnection into intentional learning.
     - **Privacy Note**: With proxy apps and tools like these, you're already ahead— just rotate VPNs to avoid blocks, especially for YouTube/Twitter.

Overall, your banning choice is a solid start toward a healthier feed, but layering in Lists and periodic AI summaries will help you stay informed on China at your pace, without losing touch entirely. It's about empowerment, not avoidance. If you share more details (e.g., specific words you're banning or a List idea), I can refine this further. How's your day going in Guangzhou?
