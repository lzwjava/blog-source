## **4. How to Use Wisely as a Chinese Citizen**

### **A. Cross-Border Considerations**
- **Taiwan**: Widely accepted, but notify HSBC HK before travel to avoid blocks.
- **Mainland China**:
  - Use at **UnionPay terminals** (if co-branded) or international merchants.
  - Online: Some Chinese platforms (e.g., Taobao, WeChat Pay) may not accept foreign debit cards. Use alternatives like Alipay HK or international payment methods.
- **Exchange Rates**: Avoid dynamic currency conversion (DCC) at merchants; always pay in local currency.

### **B. Fees to Watch For**
- **Foreign Transaction Fee**: ~1.95% for non-HKD transactions.
- **ATM Fees**: HSBC HK may charge for withdrawals outside Hong Kong (e.g., ~HKD 30-50 per withdrawal in Taiwan).
- **Currency Conversion**: HSBC’s exchange rate + fee is often better than exchanging cash.

### **C. Maximizing Benefits**
- **No Annual Fee**: Most HSBC HK debit cards have no annual fee.
- **Promotions**: Check the app for Mastercard/HSBC discounts (e.g., shopping, dining).
- **Link to Multi-Currency Account**: If you have one, hold TWD/CNY to avoid conversion fees.

### **D. Tax and Regulations**
- **Taiwan**: No restrictions on using HK-issued cards, but large transactions may require explanation.
- **Mainland China**: Foreign debit cards are subject to **USD 50,000 annual forex limit** per person (PBOC regulation). Track your spending to avoid issues.

## **5. Tips for Smart Usage**
- **Withdraw Cash Wisely**: Use HSBC ATMs in Taiwan (e.g., at HSBC Taiwan branches) to minimize fees.
- **Avoid Cash Advances**: High fees and interest apply if you use the card for cash advances.
- **Budgeting**: Use the app to track spending and avoid overdrafts.
- **Emergency Support**: Save HSBC HK’s 24/7 customer service number (+852 2233 3000).

---

## **6. What to Do If Issues Arise**
- **Lost/Stolen Card**: Freeze it immediately via the app and request a replacement.
- **Declined Transactions**: Check for sufficient funds, card blocks, or merchant restrictions.
- **Disputes**: Report unauthorized transactions within 30 days via the app or customer service.

---

## **7. Alternatives for Mainland China**
If you frequently use the card in mainland China:
- Open a **HSBC China account** and link it to your HK account for easier transfers.
- Use **Alipay HK** or **WeChat Pay HK** (if available) for local payments.
