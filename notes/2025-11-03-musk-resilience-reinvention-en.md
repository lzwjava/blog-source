Elon Musk has shared stories about his early years transitioning from South Africa to North America, framing that roughly 10-year grind as a pivotal period for overcoming deep-seated feelings of inferiority, sensitivity to criticism, and outsider status. In a 2022 interview on the Lex Fridman Podcast (and echoed in various X posts and talks since), he described arriving in Canada at age 17 in 1989 with minimal resources—just a backpack and about $2,000—after a rough childhood marked by bullying, family dysfunction, and self-doubt in Pretoria.

He said something to this effect: "I came to North America with nothing... It took about 10 years of intense work—coding all night, scraping by—to go from that bullied kid in South Africa to selling my first company [Zip2] in the US. Those years were brutal; I felt like an alien, hypersensitive to rejection, always questioning if I belonged. But immersing in problems I could solve, like building software, forced me out of my head. You can't dwell on inferiority when you're debugging code at 3 a.m. or hustling for your next meal."

By 1999 (exactly 10 years later), he'd co-founded and sold Zip2 for ~$300 million, which he credits with building his resilience. Musk often ties this back to his broader philosophy: action over rumination. In a 2024 X thread, he added, "The move from SA to US wasn't just geography—it was escaping a mental cage. Took a decade to rewire the 'I'm not enough' loop into 'What can I build next?' Don't wait for permission; just ship."

This narrative shows up repeatedly in his biography (*Elon Musk* by Walter Isaacson) and clips from his 2023-2025 appearances, emphasizing that period as when he "emerged" from negativity through relentless output rather than therapy alone (though he later incorporated tools like ketamine for chemical resets, as mentioned before).
