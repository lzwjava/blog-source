Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as combat, sexual assault, natural disasters, accidents, or violence. It involves persistent psychological distress that interferes with daily life, often lasting for months or years if untreated. PTSD affects people of all ages and backgrounds, with symptoms typically emerging within three months of the trauma but sometimes delayed.

## Symptoms
PTSD symptoms are grouped into four main categories and must persist for at least a month to meet diagnostic criteria:

- **Intrusion symptoms**: Unwanted, distressing memories, flashbacks, nightmares, or intense emotional/physical reactions to reminders of the event.
- **Avoidance**: Steering clear of thoughts, feelings, people, places, or activities that trigger memories of the trauma.
- **Negative changes in thinking and mood**: Feelings of detachment, hopelessness, guilt, shame, or inability to experience positive emotions; distorted blame or negative beliefs about oneself or the world.
- **Changes in physical and emotional reactions (arousal)**: Irritability, angry outbursts, reckless behavior, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, concentration issues, or sleep disturbances.

## Causes and Risk Factors
PTSD can result from a single event or repeated exposure to trauma. Not everyone who experiences trauma develops PTSD; risk factors include the severity of the event, lack of support, prior mental health issues, or additional stressors like ongoing abuse.

## Diagnosis and Treatment
Diagnosis involves a clinical evaluation based on criteria from the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). Effective treatments include:

- **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), prolonged exposure therapy, or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).
- **Medications**: Antidepressants like SSRIs (e.g., sertraline or paroxetine) to manage symptoms.
- **Self-care**: Exercise, mindfulness, support groups, and lifestyle changes.

Early intervention improves outcomes. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms, seek help from a mental health professional.
