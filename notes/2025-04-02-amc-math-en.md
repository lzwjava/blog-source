The American Mathematics Competitions (AMC) are a series of examinations designed to challenge and enhance the problem-solving skills of middle and high school students. The specific math knowledge required varies depending on the level of the competition: AMC 8, AMC 10, and AMC 12.

### AMC 8

This competition is aimed at students in grades 8 and below and covers a typical middle school mathematics curriculum. The topics include:

* **Arithmetic and Logic:** Basic operations, fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios, proportions, number properties (even, odd, prime, composite), divisibility rules, estimation, and logical reasoning.
* **Number Theory:** Factors, multiples, greatest common divisor (GCD), least common multiple (LCM), prime factorization.
* **Algebraic Word Problems:** Solving linear equations, basic algebraic expressions, and translating word problems into algebraic equations.
* **Counting and Probability:** Basic counting principles, permutations, combinations, simple probability calculations.
* **Estimation, Patterns, and Proportional Reasoning:** Recognizing and extending patterns, solving problems involving direct and inverse proportions.
* **Elementary Geometry:** Basic shapes (triangles, squares, rectangles, circles), perimeter, area, volume (for simple solids like cubes and rectangular prisms), basic angle properties, and the Pythagorean Theorem.
* **Reading and Interpreting Graphs and Tables:** Extracting and interpreting information from various graphical and tabular representations.
* **Introduction to Functions and Coordinate Geometry:** Some later questions might touch on linear or quadratic functions and equations, and basic concepts of the coordinate plane.

### AMC 10

This competition is for students in grades 10 and below and covers a high school mathematics curriculum up to the 10th grade. It assumes knowledge of the topics covered in AMC 8 and expands to include:

* **Algebra:** Linear equations and inequalities, quadratic equations, polynomials, functions (linear, quadratic, and basic rational and exponential), sequences and series, logarithms.
* **Geometry:** More advanced plane geometry, including properties of triangles, quadrilaterals, circles, and other polygons; coordinate geometry (lines, distances, slopes, equations of circles); and spatial visualization.
* **Number Theory:** Divisibility rules, prime numbers, modular arithmetic, Diophantine equations (basic).
* **Probability:** More complex probability problems involving multiple events, conditional probability, and expected value.
* **Combinatorics:** Advanced counting techniques, permutations, combinations, inclusion-exclusion principle.

**Important Note for AMC 10:** The AMC 10 does **not** include trigonometry, advanced algebra, or advanced geometry.

### General Information about AMC Math Knowledge

* **Problem-Solving Focus:** The AMC competitions emphasize creative problem-solving skills and the ability to apply mathematical knowledge in novel and challenging ways, rather than just rote memorization of formulas.
* **No Calculus or Trigonometry (for AMC 8 & 10):** These topics are not required for the AMC 8 and AMC 10. The AMC 12 includes trigonometry, advanced algebra, and advanced geometry.
* **Building Blocks:** The knowledge tested in the AMC 8 forms a foundation for the AMC 10, which in turn lays the groundwork for more advanced competitions like the AMC 12 and the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME).
* **Integrated Mathematics:** The problems often integrate concepts from different areas of mathematics. For example, a geometry problem might involve algebraic techniques to solve it.
* **Depth over Breadth (Initially):** While a broad understanding of the listed topics is necessary, the difficulty often arises from the depth of understanding and the ability to apply these concepts in unfamiliar situations.

By focusing on building a strong foundation in the core areas of mathematics relevant to each competition level and developing strong problem-solving strategies, students can prepare effectively for the American Mathematics Competitions.
