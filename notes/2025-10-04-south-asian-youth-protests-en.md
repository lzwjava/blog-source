### Sri Lanka
In 2022, Sri Lanka faced a severe economic crisis, including fuel shortages, power cuts, and skyrocketing inflation, which sparked the Aragalaya ("The Struggle") protest movement. Led largely by young people and students, demonstrators occupied key sites in Colombo, such as Galle Face Green, demanding the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and an end to corruption. The protests, marked by creative activism like sit-ins and cultural performances, culminated in July 2022 when protesters stormed the presidential palace, forcing Rajapaksa to flee the country. This led to a political transition, with Ranil Wickremesinghe becoming president. The movement highlighted youth frustration with entrenched elites and inspired similar actions across South Asia.

### Indonesia
Starting in February 2025, student-led protests erupted across major cities like Jakarta and Bandung against President Prabowo Subianto's government, focusing on economic inequality, corruption, and perceived authoritarian policies. Young demonstrators, often from universities, demanded reforms to education funding and job opportunities. Tensions peaked in late August 2025 with widespread clashes, resulting in at least 10 deaths, hundreds injured, and over 3,000 arrests amid a government crackdown. The protests involved diverse groups, including non-students, and continue into September 2025, signaling growing youth discontent with political dynasties.

### Bangladesh
The most prominent youth-led protests occurred in July-August 2024, triggered by the government's decision to reinstate a 30% quota for civil service jobs reserved for descendants of 1971 war veterans—seen as favoring ruling party loyalists. University students, organized under groups like the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, took to the streets nationwide, using social media to mobilize. The demonstrations turned violent after government crackdowns, killing over 200 people, but ultimately forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to India on August 5, 2024. An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was installed, with students playing key roles in the transition. In 2025, tensions persist, including a July rally in Gopalganj where four were killed in clashes involving the youth-led National Citizen Party.
