Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is a global semiconductor company known for its microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), and other computing technologies. Founded in 1969, AMD has played a pivotal role in shaping the computing industry, competing with giants like Intel and NVIDIA. Below is a comprehensive introduction to AMD’s history, tracing its origins, milestones, challenges, and evolution.

### Founding and Early Years (1969–1980s)
AMD was founded on May 1, 1969, by Jerry Sanders III and seven other former Fairchild Semiconductor executives, including Edwin Turney and Jack Gifford. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, AMD started as a second-source manufacturer of integrated circuits, producing chips designed by other companies under license. This was a common practice in the early semiconductor industry to ensure supply chain stability.

- **Early Focus**: AMD initially produced logic chips and memory devices, competing with companies like Intel, Texas Instruments, and Motorola. Its first product was the Am9300, a 4-bit shift register, released in 1970.
- **Second-Source Agreements**: In the 1970s, AMD became a key second-source supplier for Intel’s processors, including the 8080 microprocessor. This relationship helped AMD build expertise in microprocessor manufacturing.
- **Going Public**: AMD went public in 1972, raising capital to expand its operations.
- **Legal Battles with Intel**: By the late 1970s, AMD’s growing ambition led to tensions with Intel. In 1976, AMD signed a cross-licensing agreement with Intel to produce x86-compatible chips, setting the stage for its future as a direct competitor.

In the 1980s, AMD expanded its product portfolio and manufacturing capabilities:
- **Microprocessors**: AMD began producing its own designs, such as the Am2900 series of bit-slice processors, used in minicomputers and industrial applications.
- **x86 Processors**: Under the Intel agreement, AMD manufactured x86 processors like the 8086 and 80286, which powered early personal computers (PCs).
- **Challenges**: The PC market’s growth in the 1980s intensified competition. AMD faced legal disputes with Intel over the x86 licensing agreement, as Intel sought to limit AMD’s access to newer designs like the 80386.

### Rise as a Competitor (1990s)
The 1990s marked AMD’s transformation from a second-source supplier to a major innovator in the microprocessor market, driven by its rivalry with Intel.

- **Legal Victory**: In 1991, AMD won a landmark legal battle against Intel, securing the right to produce x86-compatible processors. This allowed AMD to develop its own microarchitectures.
- **K5 and K6 Processors**: In 1996, AMD released the K5, its first independent x86 processor, followed by the K6 in 1997. The K6 was a commercial success, offering competitive performance at lower prices than Intel’s Pentium processors.
- **Acquisition of NexGen**: In 1996, AMD acquired NexGen, a company developing x86-compatible processors. NexGen’s technology influenced AMD’s later designs.
- **Athlon Breakthrough**: In 1999, AMD launched the Athlon (K7) processor, a game-changer that outperformed Intel’s Pentium III in many benchmarks. The Athlon established AMD as a serious competitor in the high-performance PC market.

During this period, AMD also ventured into flash memory and other semiconductor products, diversifying its portfolio to compete with companies like Samsung and Micron.

### Challenges and Recovery (2000s)
The early 2000s were a mixed period for AMD, with significant achievements overshadowed by financial struggles and intense competition.

- **Opteron and Athlon 64 (2003)**: AMD introduced the x86-64 architecture, extending the x86 instruction set to 64 bits. The Opteron (for servers) and Athlon 64 (for desktops) were the first 64-bit processors for mainstream computing, giving AMD a technological edge over Intel. These chips were widely adopted, particularly in data centers.
- **Acquisition of ATI Technologies (2006)**: AMD acquired ATI, a leading GPU manufacturer, for $5.4 billion. This move expanded AMD’s portfolio to include graphics cards (Radeon) and chipsets, positioning it to compete with NVIDIA and Intel in integrated computing solutions.
- **Financial Struggles**: Despite technical successes, AMD faced financial challenges due to Intel’s aggressive pricing, market dominance, and AMD’s high debt from the ATI acquisition. By the late 2000s, AMD was losing money and market share.
- **Barcelona Flaws**: The 2007 launch of the Phenom and Opteron “Barcelona” processors was marred by a critical bug (the TLB erratum), damaging AMD’s reputation in the server market.
- **Spin-Off of Manufacturing**: In 2008, AMD spun off its manufacturing division into GlobalFoundries, a separate company backed by Abu Dhabi’s Advanced Technology Investment Company. This made AMD a fabless semiconductor company, relying on third-party foundries like GlobalFoundries and TSMC for chip production.

### Renaissance with Ryzen and EPYC (2010s)
The 2010s were a transformative decade for AMD, marked by a remarkable turnaround under new leadership and innovative products.

- **Bulldozer Disappointment (2011)**: AMD’s Bulldozer architecture, designed for high core counts, underperformed in single-threaded tasks and failed to compete with Intel’s Core series. This led to further market share losses and financial strain.
- **Leadership Change**: In 2014, Dr. Lisa Su became AMD’s CEO, bringing a focus on engineering excellence and strategic restructuring.
- **Zen Architecture and Ryzen (2017)**: AMD’s Zen architecture, launched with Ryzen processors in 2017, was a resounding success. Ryzen offered competitive performance, higher core counts, and better value than Intel’s offerings, regaining AMD significant market share in desktops and laptops.
- **EPYC for Servers**: Also in 2017, AMD introduced EPYC processors for data centers, challenging Intel’s Xeon dominance. EPYC’s high core counts, efficiency, and competitive pricing won over major cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.
- **Radeon and Instinct GPUs**: AMD continued to develop its Radeon GPUs for gaming and professional markets. It also launched Instinct accelerators for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), targeting NVIDIA’s data center dominance.
- **7nm Process Leadership**: In 2019, AMD adopted TSMC’s 7nm process for its Ryzen 3000 and EPYC Rome processors, leapfrogging Intel, which struggled with its 10nm transition. This gave AMD a performance and efficiency advantage.

By the end of the decade, AMD’s stock price had soared, and it had regained significant ground in the CPU and GPU markets. Lisa Su’s leadership earned widespread praise, positioning AMD as a leader in the semiconductor industry.
