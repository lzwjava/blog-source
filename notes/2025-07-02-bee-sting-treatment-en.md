### Suitable Medications and Treatments:
Being stung by a bee or wasp requires choosing the right medication based on the severity of the injury and your physical condition. Since you mentioned being stung while swimming in Guangzhou, and the photo shows redness and swelling on your finger, I recommend the following medications and treatments. However, if allergic symptoms (e.g., difficulty breathing, worsening swelling) occur, stop using any medication immediately and call 120 for emergency help. The following suggestions are only for mild stings:

#### Suitable Medications and Treatments:
1. **Local Cleaning and Disinfection**  
   - **Medication**: Use saline or clean water to wash the wound, followed by povidone-iodine (iodophor swabs) or alcohol (below 75% concentration) for disinfection. Avoid high-concentration alcohol to prevent skin irritation.
   - **Purpose**: Removes venom and bacteria, preventing infection.

2. **Anti-inflammatory and Pain-Relief Ointment**  
   - **Recommendation**: Hydrocortisone ointment (0.1%-0.5%) or indomethacin ointment.
   - **Usage**: After cleaning, apply a thin layer to the stung area, 1-2 times per day.
   - **Effect**: Reduces redness, swelling, and pain with anti-inflammatory properties.
   - **Caution**: Avoid extensive use or prolonged application; use with caution in pregnant women and children.

3. **Antihistamine (Oral or Topical)**  
   - **Oral Recommendation**: Loratadine (Clarityne) or Cetirizine, with adult doses following the instructions (usually once daily).
   - **Topical Recommendation**: Antihistamine ointment (e.g., promethazine ointment).
   - **Usage**: Take oral medication after meals; apply topical ointment to the affected area, 1-2 times per day.
   - **Effect**: Relieves mild allergic reactions (e.g., redness, itching).
   - **Caution**: If you have no allergy history, start with a small amount and observe for 30 minutes.

4. **Cold Compress as an Aid**  
   - **Tool**: Ice pack or cold towel (wrapped in cloth).
   - **Usage**: Apply to the stung area for 10-15 minutes, repeatable every hour.
   - **Effect**: Reduces swelling and pain without medication.
   - **Caution**: Avoid direct contact with ice on the skin.

#### Medications to Avoid:
- **Corticosteroids (e.g., Prednisone)**: Unless prescribed by a doctor, self-use may mask serious symptoms.
- **Unverified Ointments**: Avoid using unknown herbal or homemade ointments to prevent worsening allergies.

#### Special Circumstances:
- **Allergy History or Worsening Symptoms**: Use an epinephrine auto-injector (if available) immediately and seek medical help. Major hospitals in Guangzhou (e.g., Zhongshan First Hospital, Zhongshan Second Hospital) can provide anti-allergy treatment.
- **Signs of Infection**: If the wound turns red, pus forms, or you develop a high fever, use an antibiotic ointment (e.g., mupirocin ointment) under medical guidance.

#### Current Recommendation:
Based on the photo and description, the current redness and swelling are mild. I suggest washing the wound with clean water, applying hydrocortisone ointment, and using a cold compress to observe. If there’s no discomfort, continue for 1-2 days; if swelling or pain worsens or allergic symptoms (e.g., rash, breathing difficulty) appear, go to the hospital immediately. It’s now 12:49 AM +08 on Wednesday, July 2, 2025, and pharmacies may be closed. Use any home medication if available; otherwise, visit a 24-hour pharmacy (e.g., Guangzhou Friendship Pharmacy) or hospital emergency room.

#### Important Reminder:
- These medication suggestions are for reference only. The final choice should be made in consultation with a doctor, especially since swimming may increase the risk of infection due to moisture.
- If you can describe more symptoms (e.g., pain level, allergy history), I can provide a more tailored suggestion!
