### **What is Payment Connect?**
Payment Connect is a real-time cross-border payment link between Hong Kong’s Faster Payment System (FPS) and mainland China’s Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS). Launched on June 22, 2025, it enables instant, secure, and low-cost transfers between Hong Kong and mainland China using just a mobile number or email address. This system is designed for both individuals and businesses, supporting daily transactions such as salaries, travel expenses, education fees, and more.

### **How Payment Connect Works**
- **Linkage**: FPS (Hong Kong) is directly connected to IBPS (mainland China), allowing users to send and receive funds across the border in real time.
- **Participants**: Over 17 million FPS users in Hong Kong can now transfer up to HK$10,000 per day to 298 million IBPS users in mainland China.
- **Supported Banks**: HSBC Hong Kong, China Merchant Bank (CMB), and several other major banks are part of this network. HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Bank of Communications also allow Hong Kong residents to open mainland bank accounts remotely, facilitating easier cross-border transactions.

### **How to Use Payment Connect for Transfers**

#### **1. Prerequisites**
- **HSBC Hong Kong Account**: Ensure you have an active HSBC Hong Kong account with FPS enabled. You can register your mobile number or email as your FPS ID.
- **China Merchant Bank (CMB) Account**: The recipient must have a CMB account linked to IBPS, with a registered mobile number or email as their IBPS ID.

#### **2. Transfer Process (HSBC HK to CMB)**
1. **Log in** to your HSBC Hong Kong mobile banking app or online banking.
2. **Select “FPS Transfer”** and choose the option for cross-border transfer to mainland China.
3. **Enter Recipient Details**: Use the recipient’s mainland China mobile number or email address (linked to their CMB IBPS account).
4. **Enter Amount**: The daily limit is HK$10,000 per linked bank account.
5. **Confirm and Send**: Review the details and confirm the transfer. The funds will be credited instantly to the recipient’s CMB account in RMB.

#### **3. Transfer Process (CMB to HSBC HK)**
- The process is similar: the sender in mainland China uses their CMB app, selects the cross-border FPS option, enters your HSBC FPS ID (mobile/email), and sends the funds.
