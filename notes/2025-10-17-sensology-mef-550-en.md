### How the Sensology MEF-550 Formaldehyde Detector Works

The Sensology MEF-550 is a portable, handheld air quality monitor designed for indoor use, such as in homes, offices, or operating rooms. It functions as an integrated detector that simultaneously measures multiple air pollutants, including formaldehyde (HCHO), total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10), temperature, and humidity. The device draws in ambient air through an internal sampling mechanism and processes it via specialized sensors to provide real-time readings on its LCD display. Data can be viewed in numerical, graphical, or historical formats, with alerts for exceeding safe thresholds (based on standards like China's GB/T 18883-2002 for TVOC).

The core operation relies on a combination of sensor technologies:
- **Electrochemical sensor for formaldehyde (HCHO)**: This sensor works by triggering an electrochemical reaction when formaldehyde molecules in the air contact the electrode surface. The reaction generates a measurable electrical current proportional to the HCHO concentration. The device converts this signal into a digital reading (in mg/m³).
- **Semiconductor sensor (WINSEN brand) for TVOC**: Volatile organic compounds alter the electrical conductivity of a metal oxide semiconductor material. The change in resistance is detected and quantified to estimate TVOC levels.
- **Laser sensor for particulate matter (PM)**: A laser beam scatters light off airborne particles, and the scattering pattern is analyzed to determine particle size and concentration (using light scattering principles).
- **Additional sensors**: Thermistor-based for temperature and capacitive for humidity, providing contextual data that influences overall air quality assessment.

The device powers via USB (5V DC) and requires periodic calibration (typically every 6-12 months) for optimal performance. Sampling is passive (diffusion-based) or active (with internal fan for faster response), taking about 1-5 minutes per full scan.

### How It Detects Air Quality

Air quality detection on the MEF-550 is multifaceted, focusing on key pollutants linked to health risks like respiratory issues, allergies, and cancer (e.g., formaldehyde from furniture off-gassing or PM from smoke/dust). It provides a holistic view rather than a single index:
- **Formaldehyde (HCHO)**: Targets this specific irritant (range: 0–2.5 mg/m³), alerting if levels exceed 0.08 mg/m³ (WHO guideline).
- **TVOC**: Measures a broad range of gases from paints, cleaners, etc. (range: 0–9.999 mg/m³), with thresholds around 0.6 mg/m³ for good air quality.
- **PM1/PM2.5/PM10**: Quantifies fine and coarse particles (range: 0–999 μg/m³), crucial for assessing dust, smoke, or pollution (e.g., PM2.5 >25 μg/m³ indicates poor quality).
- **Temperature and humidity**: Influences pollutant behavior (e.g., high humidity promotes mold/VOC release), with ranges typically 0–50°C and 0–99% RH.

Readings are color-coded (green/yellow/red) on the display for quick interpretation, and it logs data for trend analysis. In studies, it's used to track pollutant decay in controlled environments, like post-smoke purification.

### Is It Accurate?

The MEF-550 offers solid accuracy for a consumer-grade device, with manufacturer specs indicating:
- **HCHO**: < ±1% measurement error, <2% repeatability; resolution 0.01 mg/m³.
- **TVOC**: < ±1% error; resolution 0.01 mg/m³.
- **PM**: Resolution 0.1 μg/m³ (accuracy not separately specified but integrated within <1% overall error).

In scientific testing (e.g., air purification studies), it reliably measured pollutant removal rates up to 99% with consistent decay tracking. However, like many electrochemical formaldehyde sensors, it can experience cross-sensitivity to interferents like alcohols or high humidity, potentially overestimating by 10-20% in complex environments. Calibration is key, and it's more accurate than basic color-changing badges but less precise than lab-grade photoacoustic spectrometers. User reviews are sparse, but in professional contexts (e.g., hospitals), it's deemed reliable for spot-checks. For critical applications, pair with periodic lab validation.
