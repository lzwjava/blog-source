### Notes
- **Selection Criteria**: Projects were chosen for their prominence, active maintenance, and significant C++ usage. Some (e.g., TensorFlow, Electron) use other languages for interfaces but rely on C++ for core functionality.
- **Diversity**: The list covers game engines (Godot, Unreal), AI (TensorFlow, CNTK), databases (MongoDB, ClickHouse), multimedia (OBS, Kodi), and libraries (Boost, Abseil).
- **Community & Maintenance**: Most projects have active communities, but some (e.g., CNTK) are less active but still impactful.
- **Verification**: I cross-referenced sources like GitHub rankings, community discussions, and project websites to ensure relevance.[](https://blog.codacy.com/cpp-open-source-projects)[](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/open-source-projects-for-cplusplus/)[](https://www.rocket.chat/blog/open-source-projects)
- **Real-Time Data**: If you want current GitHub stars or more specific metrics, I can perform a search to update the list with precise figures.
- **Contributing**: Many projects (e.g., Godot, OBS) have “good first issue” labels for beginners. Check their GitHub pages for contribution guidelines.
