### Trip Overview
I've planned a 5-day road trip itinerary for you, starting from Guangzhou on July 11 at 7 PM and returning by July 17 at 12 PM. The route forms a loop: Guangzhou → Xiamen → Longyan → Fuzhou → Guangzhou, covering all your requested destinations in Fujian Province. This allows for efficient driving while prioritizing your interest in oceans and beaches (focusing on Xiamen's coastal spots and Fuzhou's islands/beaches, with Longyan for cultural contrast via its famous Tulou earth buildings).

**Key Details:**
- **Total Distance:** Approximately 1,960 km round-trip.
- **Vehicle:** EV Neta with a 400 km range. I've planned conservative stops every 300-350 km for charging (assuming fast chargers; add 30-60 minutes per stop). China has extensive EV infrastructure on highways (e.g., via apps like Tesla Supercharger network, State Grid, or Teld for non-Tesla EVs). Use apps like AutoNavi or Baidu Maps for real-time station locations.
- **Driving Assumptions:** Average speed 80-100 km/h on highways; factor in traffic, especially near cities. July is peak summer—hot (28-31°C), humid, and potentially rainy/typhoon-prone in Fujian. Check forecasts daily via apps like China Weather.
- **Preferences Incorporated:** Emphasis on beaches and ocean views in Xiamen and Fuzhou. Longyan is inland, so I've allocated less time there for Tulou visits.
- **Cares & Tips:**
  - **EV-Specific:** Monitor battery closely; charge to 80% for efficiency. Download charging apps (e.g., Xingxing Charge, Teld) and carry a portable charger/cables. Highways like G15 Shenhai Expressway have stations every 50-100 km.
  - **Weather:** Hot and humid; pack sunscreen, hats, light clothing, rain gear, and insect repellent. Typhoons are possible—have backup plans for indoor activities.
  - **General:** Book hotels/accommodations in advance (e.g., via Ctrip or Booking.com). Carry cash/ID for tolls (electronic tolls common). Stay hydrated, avoid midday heat for beach activities. Fuel costs: Expect 200-300 CNY in electricity; tolls ~500 CNY round-trip.
  - **Health/Safety:** COVID rules may apply; wear masks if needed. Drive safely—rest if tired.
  - **Budget Estimate (excluding fuel/tolls):** Accommodations ~1,500 CNY, meals ~500 CNY, attractions ~300 CNY (for 1 person; adjust for group).
