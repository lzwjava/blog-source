Thanks for sharing your experience—sounds frustrating when a model claims to update code but doesn't follow through. From what I've gathered, this seems like a common hiccup with Grok Code Fast 1 in setups like Claude Code Router (or similar tools like Cline/Kilo Code), often tied to quirks in tool calling. It can output updates in unexpected places (e.g., reasoning tags instead of direct actions), leading to incomplete or failed edits despite the "success" message.

Glad to hear switching to MiniMax M2 has smoothed things out—it's been picking up steam for exactly these kinds of reliable coding workflows, especially in multi-model routers. If you're still tweaking the setup:

- Double-check your router config for Grok (e.g., ensure tool schemas are strictly enforced to avoid stray outputs).
- As a workaround, some folks route Grok tasks through a LiteLLM proxy for better compatibility.
- If it persists, filing a quick issue on the relevant repo (like [musistudio/claude-code-router](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router) or [Kilo-Org/kilocode](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode)) with your exact prompt/setup could help the community debug it faster.

xAI's team is iterating on Grok models for tighter tool integration, so expect refinements soon. What specific coding tasks are you tackling where MiniMax shines for you?
