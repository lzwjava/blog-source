### Location of the New York Public Library
The New York Public Library (NYPL) is one of the most iconic institutions in New York City. Its flagship branch, known as the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building (often just called the Main Branch), is located at:

- **Address**: 476 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10018 (between 40th and 42nd Streets in Midtown Manhattan).
- **How to Get There**: It's a short walk from Grand Central Terminal (about 0.3 miles). The nearest subway stations are on the 4, 5, 6, 7 lines at Grand Central-42nd Street or the B, D, F, M lines at 42nd Street-Bryant Park. It's also right across from Bryant Park.

The NYPL system has over 90 locations across the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island, but the Main Branch is the most famous one with the iconic lion statues at the entrance.

### Brief History
The New York Public Library was officially established on **May 23, 1895**, through the merger of two older institutions: the Astor Library (founded in 1848 by philanthropist John Jacob Astor) and the Lenox Library (created in 1870 by bibliophile James Lenox, known for its rare books and art collection). It was further expanded by a major grant from steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, who funded 65 branch libraries across the city.

- **Key Milestones**:
  - **Early 20th Century**: The grand Fifth Avenue building opened in 1911, designed by architects John Merven Carrère and Thomas Hastings in Beaux-Arts style. It quickly became a symbol of American intellectual life, housing millions of books and serving as a research hub.
  - **Growth and Challenges**: By the mid-20th century, the NYPL had amassed over 10 million items. It faced budget issues in the 1970s and 1980s but was revitalized through renovations and public support. The 2011-2012 restoration of its Rose Main Reading Room highlighted its enduring importance.
  - **Today**: It's the largest public library system in the United States by circulation (over 20 million items annually) and holds about 55 million items, including books, maps, photos, and digital archives. It's free and open to the public, serving millions of visitors, researchers, and scholars. Fun fact: It's been featured in movies like *Ghostbusters* and *The Day After Tomorrow* (though the latter was fictionalized).
