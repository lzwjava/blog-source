### Uses of Spring Request Filters

Spring request filters (often implemented via `javax.servlet.Filter` or Spring's `OncePerRequestFilter`) are powerful components in Spring Boot and Spring MVC applications. They intercept HTTP requests and responses before they reach your controllers (or after leaving them), allowing you to perform cross-cutting concerns without cluttering business logic. Here's a breakdown of common use cases:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Validate user credentials (e.g., JWT tokens) or check permissions early in the request lifecycle. Spring Security heavily relies on filters for this, chaining them via `FilterChainProxy` to secure endpoints without controller involvement.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Capture request details like headers, body, timestamps, or IP addresses for auditing, debugging, or analytics. This is useful for tracing issues in production.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Inspect and clean incoming data (e.g., remove malicious scripts, enforce size limits) to prevent attacks like SQL injection or XSS.

- **CORS Handling**: Manage Cross-Origin Resource Sharing by adding or validating headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, enabling secure API access from web browsers.

- **Request/Response Modification**: Alter headers, bodies, or URLs on the fly—e.g., adding custom headers for security (like `X-Frame-Options`) or compressing responses with GZIP.

- **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Enforce API usage limits per user or IP to prevent abuse, DDoS attacks, or overload.

- **Caching Control**: Add cache headers (e.g., `Cache-Control`) or integrate with caching layers like Redis to optimize performance.

- **Error Handling and Metrics**: Catch exceptions globally, log errors, or collect metrics (e.g., via Micrometer) before propagating to the response.

Filters execute outside the Spring DispatcherServlet, making them ideal for low-level concerns, unlike interceptors which are more Spring-specific and controller-focused. For implementation, extend `OncePerRequestFilter` to avoid multiple executions per request.
