I’m assuming you’re asking about NVIDIA’s Isaac platform, likely in the context of recent news or developments, given your query "Isaac NVIDIA" and the provided search context. Since you mentioned "yes," it seems you might be confirming or following up on a previous question, but without more details, I’ll focus on giving you a concise overview of NVIDIA’s Isaac platform and relevant updates, incorporating the real-time financial data and web results where applicable.

NVIDIA’s Isaac platform is a comprehensive robotics development ecosystem designed to accelerate the creation, simulation, and deployment of AI-powered robots. It includes tools like **Isaac Sim** for realistic virtual simulations, **Isaac Lab** for robot learning, and **Isaac SDK** for building robotic applications. The platform leverages NVIDIA’s expertise in AI, CUDA-accelerated computing, and generative AI models to enable robots to perceive, navigate, and interact with complex environments, such as warehouses, factories, or healthcare settings. Key components include:

- **Isaac Sim**: A simulation tool built on NVIDIA Omniverse, allowing developers to design, test, and train AI-driven robots in physically accurate virtual environments. Recent updates (e.g., Isaac Sim 5.0, available in developer preview on GitHub as of June 2025) include open-source extensions for synthetic data generation and improved physics modeling.[](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/isaac-sim-and-isaac-lab-are-now-available-for-early-developer-preview/)[](https://blockchain.news/news/nvidia-unveils-early-previews-isaac-sim-isaac-lab)
- **Isaac Lab**: A framework for training robot policies, with features like GR00T N1 benchmarking and synthetic motion generation for manipulation tasks.[](https://blockchain.news/news/nvidia-unveils-early-previews-isaac-sim-isaac-lab)
- **Isaac GR00T**: A foundation model for humanoid robot reasoning and skills, with GR00T N1.5 (released May 2025) improving adaptability for tasks like material handling. It’s used by companies like Agility Robotics and NEURA Robotics.[](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-powers-humanoid-robot-industry-with-cloud-to-robot-computing-platforms-for-physical-ai)
- **Isaac ROS**: Built on ROS 2, it integrates NVIDIA’s accelerated libraries for faster development of autonomous robots.[](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/robotics/)

Recent news highlights NVIDIA’s push in robotics:
