Rust does **not** have exceptions in the traditional sense, like Java or C\#. Instead, it handles errors primarily through **return values**, similar to Go's `if err != nil` pattern, but with a more robust and type-safe approach.

Here's a breakdown of how Rust handles errors:

**1. `Result<T, E>` Enum for Recoverable Errors:**

This is the most common and idiomatic way to handle errors in Rust.

  * `Result<T, E>` is an enum with two variants:
      * `Ok(T)`: Represents success and contains the successful value of type `T`.
      * `Err(E)`: Represents failure and contains an error value of type `E`.
  * When a function might fail, it returns a `Result`. This forces the caller to explicitly deal with both the success (`Ok`) and failure (`Err`) cases.
  * You use `match` expressions or various helper methods (like `map`, `and_then`, `unwrap_or`, `unwrap_or_else`, etc.) to handle the `Ok` and `Err` variants.

**Example:**

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => match error.kind() {
            ErrorKind::NotFound => match File::create("hello.txt") {
                Ok(fc) => fc,
                Err(e) => panic!("Problem creating the file: {:?}", e),
            },
            other_error => panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", other_error),
        },
    };

    println!("Successfully opened or created file: {:?}", greeting_file);
}
```

**2. `Option<T>` Enum for Optional Values:**

While not strictly for "errors," `Option<T>` is similar to `Result` in that it represents the *possibility of absence*.

  * `Option<T>` has two variants:
      * `Some(T)`: The value is present.
      * `None`: The value is absent.
  * This is used when a function might legitimately not return a value (e.g., finding an element in a list that might not exist).

**3. The `?` Operator (Question Mark Operator):**

This is a powerful syntactic sugar that makes propagating errors much more concise, similar to how `if err != nil { return err }` is common in Go.

  * If a `Result` value is `Ok`, the `?` operator unwraps the `Ok` value and the execution continues.
  * If a `Result` value is `Err`, the `?` operator immediately returns the `Err` value from the current function.
  * The function using `?` must itself return a `Result` (or `Option` if it's unwrapping an `Option`).

**Example with `?`:**

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read}; // Import io::Read trait

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut username_file = File::open("hello.txt")?; // Propagates error if file doesn't exist
    let mut username = String::new();
    username_file.read_to_string(&mut username)?; // Propagates error if reading fails
    Ok(username)
}

fn main() {
    match read_username_from_file() {
        Ok(username) => println!("Username: {}", username),
        Err(e) => println!("Error reading username: {}", e),
    }
}
```

**4. `panic!` Macro for Unrecoverable Errors:**

`panic!` is used for unrecoverable errors, which typically indicate a bug in the program (e.g., accessing an array out of bounds).

  * When `panic!` is called, the program will terminate (or "unwind" the stack, depending on configuration).
  * It's generally discouraged for recoverable errors that your program should handle gracefully.

**Key Differences from Traditional Exceptions:**

  * **Explicitness:** Rust's error handling is highly explicit. The function signature clearly indicates that it can return an error, and the compiler *forces* you to handle it. You cannot accidentally ignore an error.
  * **No "Catch-all" Blocks:** There are no `try-catch` blocks that silently catch any exception. You deal with specific error types.
  * **Type Safety:** Errors are values of specific types (`Result<T, E>`), allowing for precise error handling and avoiding the ambiguity of generic exception types.
  * **Performance:** Returning `Result` values is generally more performant than throwing and catching exceptions, as exceptions often involve significant overhead (stack unwinding, etc.). Rust is designed for performance-critical applications.

In summary, Rust's error handling model is much closer to Go's "check in every level" philosophy than to Java's or C\#'s exceptions. However, with the `Result` enum and the `?` operator, Rust provides powerful and ergonomic tools to make this explicit error handling manageable and even enjoyable.
