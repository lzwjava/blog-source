The reasons why McDonald's Drive-Thru is not popular in China can be analyzed from multiple perspectives, including culture, consumer habits, urban environment, and economic factors. Here are the main reasons:

1. **Differences in Car Ownership and Usage Habits**:  
   Although car ownership in China has increased significantly in recent years, compared to countries like the United States with a deeply ingrained car culture, China's car penetration and daily usage scenarios remain limited. In the U.S., cars are central to life, and many people are accustomed to completing various activities, including dining, in their vehicles. In China, especially in large cities, public transportation, shared bikes, and walking are still primary modes of travel for many, reducing the demand for drive-thru ordering.

2. **Differences in Dining and Consumer Culture**:  
   Chinese consumers prefer dining in restaurants or opting for delivery services rather than eating quickly in their cars. Fast food in China is often seen as a social or leisure experience, especially in cities where McDonald's and similar chains serve as venues for gatherings or short breaks. Additionally, China's highly developed food delivery market (e.g., Meituan, Ele.me) offers convenient delivery options, diminishing the appeal of drive-thrus.

3. **Urban Space and Planning Constraints**:  
   Land resources in Chinese cities are scarce, particularly in first-tier cities, where space for standalone drive-thru restaurants with parking lots and car lanes is limited. Drive-thrus require dedicated lanes and larger premises, which are incompatible with the high-density, high-rent commercial environments of city centers. In contrast, traditional restaurants or delivery services are better suited to urban spatial layouts.

4. **Operational Costs vs. Returns Mismatch**:  
   Drive-thru restaurants require additional lane designs, equipment maintenance, and staff training, leading to higher operational costs. However, due to insufficient consumer demand for drive-thrus in China, the return on investment may be low. Instead, McDonald's in China focuses on localized menus and enhancing in-store experiences to attract more customers.

5. **Local Competition and Consumer Upgrading**:  
   As China's餐饮市场连锁化程度提高 (catering market becomes more chain-oriented), local fast-food brands (e.g., Tastin) offer menus better suited to local tastes and more cost-effective options, posing competitive pressure on McDonald's. Consumers prefer diverse dining experiences over relying on the single model of drive-thrus.

6. **Historical and Promotional Limitations**:  
   Although the first McDonald's Drive-Thru in mainland China opened in Dongguan in 2005, the drive-thru model has had a short history of promotion in China and has not been a strategic focus for McDonald's. Instead, McDonald's prioritizes innovations like coffee zones, 24-hour operations, and dessert stations to enhance in-store consumption experiences.

**Summary**:  
McDonald's Drive-Thru is not popular in China due to differences in car culture, dining habits, urban space constraints, operational cost considerations, and competition from the delivery market. While drive-thrus have been attempted in certain regions (e.g., Dongguan, Northeast China), overall demand remains low, and McDonald's focuses on localization strategies and in-store services to adapt to the Chinese market.
