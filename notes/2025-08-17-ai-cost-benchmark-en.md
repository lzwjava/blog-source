Got it — let me unpack what you wrote and translate the idea into English, then analyze the issue.

### Restating the context
- In the LLM ecosystem, there isn’t yet a **standardized tool** that can accurately measure the cost of completing a specific *task* using different providers’ models.  
- Existing dashboards (like OpenRouter’s) only show prices, but *actual costs* depend on highly **variable factors**: prompt length, context window usage, caching efficiency (prompt re-use or "cache hits vs misses"), and output length.  
- Because of this, people often just *guess* and choose a model balancing cost and quality, without precise cost prediction.  
- By analogy, just as the field has standardized **benchmarks** for *quality* (like MMLU, SWE-bench), a systematic cost-benchmark for typical tasks could make optimization easier.

### On the cache metrics you mentioned
- **Cache miss goes down by ~50%.** That means fewer tokens had to be fully recomputed from scratch — saving compute.  
- **Cache hit is slightly more than half.** So some portion of requests benefited from reusing precomputed activations.  
- **Output tokens dropped by ~⅔.** So the responses were also shorter, leading to major cost reduction because output is often more expensive per token than input.  

This triple effect (better caching, fewer tokens, shorter answers) can create *non-linear* cost differences versus what headline pricing suggests.

### Your observation with DeepSeek v3.2 pricing
You noticed:  
- "Price drop 50% (advertised)."  
- But when you checked your actual task costs, the reduction wasn’t exactly 50%.  

**Why this happens:**
1. **Headline pricing ≠ Effective cost.**  
   Providers lower “per million tokens" prices, but if your usage pattern is dominated by cache hits or shorter completions, the *marginal* realized savings may be very different.  

2. **Input vs output asymmetry.**  
   Often input tokens are cheaper than output tokens. If DeepSeek dropped input prices by 50% but left output nearly the same, and your workload has long outputs → your costs don’t fall as much.  

3. **Billing granularity & rounding.**  
   Some APIs bill per 1K tokens or 100 tokens (depending on backend implementation). For small tasks, rounding errors can distort total cost differences.  

4. **Cache accounting differences.**  
   Some vendors treat cache hits as *free or discounted*, some charge fractionally. If DeepSeek changed only the *cache miss* rate but your workload is mostly cached already, your effective price reduction is smaller than advertised.

5. **Announcement vs rollout lag.**  
   Sometimes platforms like OpenRouter reflect the *headline price drop* immediately, but the underlying API billing lags until all regions are updated. So “not right after check” could be a propagation issue.

---

### Big picture
- The **core problem** is that effective cost depends on *workload structure* (cache hit patterns, average output length, etc.), while providers only publish *static per-token prices*.  
- That’s why you saw: *advertised price cut ≠ real cost cut*.  
- The industry would benefit from a **benchmark framework for cost-efficiency**, the same way we have quality benchmarks — e.g. running representative task suites through multiple models and reporting *net real-world cost per solved task*.  

---

✅ **So in English summary:**  
You found that even though DeepSeek v3.2 announced a 50% price cut, your actual observed costs didn’t fall by 50%. This discrepancy happens because actual LLM task cost is shaped by caching, input/output distribution, and usage patterns, not just the headline price per token. Without standardized tools to normalize these factors, the industry can’t yet benchmark real cost-to-performance as cleanly as it does for accuracy (MMLU, SWE-bench, etc.).

Would you like me to propose a **prototype methodology** for such a **cost vs performance benchmark**, so you could compare models like DeepSeek, GPT, Claude, etc., in real-world task scenarios instead of just theoretical price-per-token?
