Yes, even young high-earning professionals in Hong Kong—like financial analysts and IT engineers pulling in HK$600,000 to HK$1 million annually—have faced significant struggles with housing affordability over the last two decades (2005–2025). This is largely due to sky-high property prices relative to incomes, substantial downpayment requirements (often 20–50% depending on loan-to-value ratios), and mortgage payments that can eat up 40–60% of monthly take-home pay during peak rate periods. While recent price drops (about 28% from 2021 highs) and slight rate easing have helped a bit, the overall burden remains crushing for many in their 20s and 30s, pushing them toward tiny "nano-flats," subdivided units, or delayed homeownership altogether.

### Salary Context for These Roles
Entry-to-mid-level financial analysts and IT/software engineers typically start around HK$300,000–500,000 per year, but with 3–7 years of experience (common for "young talents"), salaries often hit HK$600,000–800,000, and top performers or seniors can reach HK$1 million or more, including bonuses. For example:
- Financial analysts: Average around HK$540,000–640,000 annually.
- IT engineers/software developers: Similar range, HK$540,000–740,000 for mid-level roles.

These are solid incomes—well above the city median of about HK$504,000 per household—but they don't stretch far in a market where even a modest 40sqm flat costs HK$5–7 million today.

### Housing Affordability Over the Last 20 Years
Hong Kong has consistently ranked as the world's least affordable housing market, with the price-to-income ratio (how many years of gross income it takes to buy a median home) hovering at extreme levels:
- **2005–2010**: Ratio climbed from ~10x to 12x amid post-SARS recovery and low rates, making entry-level buying tough even for dual-income couples.
- **2011–2018**: Peaked at 20x+ during the boom, fueled by speculation and limited supply; young pros often needed family help for downpayments.
- **2019–2021**: Hit a record 23.2x amid pandemic distortions and low rates, exacerbating the "sandwich class" squeeze (middle-income earners priced out of public housing).
- **2022–2025**: Eased to 16.7x thanks to price corrections (down ~28% nominally), but still the highest globally—far above the "severely unaffordable" threshold of 5.1x.

For a single earner at HK$600k–1M, this means a basic flat requires 5–10 years of full income (before downpayment), but real-world factors like stamp duties, agent fees, and maintenance push it higher. Homeownership rates for under-35s are under 10%, with many renting at 30–50% of income or sharing cramped spaces.

### Mortgage Pressures
Mortgages in HK are pegged to HIBOR (Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate) plus a spread (typically 1.3–2%), tracking US Fed moves closely. Over the last 20 years:
- **2005–2008**: Rates ~4–6%, manageable but prices were rising fast.
- **2009–2021**: Rock-bottom at 1–2.5% post-GFC, encouraging debt but inflating bubbles; monthly payments for a HK$5M mortgage (70% LTV) were ~HK$15,000–20,000.
- **2022–2025**: Spiked to 4.5–5.75% with Fed hikes, pushing payments to HK$25,000–30,000 on the same loan—often 40–50% of a HK$50,000 monthly salary. Recent dips to ~3.5–4% (as of Oct 2025) offer relief, but refixing or new loans still sting.

Government caps (e.g., debt-to-income ratio at 50%) help prevent over-borrowing, but they also lock out buyers without big savings. For young talents, this means stretching finances thin, delaying life milestones like marriage or kids, or relying on parental support—issues that worsened during the 2019 protests and COVID but persist today.

In short, yes—it's been a grind for these earners, turning HK's "talent hub" status into a double-edged sword. Recent policy tweaks (like stamp duty cuts) might ease things by 2026, but for now, many are still "priced out" despite strong paychecks.
