### Definition of Idempotent

In mathematics and abstract algebra, an **idempotent** element or operation is one where applying it multiple times to the same input yields the same result as applying it once. Formally, for an operation ⊕, an element \\( A \\) is idempotent if \\( A \oplus A = A \\).

Your example illustrates this with two common operations:
- \\( A \cdot A = A \\): This holds for **multiplication** (or conjunction/AND in boolean algebra), where repeating the operation doesn't change the value.
- \\( A + A = A \\): This holds for **addition** (or disjunction/OR in boolean algebra), which is less intuitive in standard arithmetic (where \\( A + A = 2A \\)) but true in structures like sets (union: \\( A \cup A = A \\)) or boolean logic.

#### How to Verify Idempotence
To check if an element \\( A \\) is idempotent under an operation ⊕:
1. Compute \\( A \oplus A \\).
2. If the result equals \\( A \\), it's idempotent.
3. Repeat for multiple applications (e.g., \\( A \oplus (A \oplus A) \\)), but idempotence implies this stabilizes immediately.

**Examples**:
- **Boolean Algebra**: AND (·) and OR (+) are idempotent operations.
  - True · True = True
  - True + True = True
- **Matrices**: A matrix \\( M \\) is idempotent if \\( M^2 = M \\) (projection matrices).
- **Functions**: A function \\( f \\) is idempotent if \\( f(f(x)) = f(x) \\) (e.g., absolute value: \\( | |x| | = |x| \\)).

This property is key in computer science (e.g., HTTP methods like GET are idempotent) and algebra (idempotent semirings).
