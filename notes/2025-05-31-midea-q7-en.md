The inlet pipe of the Midea Q7 13-set dishwasher uses a **small thread** (external thread, typically a 3/4-inch standard thread). 

Similarly, washing machines typically also use a **small thread** (external thread, generally 3/4-inch standard thread) for their inlet pipes, which is consistent with most dishwasher inlet pipe interfaces. However, specifications may vary slightly depending on the brand or model, so it’s recommended to check the washing machine’s manual or confirm the inlet pipe interface. If your faucet has a large thread, you may need a large-to-small thread adapter.

**How to Set the Program for the Midea Q7 13-Place Dishwasher**

The program settings for the Midea Q7 13-place dishwasher (standalone or built-in model) are typically configured using the control panel's buttons or touchscreen. Below are the general steps to set a program. Please refer to your specific model's user manual, as slight variations may exist:

1. **Power On**:
   - Ensure the dishwasher is connected to a power source and the water supply is turned on.
   - Press the power button (usually labeled “Power” or “ON/OFF”) to start the machine.

2. **Select a Wash Program**:
   - The control panel offers multiple program options, such as “Standard Wash,” “Intensive Wash,” “Eco Wash,” “Quick Wash,” or “Glass Wash.”
   - Use the “Program” or “Mode” button (which may cycle through options or be selected on a touchscreen) to choose the appropriate wash cycle. For example:
     - **Standard Wash**: Suitable for everyday dish cleaning.
     - **Intensive Wash**: For heavily soiled or greasy dishes.
     - **Eco Wash**: For lightly soiled items, saving water and energy.
     - **Quick Wash**: For lightly soiled dishes needing a fast cycle.

3. **Adjust Additional Settings (Optional)**:
   - The Q7 may offer extra features like “High-Temperature Sanitization,” “Extra Rinse,” or “Delay Start.”
   - Press the corresponding function button (e.g., “Sanitize” or “Delay”) to configure. For example:
     - **Delay Start**: Select the delay time (typically 1-24 hours) using “+” or “-” buttons.
     - **High-Temperature Sanitization**: Activate for higher wash temperatures, ideal for sterilizing dishes.

4. **Confirm and Start**:
   - Ensure detergent (tablet or liquid) is placed in the designated dispenser.
   - Check that dishes are properly arranged (avoid stacking, ensure spray arms are unobstructed).
   - Press the “Start/Pause” button to begin the program. The display or indicator lights will show the cycle status.

5. **Notes**:
   - To change a program mid-cycle, you may need to press “Start/Pause” to pause, then select a new program (some programs may not allow mid-cycle changes).
   - **Drainage**: The Q7 automatically drains after the cycle completes, so no manual drain setting is required. Ensure the drain hose is properly installed to avoid leaks.

**Suggestions**:
- If you have the specific model number (e.g., “Midea Q7 RX600”), provide it for more precise instructions.
- If unfamiliar with the control panel, check the program guide inside the dishwasher door or in the user manual.
- For video tutorials or further installation guidance, search Midea’s official support resources or contact their customer service.
