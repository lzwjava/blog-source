title: Fixing Jekyll YAML and File Errors

The output you've provided shows two types of errors:

1.  **YAML Exception:** This indicates an issue with the front matter (the YAML block at the top) of your Markdown files:

      * `/Users/lzwjava/projects/lzwjava.github.io/notes/2025-06-25-company-valuation-comparison-en.md`
      * `/Users/lzwjava/projects/lzwjava.github.io/notes/2025-06-25-top-companies-evolve-en.md`
        The error "did not find expected key while parsing a block mapping at line 2 column 1" suggests that the YAML syntax in these files is incorrect, likely missing a key or having an indentation issue in the front matter.

2.  **`Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /Users/lzwjava/projects/lzwjava.github.io/wandb/debug-internal.log`**: This error indicates that Jekyll is trying to access a file or directory that doesn't exist, specifically `/wandb/debug-internal.log`. This could be a temporary file or a dependency from another tool (like Weights & Biases - `wandb`) that Jekyll is trying to process.

To answer your question on how to let Jekyll ignore some directories, you can use the `exclude` option in your `_config.yml` file.

Here's how to do it:

1.  **Open your `_config.yml` file** (located in the root of your Jekyll project).

2.  **Add or modify the `exclude` directive.** This directive takes an array of paths (files or directories) that Jekyll should ignore during its build process.

    For example, to ignore the `wandb` directory and any other directories you want to exclude, add the following to your `_config.yml`:

    ```yaml
    exclude:
      - wandb/
      - some_other_directory/
      - another_file_to_ignore.md
    ```

    **Important Notes:**

      * Make sure to include the trailing slash (`/`) for directories to ensure all content within them is ignored.
      * Paths are relative to the root of your Jekyll project.

**Addressing your specific errors with `exclude`:**

  * **For the `wandb` directory error:** Adding `wandb/` to your `exclude` list in `_config.yml` should prevent Jekyll from trying to read files within it, resolving the `No such file or directory` error for `wandb/debug-internal.log`.

  * **For the YAML Exception:** The `exclude` directive will not fix the YAML errors in your Markdown files. You need to **manually correct the front matter** in `notes/2025-06-25-company-valuation-comparison-en.md` and `notes/2025-06-25-top-companies-evolve-en.md`.

    **Typical Jekyll Front Matter Structure:**

    ```yaml
    ---
    layout: post
    title: "My Awesome Post"
    date: 2025-07-02 10:00:00 +0800
    categories: [notes, tech]
    tags: [jekyll, markdown]
    ---

    Your content goes here.
    ```

    Double-check the files mentioned in the YAML Exception to ensure they follow this structure, especially concerning indentation and correct key-value pairs. The error "did not find expected key while parsing a block mapping at line 2 column 1" suggests that something is amiss right at the beginning of your front matter, possibly a missing key or an extra space where a key should be.

After making these changes to your `_config.yml` and correcting your Markdown files, try running your Jekyll build or serve command again.
