Common air fryer ingredients include a variety of meats, vegetables, and starches that cook well with the appliance’s hot air circulation. Here’s a breakdown based on popular use and what works effectively:

- **Meats**:
  - **Beef**: Steaks, burgers, meatballs, or strips for stir-fries. Cuts like sirloin or ribeye work well due to their fat content, which keeps them juicy.
  - **Pork**: Chops, tenderloin, bacon, or sausages. Pork’s natural fat helps achieve a crispy exterior.
  - **Chicken**: Wings, drumsticks, thighs, breasts, or nuggets. Skin-on pieces crisp up nicely, while breaded items like tenders are popular.
  - **Seafood**: Shrimp, salmon, or white fish like cod. These cook quickly and benefit from the air fryer’s ability to lock in moisture.

- **Vegetables**:
  - **Colorful Peppers**: Bell peppers (red, yellow, green) roast well, becoming sweet and slightly charred.
  - **Potatoes**: Whole baby potatoes, wedges, or fries (fresh or frozen). They get crispy outside and fluffy inside.
  - **Other Veggies**: Zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, carrots, or asparagus. These develop a nice caramelized edge.

- **Starches**:
  - **Sweet Potatoes**: Cubes or fries, often seasoned for a sweet-savory balance.
  - **Breaded Items**: Mozzarella sticks, onion rings, or homemade breaded veggies/meats.
  - **Grains**: Tofu or tempeh cubes for plant-based options, which crisp up well when marinated.

- **Other Common Ingredients**:
  - **Seasonings**: Olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, or herbs like rosemary and thyme. A light oil coating enhances crispiness.
  - **Batter/Breading**: Panko, breadcrumbs, or flour-based coatings for extra crunch.
  - **Frozen Foods**: Frozen fries, wings, or appetizers like spring rolls, which are air fryer staples for convenience.

Tips: Most ingredients cook best at 350-400°F (175-200°C) for 10-20 minutes, depending on size and thickness. Shake or flip halfway for even cooking. Avoid overcrowding the basket to ensure proper air circulation. If you’re looking for specific recipes or times, let me know what ingredients you’re working with!
