### Overview
Herbert Dingle's *Science at the Crossroads* (1972) is a passionate critique of Einstein's special theory of relativity (STR), arguing that it contains a fundamental logical flaw that renders it physically impossible. Dingle, a physicist and philosopher with decades of experience, frames the book as a warning: science has strayed from empirical rigor into dogmatic acceptance of unproven theories, risking ethical collapse and even catastrophic real-world consequences from unchecked high-energy experiments. Drawing on his 13+ years of failed attempts to publish critiques in journals like *Nature*, the book blends personal anecdotes, historical analysis, and technical arguments to call for a return to scientific humility and open inquiry.

### Key Arguments
Dingle's central claim revolves around what he calls the "clock paradox" (or twin paradox), a symmetry problem in STR:

- **The Core Contradiction**: STR's postulates—(1) the relativity of uniform motion (no absolute rest) and (2) the constant speed of light regardless of source motion—lead to the prediction that two identical clocks in uniform relative motion will each run slower than the other. As Dingle puts it: "According to the special theory of relativity, two similar clocks, A and B, which are in uniform relative motion... work at different rates. The situation is therefore entirely symmetrical... If A works faster than B, B must work faster than A. Since this is impossible, the theory must be false."
  
- **Why It Matters**: This isn't resolvable by acceleration or reference frames (as some defenders claim); it's a baked-in asymmetry without justification. Dingle demands: "How is the slower-working clock distinguished?" He dismisses "proofs" like muon decay or cosmic ray data as circular, assuming STR's validity to "confirm" it.

The book divides into ethical and technical sections:

- **Ethical Critique (Part One)**: Dingle documents rejections from scientific elites (e.g., P.M.S. Blackett, Lawrence Bragg) who dismissed his work without engaging it, prioritizing consensus over evidence. He accuses the community of violating principles like those of Sir Henry Dale: science should pursue "objective truth... not tolerating any lapse from precision or neglect of any anomaly." This evasion, he argues, mirrors pre-WWII dogmatism, eroding science's moral authority.

- **Technical and Historical Critique (Part Two)**: 
  - Traces STR's origins to confusions in 19th-century physics (e.g., Michelson-Morley experiment misinterpreted without ether).
  - Highlights four "outstanding errors" in STR's acceptance: (1) mistaking math for physics (equations can't dictate reality); (2) conflating meanings of "time" (eternity vs. clock readings); (3) treating coordinate systems as literal "observers"; (4) literalizing metaphors like length contraction.
  - Contrasts STR with alternatives like Hendrik Lorentz's ether-based theory (physical effects explain observations without paradoxes) or Walther Ritz's emission hypothesis for light.
  - Warns of dangers: Flawed STR underpins particle accelerators; untested light-speed assumptions could lead to disasters.

Dingle evolved from a STR supporter to critic after spotting the paradox in 1955, publishing early challenges in 1957.

### Main Conclusions
STR must be abandoned as demonstrably false—its math is elegant but leads to absurdities like reciprocal time dilation. Science faces a "crossroads": cling to unexamined dogma (the "Fox's road" of complacency) or revive empirical testing (Dale's road of fidelity to anomalies). Without reform, Dingle predicts intellectual and practical catastrophe: "Unless scientists can be awakened... the future of science and civilisation is black indeed." He urges simple tests (e.g., moving light sources or planetary radar) and suspending risky experiments. Ultimately, it's a plea for science to reclaim its role as rational pursuit, not superstition.

The book ends unresolved—Dingle's question went unanswered, and STR remains orthodoxy.
