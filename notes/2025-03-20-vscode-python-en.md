title: Configuring VSCode for Python Debugging
translated: false

---

To resolve the issue where Visual Studio Code (VSCode) complains about "no module named `ibm_db_dbi`" when debugging a Python script, even though the module imports successfully when running `python test_db.py` directly from the command line with Python 3.11.8, follow these steps. This discrepancy typically arises due to differences in the Python environment or configuration between the command line and VSCode's debugger. Here’s how to fix it:

---

### Step 1: Verify the Python Interpreter in VSCode
The most common cause of this issue is that VSCode is using a different Python interpreter than the one used in the command line, where `ibm_db_dbi` is installed.

- **Check the selected interpreter in VSCode:**
  - Look at the bottom-left corner of the VSCode window. It displays the currently selected Python interpreter (e.g., "Python 3.11.8" or a path like `/usr/bin/python3.11`).
  - Click on it to open the interpreter selection menu.

- **Compare with the command line:**
  - In your terminal, run:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
    Ensure it outputs "Python 3.11.8". If you use `python3` instead of `python`, try:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
    Also, find the path to this Python executable:
    ```bash
    which python
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    which python3
    ```
    This might return something like `/usr/local/bin/python3.11`.

- **Select the correct interpreter in VSCode:**
  - If the interpreter shown in VSCode doesn’t match Python 3.11.8 or the path from the command line, select the correct one:
    - In the interpreter selection menu, choose "Python 3.11.8" or the path that matches your command-line Python (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/python3.11`).
    - If it’s not listed, click "Enter interpreter path" and manually enter the path to the Python 3.11.8 executable.

---

### Step 2: Confirm `ibm_db_dbi` is Installed in the Selected Environment
Since the module works when running the script from the command line, it’s likely installed in that Python environment. Verify this matches the VSCode interpreter.

- **Check the module location:**
  - In the terminal, using the same Python executable (e.g., `python` or `/usr/local/bin/python3.11`), run:
    ```bash
    pip show ibm_db_dbi
    ```
    Look at the "Location" field in the output. It might be something like `/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages`. This is where `ibm_db_dbi` is installed.

- **Ensure the VSCode interpreter has the module:**
  - If you selected a different interpreter in Step 1, activate that interpreter in the terminal:
    ```bash
    /path/to/python3.11 -m pip show ibm_db_dbi
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/python3.11` with the path from VSCode. If it returns nothing, install the module:
    ```bash
    /path/to/python3.11 -m pip install ibm_db_dbi
    ```

---

### Step 3: Adjust the Debug Configuration in VSCode
If the interpreter is correct but debugging still fails, the issue might be with VSCode’s debug environment. Modify the `launch.json` file to ensure the debugger uses the same environment as the command line.

- **Open the debug configuration:**
  - Go to the "Run and Debug" view in VSCode (Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D on macOS).
  - Click the gear icon to edit `launch.json`. If it doesn’t exist, VSCode will create one when you start debugging.

- **Edit `launch.json`:**
  - Ensure it includes a configuration for your script. A basic example looks like this:
    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Python: Current File",
                "type": "python",
                "request": "launch",
                "program": "${file}",
                "console": "integratedTerminal"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

- **Set environment variables (if needed):**
  - The `ibm_db_dbi` module, used for IBM DB2 databases, might require environment variables like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or DB2-specific settings to locate shared libraries.
  - In the terminal where `python test_db.py` works, check for relevant variables:
    ```bash
    env | grep -i db2
    ```
    or list all variables:
    ```bash
    env
    ```
    Look for variables like `DB2INSTANCE` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
  - Add these to `launch.json` under the `"env"` key. For example:
    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Python: Current File",
                "type": "python",
                "request": "launch",
                "program": "${file}",
                "console": "integratedTerminal",
                "env": {
                    "LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "/path/to/db2/libraries",
                    "DB2INSTANCE": "db2inst1"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    Replace the values with those from your command-line environment.

- **Set PYTHONPATH (if needed):**
  - If `ibm_db_dbi` is in a non-standard location, ensure the debugger can find it by setting `PYTHONPATH`.
  - From the `pip show ibm_db_dbi` output, note the "Location" (e.g., `/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages`).
  - Add it to `launch.json`:
    ```json
    "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages"
    }
    ```

---

### Step 4: Test and Troubleshoot
- **Run the debugger:**
  - Save `launch.json`, then press F5 or click the green "Start Debugging" button to debug your script.
  - Check the Debug Console for errors. It might show the Python executable being used (e.g., "Starting debug adapter with python executable: /path/to/python").

- **Verify the executable:**
  - If the path in the Debug Console doesn’t match your expected Python 3.11.8, revisit Step 1 to ensure the correct interpreter is selected.

- **Test without debugging:**
  - Run the script without debugging (Ctrl+F5 or "Run Without Debugging"). If this works but debugging fails, the issue is specific to the debug configuration, confirming the need for `launch.json` adjustments.

---

### Final Solution
The root cause is likely that VSCode’s debugger isn’t using the same Python environment or settings as your command-line execution. By ensuring the interpreter matches Python 3.11.8, verifying `ibm_db_dbi` is installed, and configuring `launch.json` with necessary environment variables or `PYTHONPATH`, you can align the environments. Here’s a complete `launch.json` example tailored to your case:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "env": {
                "PYTHONPATH": "/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages",
                "LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "/path/to/db2/libraries"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Adjust the `PYTHONPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` paths based on your `pip show ibm_db_dbi` output and command-line environment. After applying these changes, you should be able to debug your script in VSCode without the "no module named `ibm_db_dbi`" error.

---

Since you’re using Windows and encountering the "no module named `ibm_db_dbi`" error in VSCode’s Python debugger, the issue likely arises because the debugger isn’t using the same Python environment where `ibm_db_dbi` is installed, or it’s missing necessary configuration settings. Below are the steps to resolve this on Windows, ensuring your script runs correctly in VSCode’s debugger.

---

### Step 1: Verify the Python Interpreter in VSCode
The error might occur if VSCode is using a different Python interpreter than the one where `ibm_db_dbi` is installed.

- **Check the current interpreter in VSCode:**
  - Look at the bottom-left corner of the VSCode window. It shows the selected Python interpreter (e.g., "Python 3.11.8" or a path like `C:\Python311\python.exe`).
  - Click it to open the interpreter selection menu.

- **Compare with the command line:**
  - Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and type:
    ```cmd
    python --version
    ```
    This should display the Python version (e.g., "Python 3.11.8"). If `python` doesn’t work, try `py --version` or adjust based on your setup.
  - Find the Python executable’s path:
    ```cmd
    where python
    ```
    This might output something like `C:\Python311\python.exe`.

- **Set the correct interpreter in VSCode:**
  - If the VSCode interpreter doesn’t match the version or path from the command line (e.g., `C:\Python311\python.exe`), select it:
    - In the interpreter menu, pick the matching version (e.g., "Python 3.11.8") or path.
    - If it’s not listed, select "Enter interpreter path" and type the full path (e.g., `C:\Python311\python.exe`).

---

### Step 2: Confirm `ibm_db_dbi` is Installed
Assuming your script works outside VSCode (e.g., via `python test_db.py` in Command Prompt), `ibm_db_dbi` is likely installed in that Python environment. Let’s verify and align it with VSCode.

- **Check where `ibm_db_dbi` is installed:**
  - In Command Prompt, run:
    ```cmd
    pip show ibm_db_dbi
    ```
    Look at the "Location" field (e.g., `C:\Python311\Lib\site-packages`). This is where the module resides.

- **Verify the VSCode interpreter has it:**
  - If you changed the interpreter in Step 1, test it:
    ```cmd
    C:\path\to\python.exe -m pip show ibm_db_dbi
    ```
    Replace `C:\path\to\python.exe` with the VSCode interpreter path. If it shows no output, install the module:
    ```cmd
    C:\path\to\python.exe -m pip install ibm_db_dbi
    ```

---

### Step 3: Configure the Debugger in VSCode
Even with the correct interpreter, the debugger might fail due to environment differences. We’ll adjust the `launch.json` file.

- **Access `launch.json`:**
  - Go to "Run and Debug" (Ctrl+Shift+D) in VSCode.
  - Click the gear icon to open or create `launch.json`.

- **Update `launch.json`:**
  - Add or modify a configuration like this:
    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Python: Current File",
                "type": "python",
                "request": "launch",
                "program": "${file}",
                "console": "integratedTerminal"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

- **Add environment variables (if needed):**
  - The `ibm_db_dbi` module may need DB2-related settings (e.g., `PATH` to DB2 DLLs). Check your command-line environment:
    ```cmd
    set
    ```
    Look for entries like `PATH` (including DB2 paths) or `DB2INSTANCE`.
  - Add them to `launch.json`. Example:
    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Python: Current File",
                "type": "python",
                "request": "launch",
                "program": "${file}",
                "console": "integratedTerminal",
                "env": {
                    "PATH": "C:\\path\\to\\db2\\bin;${env:PATH}",
                    "DB2INSTANCE": "db2inst1"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    Replace `C:\\path\\to\\db2\\bin` and `db2inst1` with values from your system.

- **Set `PYTHONPATH` (if needed):**
  - From the `pip show ibm_db_dbi` output, note the "Location" (e.g., `C:\Python311\Lib\site-packages`).
  - Add it to `launch.json`:
    ```json
    "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "C:\\Python311\\Lib\\site-packages"
    }
    ```

---

### Step 4: Test the Debugger
- Save `launch.json`.
- Press F5 or click "Start Debugging" to run your script in the debugger.
- Check the Debug Console for errors. It may show the Python path used (e.g., `C:\Python311\python.exe`). If it’s wrong, revisit Step 1.
- If debugging fails but running without debugging (Ctrl+F5) works, the issue is in `launch.json`, so double-check the `env` settings.

---

### Complete Example
Here’s a tailored `launch.json` to fix your issue:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "env": {
                "PYTHONPATH": "C:\\Python311\\Lib\\site-packages",
                "PATH": "C:\\path\\to\\db2\\bin;${env:PATH}"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
- Adjust `PYTHONPATH` to match your `pip show ibm_db_dbi` "Location".
- Update `PATH` with any DB2 paths from your command-line `set` output.

---

### Conclusion
The "no module named `ibm_db_dbi`" error occurs because VSCode’s debugger isn’t aligned with the Python environment where the module is installed. By setting the correct interpreter, ensuring `ibm_db_dbi` is available, and configuring `launch.json` with the right environment variables, you’ll resolve the issue and debug successfully in VSCode on Windows.
