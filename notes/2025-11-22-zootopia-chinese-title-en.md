I think you might be asking about **"Zootopia"** (or **"Zootropolis"** in some regions) – the Disney animated film about a city of anthropomorphic animals. The Chinese title is often translated similarly to what you mentioned.

However, let me search to confirm the exact Chinese title and help you find it:Perfect! I found it. **"Feng kuang dong wu cheng"** (疯狂动物城) is the Chinese title for **"Zootopia"** – the Disney animated film about animals living in a modern city.

**How to search for it on YouTube:**

1. **Search in English:** Type "Zootopia" or "Zootropolis"
2. **Search in Chinese:** Type "疯狂动物城" or "feng kuang dong wu cheng"
3. **Search for specific content:** Try:
   - "Zootopia full movie"
   - "Zootopia trailer"
   - "Zootopia Chinese version"
   - "疯狂动物城 完整电影" (full movie in Chinese)

**Note:** The availability depends on your region and YouTube's licensing. In some countries it may only show trailers or clips, not the full film. You might also find it on:
- Disney+ (if available in your region)
- Official Disney channel on YouTube
- Other streaming services like Netflix

Try searching for "疯狂动物城" directly on YouTube – that's the official Chinese title and should give you the best results!
