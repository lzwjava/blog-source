“渐进试戴架” in English is usually called a **progressive lens trial frame** or **progressive trial frame set**.

It is a tool used in optometry and optical shops to let patients try different progressive lenses (multifocal lenses for presbyopia or myopia management). Instead of making a custom pair of glasses immediately, the optician inserts trial lenses into this frame so you can test whether the prescription, corridor length, and comfort are suitable before ordering real glasses.

### What “瞳距 / Tongju” Means

* “瞳距” (pupil distance, abbreviated PD) is the distance between the centers of your two pupils, measured in millimeters.
* It’s very important because progressive lenses need the optical center aligned with your pupils for comfort and clear vision.
* That’s why you see numbers like **52, 54, 58, up to 70 mm**. These are different interpupillary distances.
* For example:

  * 52 mm = small face / narrow PD
  * 62 mm = average adult
  * 70 mm = very wide PD

### How to Buy Wisely

1. **Know your PD (Pupil Distance):**

   * You can measure it at an optician, or some apps and rulers can help.
   * Buy a frame (or lens set) that includes your PD size or is adjustable.

2. **Choose Adjustable Frames if Possible:**

   * Some trial frames let you adjust PD precisely (e.g., 52–70 mm range).
   * This is more flexible than buying a fixed-PD frame.

3. **Lens Size & Corridor:**

   * Progressive lenses differ in corridor length (short corridor for small frames, long corridor for big frames).
   * If you plan to test for reading/computer vs. driving, tell the optician so they pick the right sample lenses.

4. **Quality & Comfort:**

   * Cheap plastic trial frames can be uncomfortable and imprecise.
   * For real testing, opticians use metal or professional trial frames that allow angle/height adjustments.

5. **Where to Buy:**

   * On Amazon, Walmart, or optical suppliers, you’ll usually search for **“progressive trial lens set”**, **“trial frame progressive lenses”**, or **“optometry trial frame PD adjustable”**.

👉 In summary: The number (52–70) is your interpupillary distance. The best choice is an **adjustable trial frame that covers your PD**, rather than buying a fixed one that might not fit you.
