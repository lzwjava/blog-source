Yes, you can absolutely apply for another 1-year single-entry endorsement right away after using the previous one—there's no required waiting period or interval between applications, even if it's just a few months later (like your example of next month, then 3 months after). As long as your Home Return Permit is still valid, you can head to a self-service machine in Guangzhou (or an exit-entry office) and get the new endorsement issued on the spot, typically in minutes.

This applies to the tourism type (G签), and it's the same for both Hong Kong and Macau. Just make sure you're eligible as a local resident.
