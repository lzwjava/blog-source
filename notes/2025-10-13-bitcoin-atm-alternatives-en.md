### Other Bitcoin ATM Options in Hong Kong (2025)

Beyond Localcoin and CoinUnit, Hong Kong has a growing but still concentrated Bitcoin ATM scene, with around 200-250 machines total across operators (per CoinATM Radar data as of October 2025). These alternatives focus on cash-to-crypto buys (HKD notes), with similar high fees (7-10%) driven by operations and compliance. All comply with SFC rules, offer quick QR wallet scans, and require minimal KYC for small amounts. Here's a comparison of the key other providers:

| Operator          | Supported Coins                  | Fees (Buy with HKD)                  | Number of ATMs | Locations Summary                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **CoinHero**     | BTC, ETH, BCH, DOGE             | 8.6% + HKD 100 fixed (BTC/ETH/DOGE); 1% BCH; min. HKD 100 | 50+ in HK (part of 80+ Asia-wide) | Widespread: Causeway Bay (flagship), Aberdeen, Kowloon areas; 24/7 in many spots |
| **HK Bitcoin ATM**| BTC (primarily; some ETH/LTC)  | ~8-10% (dynamic, shown on-screen); flat fees ~HKD 50-100 | 10-15         | Central, Mong Kok, Causeway Bay, Tuen Mun; mostly daytime (11am-midnight) |
| **Nitroswap**    | BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC              | 7-9% + flat HKD 50-80; buy/sell     | 5-10          | New Territories focus: Yuen Long, Tuen Mun; limited hours |

These are smaller networks compared to the big two, so coverage is patchier—best for specific areas like Kowloon or New Territories. CoinHero stands out for Asia-wide scale and OTC options (3% fees for larger trades). For tourists or quick buys, HK Bitcoin ATM's Central/Mong Kok spots are convenient. Always check real-time rates on-site, as blockchain fees are negligible (~HKD 5-10 for ETH/BTC).

If you need P2P alternatives (no ATM), options like Paxful or LocalCoinSwap let you buy via bank transfer/cash meetups with lower fees (1-5%), but less anonymity.
