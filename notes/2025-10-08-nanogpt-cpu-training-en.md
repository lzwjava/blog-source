### Command Breakdown

The full command runs the `train.py` script from the nanoGPT repository using Python 3.11, loading defaults from the Shakespeare character-level dataset configuration, and overriding specific hyperparameters for a smaller, CPU-based training run. Below, I'll explain each component and parameter step by step.

- **python3.11**: Specifies the Python interpreter version (3.11) to execute the script. nanoGPT requires Python 3.8+; this ensures compatibility with recent features.

- **train.py**: The main training script in nanoGPT. It handles data loading, model initialization, the training loop (forward/backward passes, optimization), evaluation, logging, and checkpointing.

- **config/train_shakespeare_char.py**: A configuration file that sets dataset-specific defaults (e.g., `dataset = 'shakespeare_char'`, `vocab_size = 65`, initial learning rate, etc.). It defines the task: training on character-level text from Shakespeare's works. All subsequent `--` flags override values from this config.

#### Override Parameters
These are command-line flags passed to `train.py` via argparse, allowing customization without editing files. They control hardware, training behavior, model architecture, and regularization.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `--device` | `cpu` | Specifies the compute device: `'cpu'` runs everything on the host CPU (slower but no GPU needed). Defaults to `'cuda'` if a GPU is available. Useful for testing or low-resource setups. |
| `--compile` | `False` | Enables/disables PyTorch's `torch.compile()` optimization on the model (introduced in PyTorch 2.0 for faster execution via graph compilation). Set to `False` to avoid compatibility issues (e.g., on older hardware or non-CUDA devices). Defaults to `True`. |
| `--eval_iters` | `20` | Number of forward passes (iterations) to run during evaluation to estimate validation loss. Higher values give more accurate estimates but take longer. Defaults to 200; here it's reduced for quicker checks. |
| `--log_interval` | `1` | Frequency (in iterations) at which to print training loss to the console. Set to 1 for verbose output every step; defaults to 10 for less noise. |
| `--block_size` | `64` | Maximum context length (sequence length) the model can process in one go. Affects memory use and how much history the model "remembers." Defaults to 256 in the config; 64 is smaller for faster training on limited hardware. |
| `--batch_size` | `12` | Number of sequences processed in parallel per training step (batch size). Larger batches use more memory but can speed up training via better GPU/CPU utilization. Defaults to 64; 12 is scaled down for CPU. |
| `--n_layer` | `4` | Number of transformer decoder layers (depth of the network). More layers increase capacity but risk overfitting and require more compute. Defaults to 6; 4 makes a tinier model. |
| `--n_head` | `4` | Number of multi-head attention heads per layer. Controls parallelism in attention computation; must divide evenly into `n_embd`. Defaults to 6; 4 reduces complexity. |
| `--n_embd` | `128` | Dimension of the model's embeddings and hidden states (model width). Larger values increase expressiveness but memory/compute needs. Defaults to 384; 128 creates a very small model (~0.5M parameters). |
| `--max_iters` | `2000` | Total number of training iterations (steps). Each iteration processes one batch. Training stops after this many unless early-stopped. Defaults to 5000; 2000 shortens the run for experimentation. |
| `--lr_decay_iters` | `2000` | Number of iterations over which the learning rate (LR) decays linearly to zero (cosine or linear decay schedule). Matches `max_iters` here for full decay by end. Defaults to 5000; ties decay to total steps. |
| `--dropout` | `0.0` | Dropout probability (fraction of units randomly zeroed during training) for regularization. 0.0 disables it entirely (no regularization), useful for small datasets/models. Defaults to 0.2. |

This setup trains a tiny GPT-2-like model (4 layers, 128-dim) on Shakespeare text for 2000 steps on CPU, with frequent logging and no dropout—ideal for quick prototyping or debugging.
