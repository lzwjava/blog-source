### Expanded List: Top 50 Companies by Revenue Per Employee (RPE)

Expanding on the previous top 10, I've compiled a broader list of the highest RPE across big companies, startups, platforms, and niche players (including adult content like OnlyFans). This draws from the latest 2024-2025 data where available, focusing on verified or estimated figures. True top 50 lists are rare due to private company opacity, but these represent the highest reported RPE globally—often from lean operations in gold trading, REITs, gaming, and AI/content platforms. Small teams drive extremes (e.g., Rajesh Exports with ~4 employees), while large firms cap lower.

Note: RPE = total annual revenue / average employees. Data is fiscal 2024 or TTM 2025; estimates for privates like xAI. Excludes one-person ops for relevance. Sectors: Finance/REITs and trading dominate highs; energy/pharma for scale.

#### Key Insights
- **Outliers**: Firms like Rajesh Exports and VICI skew high due to tiny teams (under 50) in high-margin trading/REITs. These aren't "scalable" like tech but highlight efficiency.
- **Big vs. Small**: Large corps (e.g., Aramco) excel in absolute scale but lag per-employee vs. platforms (OnlyFans, Valve). AI/startups like OpenAI/NVIDIA bridge the gap.
- **Trends 2025**: AI boom boosts NVIDIA/OpenAI; energy volatility aids Aramco/Exxon. Adult platforms (OnlyFans, Aylo) punch above due to user-generated content.
- **Limitations**: Privates (e.g., xAI) estimated; some 2024 data carried forward if no 2025 update. Full top 50 exhaustive lists don't exist publicly, so this synthesizes across sources.
