Here's a comprehensive review of high school physics concepts related to electronics and electricity:

### Electric Charge and Coulomb's Law
- **Electric Charge**: A fundamental property of some subatomic particles, which determines their electromagnetic interaction. Charge is quantized, meaning it comes in discrete amounts.
- **Coulomb's Law**: Describes the electrostatic force between two point charges. The force is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

### Electric Fields
- **Electric Field**: A region of space around a charged particle where another charged particle would experience a force.
- **Electric Field Lines**: Imaginary lines used to visualize the electric field. They originate from positive charges and terminate at negative charges.

### Electric Potential and Potential Energy
- **Electric Potential (Voltage)**: The electric potential energy per unit charge. It is a scalar quantity.
- **Potential Difference**: The work done per unit charge to move a charge from one point to another in an electric field.

### Capacitance and Capacitors
- **Capacitance**: The ability of a system to store an electric charge. Measured in farads (F).
- **Capacitors**: Devices that store electric charge. The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is given by \\( C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d} \\), where \\( \epsilon_0 \\) is the permittivity of free space, \\( A \\) is the area of the plates, and \\( d \\) is the distance between them.

### Electric Current and Resistance
- **Electric Current**: The rate of flow of electric charge, measured in amperes (A).
- **Resistance**: The opposition to the flow of electric current, measured in ohms (Ω).
- **Ohm's Law**: States that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Mathematically, \\( V = IR \\).

### Circuits
- **Series Circuits**: Components are connected end-to-end, sharing the same current.
- **Parallel Circuits**: Components are connected side-by-side, sharing the same voltage.
- **Kirchhoff's Laws**:
  - **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)**: The sum of the voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is zero.
  - **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)**: The sum of the currents entering any junction in a circuit is equal to the sum of the currents leaving that junction.

### Power and Energy
- **Electric Power**: The rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. Measured in watts (W).
- **Power Formula**: \\( P = VI = I^2R = \frac{V^2}{R} \\).
- **Energy**: The capacity to do work. Electrical energy is often measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

### Magnetism and Electromagnetism
- **Magnetic Fields**: Created by moving charges or current-carrying wires.
- **Electromagnetism**: The interaction between electric and magnetic fields. Described by Maxwell's equations.
- **Electromagnetic Induction**: The generation of an electric current in a conductor as it moves through a magnetic field (Faraday's Law).

### Semiconductors and Diodes
- **Semiconductors**: Materials with electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator. Used in electronic devices like transistors and diodes.
- **Diodes**: Electronic components that allow current to flow in one direction only.

### Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC)
- **AC**: Electric current that periodically reverses direction. Used in power distribution due to its efficiency over long distances.
- **DC**: Electric current that flows in one direction. Used in most electronic devices.
