title: Fixing Mistral Nemo Repetition Loops
translated: false
type: note
---

When a model like **Mistral-Nemo** keeps repeating itself, it’s usually a symptom of a **generation loop** — a feedback cycle in the model’s output.
This can happen for several technical reasons:

---

**1. Weak “stopping” signals in the context**
If the prompt or conversation doesn’t give the model a clear signal about when to stop or change topic, it may keep producing similar tokens because that’s the most statistically likely continuation it “sees.”

---

**2. Token-level feedback loops**
Language models predict one token at a time, each prediction based on the tokens so far.
If the recent sequence has high probability of repeating (like `"educational educational"`), the model might fall into a high-confidence repetition loop because each repetition increases the probability of doing it again.

---

**3. Low diversity in decoding settings**
If **temperature** is low (e.g., 0–0.2) and **top-k/top-p** sampling is too restrictive, the model will choose the most likely token every time, reinforcing loops instead of breaking out.
On the other hand, too high temperature can also cause random but still repetitive noise.

---

**4. Prompt artifacts**
If the input text already has partial repetition, the model can “latch onto” it, thinking it’s a stylistic choice or important emphasis — so it mirrors and extends it.

---

**5. Model limitations or fine-tuning bias**
Some open models, especially if fine-tuned on chat-style or synthetic data, may have learned patterns where repetition is overrepresented (for emphasis or reinforcement), making them more prone to this in edge cases.

---

**6. No repetition penalty applied**
Some frameworks (like Hugging Face `transformers`) allow a `repetition_penalty` or `frequency_penalty` to discourage reusing the same tokens.
If these are set to `1.0` (no penalty), the model has no “cost” for repeating.

---

**How to reduce this behavior in Mistral-Nemo**

* Add a **repetition penalty** (1.1–1.3)
* Increase **top-k** (e.g., 50–100) or adjust **top-p** (0.9–0.95)
* Raise **temperature** slightly if too low (0.7–0.9)
* Avoid giving it repeated phrases in the prompt unless necessary
* Provide **clear instructions** or an explicit stop sequence

If you like, I can give you a **step-by-step config example** for Mistral-Nemo that reduces these loops.
That way, you can test directly and see the difference.
