Yes, that quote is indeed attributed to Albert Einstein. The original English version from his 1952 interview (later reprinted in his book *Ideas and Opinions*) reads:

> "Teaching should be such that what is offered is perceived as a valuable gift and not as a hard duty. Never regard study as a duty but as the enviable opportunity to learn to know the liberating influence of beauty in the realm of the spirit for your own personal joy and to the profit of the community to which your later work belongs."

It aligns closely with the Chinese translation you shared, emphasizing education's joyful essence over obligation.
