Russia is the largest country in the world by area, stretching across Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. Covering over 17 million square kilometers, it encompasses a vast range of landscapes, from the Arctic tundra and vast forests (taiga) to expansive steppes and diverse mountainous regions. Bordering numerous countries and having coastlines on three oceans (Arctic, Pacific, and a remote connection to the Atlantic), Russia's geography has played a significant role in its history and development.

The political structure of Russia is a federal semi-presidential republic with a President as the head of state and a Prime Minister as the head of government. The official language is Russian, which is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations. While Russian is the dominant language, the country is home to over 190 ethnic groups speaking more than 100 languages, reflecting its rich and diverse cultural tapestry.

The history of Russia is long and complex, tracing back to the East Slavs and the formation of Kievan Rus'. This early state adopted Orthodox Christianity, heavily influencing Russian culture for centuries. The country endured periods of Mongol rule before the rise of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which gradually unified Russian territories. The Tsardom of Russia was established under Ivan the Terrible, followed by the Russian Empire under the Romanov dynasty, which saw significant expansion and Westernization efforts, particularly under Peter the Great and Catherine the Great. The early 20th century brought the Russian Revolution, the end of the Tsarist regime, and the establishment of the Soviet Union. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian Federation was formed.

Russia possesses a rich cultural heritage with significant contributions to literature, music, ballet, and art. Renowned figures like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Tchaikovsky, and numerous others have left an indelible mark on global culture. Traditional Russian culture often emphasizes community, hospitality, and a deep connection to the land.

Economically, Russia has a mixed market-oriented economy with a strong reliance on its vast natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas exports. It is a leading global energy producer and exporter. While the economy has faced volatility throughout its transition from a centrally-planned system, it has shown resilience to external pressures in recent years. Key sectors include mining, manufacturing, agriculture, and services. The country has a high human development index, but also faces challenges related to income inequality and the need for further economic diversification. The population of Russia was estimated at around 146 million people as of early 2025, making it the most populous country in Europe and the ninth-most populous globally. The majority of the population is ethnic Russian, but significant minority groups contribute to the country's diverse demographic landscape.
