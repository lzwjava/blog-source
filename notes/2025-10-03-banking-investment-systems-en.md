### Typical Financial Projects/Systems in Banking

In the banking and financial services industry, "financial projects" often refer to core banking systems, wealth management platforms, or specialized software for handling investments like mutual funds. These are typically enterprise-level solutions that manage accounts, transactions, compliance, and reporting. Avaloq is a prominent example of a core banking and wealth management platform. I'll break this down step by step, starting with Avaloq, then other common alternatives, and finally those with specific support for China onshore (mainland China, regulated by bodies like CSRC) or offshore (e.g., Hong Kong, Singapore, or QDII/QFII schemes for cross-border funds) mutual funds.

#### 1. **Avaloq Overview**
   - **What it is**: Avaloq is a Swiss-based core banking platform focused on private banking, wealth management, and investment services. It's modular and handles everything from front-office (client onboarding) to back-office (settlement, compliance). It's popular in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia for its flexibility in supporting multi-currency and regulatory requirements.
   - **China Support**: Avaloq has strong capabilities for Asian markets. It supports China onshore mutual funds through integrations with local custodians (e.g., China Securities Depository and Clearing Co.) and handles RMB-denominated products. For offshore (e.g., Hong Kong-based funds), it integrates with global clearing systems like Euroclear or HKEX, and supports QDII (Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor) schemes for outbound investments. Avaloq has clients in Hong Kong and partnerships for mainland China expansion.

#### 2. **Other Typical Financial Projects/Systems in Banking**
Beyond Avaloq, here are some widely used alternatives. These are often deployed as "projects" involving implementation, customization, and integration with legacy systems. Selection depends on the bank's size, focus (retail, investment, or corporate banking), and region.

   - **Temenos (T24/Transact)**:
     - Core banking suite for retail, corporate, and Islamic banking. Highly scalable and cloud-native options available.
     - Global reach: Used by over 3,000 institutions in 150+ countries.
     - Why typical: Handles payments, loans, deposits, and wealth management. Often chosen for digital transformation projects.

   - **Finacle (by Infosys)**:
     - Comprehensive digital banking platform for core operations, mobile banking, and analytics.
     - Popular in emerging markets, including Asia and the Middle East.
     - Why typical: Strong in retail and SME banking; supports API integrations for fintech ecosystems.

   - **Mambu**:
     - Cloud-based, composable banking platform (more modern and agile than legacy systems).
     - Focus: Lending, deposits, and payments; ideal for neobanks or digital-only projects.
     - Why typical: Growing in popularity for quick deployments without heavy customization.

   - **Oracle FLEXCUBE**:
     - Universal banking system for core processing, trade finance, and risk management.
     - Used in large-scale projects for international banks.
     - Why typical: Robust for high-volume transactions and multi-entity operations.

   - **Thought Machine (Vault)**:
     - Cloud-native core banking for personalized products and real-time processing.
     - Emerging choice for innovative banks shifting from monolithic systems.

For wealth management and investment-specific projects (beyond core banking), common ones include:
   - **Charles River IMS (State Street)**: Order management and trading for funds.
   - **SimCorp Dimension**: End-to-end investment management for asset managers.
   - **HiPortfolio (OFC Systems)**: Fund accounting and NAV calculation, popular for mutual funds.

These projects typically involve phases like assessment, migration, testing, and go-live, often costing millions and taking 1-3 years.

#### 3. **Systems with Specific Support for China Onshore or Offshore Mutual Funds**
China's mutual fund market is massive (over RMB 27 trillion AUM as of 2023), with strict regulations from CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) for onshore funds and cross-border rules (e.g., Bond Connect, Stock Connect) for offshore. Systems need to handle RMB settlement, T+1 trading cycles, and compliance with FATCA/CRS reporting. Here are key ones with China focus:

   - **Avaloq (as mentioned)**: Excellent for both. Onshore: Supports CSRC reporting and integration with China Clearing. Offshore: Handles Hong Kong SFC-regulated funds and RQFII (Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor) quotas.

   - **Temenos**:
     - Strong China presence (clients like Bank of China branches). Supports onshore mutual funds via local API gateways and custodians like Bank of Communications. Offshore: Integrates with Hong Kong's CCASS for mutual fund distribution.
     - Why suitable: Custom modules for Asian wealth management, including e-KYC for Chinese clients.

   - **Finastra (formerly Misys)**:
     - Their Fusion Invest platform supports mutual fund processing. In China, it handles onshore fund subscriptions/redemptions and offshore QDII funds (allowing mainland investors to buy foreign assets).
     - Used by banks in Hong Kong and Singapore for China-linked products.

   - **Calypso (now Adenza/ION)**:
     - Trading and post-trade system for derivatives and funds. Supports China onshore via connectivity to SHSE/SZSE exchanges. Offshore: Ideal for Hong Kong-based mutual funds with China exposure (e.g., A-shares access).
     - Why suitable: Real-time risk management for volatile China markets.

   - **SS&C Advent (including Geneva and AXYS)**:
     - Portfolio management and accounting for mutual funds. Strong in offshore China funds (e.g., Hong Kong UCITS-compliant products mirroring onshore). Onshore support through partnerships with local firms like ChinaAMC.
     - Popular for asset managers distributing China-focused ETFs/mutual funds globally.

   - **China-Specific or Localized Solutions**:
     - **Kingdee or UseTrust (Chinese vendors)**: For onshore mutual funds, these handle CSRC compliance, fund registration, and NAV reconciliation. Often used in domestic projects alongside global systems.
     - **Bloomberg AIM or Terminal integrations**: Not a full core system but widely used in projects for real-time China fund data, onshore/offshore pricing, and regulatory filings.
     - **HSBC or Standard Chartered's in-house platforms**: Banks with heavy China exposure (e.g., HSBC's Hexagon) support mutual funds via their global systems, with custom China modules.

#### Key Considerations for China-Focused Projects
- **Regulatory Hurdles**: Onshore requires data localization (under PIPL) and approval from SAFE (State Administration of Foreign Exchange). Offshore (e.g., Hong Kong) is more flexible but needs SFC licensing.
- **Integration Needs**: Systems must connect to CFETS (China Foreign Exchange Trade System) for RMB, or HKMA for offshore.
- **Trends**: With China's opening (e.g., Mutual Recognition of Funds scheme between HK and mainland), projects increasingly emphasize cross-border capabilities. Cloud deployments (e.g., Alibaba Cloud for onshore) are rising.
- **Challenges**: High customization for Chinese characters, holidays, and settlement rules; data security is paramount.

If you're evaluating for a specific project (e.g., implementation in a bank), I recommend checking vendor case studies or consulting firms like Deloitte/Accenture for RFPs. For more details on any of these, let me know your focus area!
