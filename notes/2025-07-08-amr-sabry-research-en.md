Amr Sabry is a prominent academic in the field of Computer Science, currently a Professor at Indiana University's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. He is a member of several research groups at Indiana University, including the Programming Language Group, the Foundations of Computing Group, the Program in Pure and Applied Logic, and the IU Quantum Science and Engineering Center (QSEc).

His extensive academic career includes affiliations with several other institutions prior to Indiana University, such as the University of Oregon (1995-2000), Chalmers University of Technology (1994-1995), Carnegie-Mellon University (1993-1994), Rice University (1989-1993), and Cairo University (1981-1989). He received his education from Rice University and Cairo University, and his academic advisor was Matthias Felleisen.

Amr Sabry's research interests lie primarily in the semantics, logical foundations, and implementations of programming languages. He has made significant contributions to various topics within this domain, including:

* **Continuations and Continuation-Passing Style (CPS):** He has published extensively on the typing, logical foundations, and programming applications of continuations and CPS, including a series of influential papers with Matthias Felleisen on the use of continuations in functional language compilation.
* **Computational Effects and Monads:** His work includes reasoning about monadic effects and staged computation. Notably, with Eugenio Moggi, he provided a definitive answer regarding the correctness of monadic encapsulation of effects using rank-2 polymorphism.
* **Type Theory and Logic Foundations:** His research delves into the theoretical underpinnings of programming languages, encompassing logic foundations and various aspects of type theory, including homotopy type theory.
* **Quantum Computing:** More recently, his research interests have expanded to include programming language models of quantum computing and quantum algorithms. He has authored papers on topics such as Haskell Adiabatic DSL for quantum optimization problems and classical simulation of quantum circuits.
* **Reversible Computation:** He has also explored reversible models of computation and reversible programming.

Amr Sabry is a prolific author with a substantial publication record and a notable h-index, reflecting his impact on the field.
