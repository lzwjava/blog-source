The word **"maojin" (毛巾)** in English is typically translated as **"towel"**—not "carpet."

- **"Bath towel"** – A large towel used after a bath or shower to dry the body.
- **"Hand towel"** – A smaller towel for drying hands.
- **"Face towel"** – A small towel for drying the face.

A **"bath mat"** (浴室脚垫) is the carpet-like item placed on the floor to absorb water after a bath, preventing slips. But **"maojin" itself refers to a towel**, not a mat or carpet.
