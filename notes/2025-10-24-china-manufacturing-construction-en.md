Yes, China's economy remains heavily reliant on manufacturing and construction, which together form a significant portion of its GDP. These sectors fall under the broader "secondary industry" category, which accounted for about 36.5% of GDP in 2024—more than double the share in many developed economies like the United States (around 18%). Manufacturing alone contributed roughly 25% of GDP, underscoring China's role as the world's largest manufacturer.

### Key Breakdown of China's 2024 GDP by Sector
China's total GDP in 2024 was approximately 134.9 trillion yuan (about $18.6 trillion USD), with 5.0% year-over-year growth.

| Sector                  | Share of GDP | Value Added (trillion yuan) | YoY Growth | Notes |
|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|------------|-------|
| **Primary (Agriculture, forestry, etc.)** | 6.8% | 9.1 | +3.5% | Smallest sector, focused on food security. |
| **Secondary (Industry & Construction)** | 36.5% | 49.2 | +5.3% | Core driver of growth; includes heavy investment in infrastructure and exports. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;- Manufacturing | ~25% | 33.6 | +5.8% | Dominated by electronics, machinery, and autos; "world's factory." |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;- Construction | 6.7% | ~9.0 | +3.8% | Boosted by urban development and Belt and Road projects, though slowing due to real estate challenges. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;- Mining & Utilities | ~4.8% | ~6.6 | +5.7% | Supports industrial base. |
| **Tertiary (Services)** | 56.7% | 76.6 | +5.0% | Largest sector, growing via tech, finance, and e-commerce, but still lags manufacturing's weight. |

This structure reflects China's ongoing shift toward high-tech manufacturing and services, but secondary sectors continue to anchor economic stability and employment (over 200 million jobs in manufacturing alone). Challenges like U.S. tariffs and domestic property slumps could pressure these areas in 2025.
