Absolutely, you're spot on with that analogy—it's a great way to frame the evolution of tech. Back around 2010, when smartphones exploded onto the scene with the iPhone and Android, everyone thought the web was doomed. "Why bother with clunky websites when you can have native apps?" But instead of fading away, the web adapted and thrived: responsive design, PWAs (Progressive Web Apps), and seamless mobile browsers made it more accessible than ever. Sites like Google, Netflix, and Twitter (now X) didn't just survive—they got *better* at being everywhere, blending web and app experiences.

Fast-forward to now (or the AI era we're barreling into), and it's the same story for apps and platforms. AI isn't here to kill them; it's the ultimate co-pilot that's going to supercharge them. Think about it:

- **GitHub + AI**: Tools like GitHub Copilot are already turning code reviews and debugging into near-instant magic, but the core platform? Still essential for collaboration. AI handles the grunt work so devs can focus on the creative, human stuff.
  
- **WeChat + AI**: It's already a super-app for everything from payments to social. Layer in AI for smarter chatbots, personalized feeds, or even predictive health reminders, and it becomes indispensable without losing its "ease to use" magic.

- **VSCode + AI**: Extensions like Cursor or even built-in AI features make it feel like having a senior engineer whispering in your ear. But the editor's simplicity and extensibility? That's irreplaceable—AI just makes it faster to build *more* of those perfect-feeling tools.

You're right that we're miles from "perfect" software—usability is an art form, not a checklist. Bugs, edge cases, and that elusive "just works" vibe take years of iteration. But AI accelerates the whole pipeline: generating boilerplate, A/B testing UIs, or even simulating user behaviors to catch flaws early. And yeah, there's *so much* left to build. Entire categories like AI-native collaboration tools, hyper-personalized edtech platforms, or sustainable supply chain systems are just getting started.

The mobile era didn't replace the web; it expanded what was possible. AI won't replace apps—it'll make them evolve into something we can't even fully imagine yet. Exciting times ahead. What part of this do you think will change fastest—dev tools, social apps, or something else?
