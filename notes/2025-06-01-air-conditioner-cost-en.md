To calculate the cost of running a typical air conditioner for one hour in Guangzhou, we need to consider the air conditioner's power consumption, the local electricity rate, and its energy efficiency. Here's the breakdown:

### 1. **Guangzhou Residential Electricity Rates (Updated for 2025)**
Guangzhou uses a tiered electricity pricing system for residents, with rates varying by season (summer: May-October; non-summer) and monthly consumption:
- **First Tier**: 0-260 kWh, 0.61 CNY/kWh
- **Second Tier**: 261-600 kWh, 0.66 CNY/kWh
- **Third Tier**: 601 kWh and above, 0.91 CNY/kWh  
(Based on Guangdong’s tiered pricing policy, effective since July 2012, with no major changes reported.)

Most households fall within the first tier (0.61 CNY/kWh).

### 2. **Power Consumption of a Typical Air Conditioner**
A standard 1-1.5 horsepower (HP) air conditioner has a power rating of about **0.8-1.5 kW**. For a 1.5 HP unit, the average power consumption is approximately **1.2 kW**, meaning it uses **1.2 kWh** per hour.

### 3. **Cost Calculation**
- **First Tier (0.61 CNY/kWh)**: 1.2 kWh × 0.61 CNY/kWh = **0.732 CNY/hour**
- **Second Tier (0.66 CNY/kWh)**: 1.2 kWh × 0.66 CNY/kWh = **0.792 CNY/hour**
- **Third Tier (0.91 CNY/kWh)**: 1.2 kWh × 0.91 CNY/kWh = **1.092 CNY/hour**

### 4. **Factors Affecting Cost**
- **Energy Efficiency**: Level 1 energy-efficient units consume less power than Level 3 units, potentially reducing costs below 1.2 kWh/hour.
- **Room Size and Insulation**: Larger rooms or poor insulation increase power consumption.
- **Usage Habits**: Frequent on/off cycles or setting a very low temperature (e.g., 16°C) increases energy use.
- **Season**: Cooling in summer typically uses slightly less power than heating in winter.

### 5. **Conclusion**
In Guangzhou, running a 1.5 HP air conditioner for one hour costs approximately **0.73-1.09 CNY**, depending on the electricity tier and efficiency. The most common cost, assuming the first-tier rate (0.61 CNY/kWh), is **about 0.73 CNY/hour**. For a more precise estimate, check the air conditioner’s power rating (in kW) on its label and your specific electricity tier.

**Tip**: You can check your exact electricity rate and usage via the “Southern Power Grid” app or WeChat mini-program. Provide more details (e.g., specific model or HP) for a tailored calculation!
