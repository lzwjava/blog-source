### Summary of the Article: "Myopia: A Modern Yet Reversible Disease"

This blog post argues that myopia (nearsightedness) is primarily a modern epidemic driven by environmental factors like excessive near work (e.g., reading and screen time), which can activate genetic predispositions. Unlike traditional views, it posits that myopia isn't just inevitable but can often be prevented or reversed through targeted exercises and lifestyle changes, drawing on principles like hormesis (beneficial adaptation to mild stress).

#### Key Causes of Myopia
- **Genetic and Environmental Mix**: Genetics play a role (e.g., copper deficiency may weaken eye structure), but environment is the trigger. High-carb diets and deficiencies in essential fatty acids or minerals exacerbate it.
- **Near Work as the Culprit**: Prolonged close-up activities cause initial lens spasm (pseudo-myopia), and corrective minus lenses can worsen it by elongating the eyeball (axial myopia), creating a feedback loop.
- **Historical Evidence**:
  - An 1883 study found higher myopia rates among students and merchants (who do more near work) vs. farmers.
  - A 1969 study on Eskimos showed myopia surging after Western schooling began.
  - A 2012 German study reported 50% myopia in university graduates vs. 25% in dropouts.
  - In places like Singapore and Taiwan, over 80% of schoolchildren are myopic.
- **Rising Prevalence**: Myopia has increased 50-100% in the U.S. since 1970 across all ages.
- **Scientific Backing**: The "incremental retinal defocus" theory explains how blurred peripheral vision signals the eye to grow longer, supported by studies on chicks, monkeys, and humans.

#### Prevention Strategies
While not detailed separately, the article implies:
- Limit prolonged near work to avoid triggering genetic risks.
- Avoid over-reliance on full-strength minus lenses, which can accelerate progression.

#### Reversal Methods
The core approach is "active focus," a daily practice to retrain the eyes' adaptability (similar to muscle building via Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demand). It requires patience—improvements may start in weeks but take months or a year.
- **Print Pushing**: For reading/computer work, use plus lenses (if myopia < -2 diopters) or bare eyes. Find the "edge of blur" distance and read just beyond it for 2-4 hours daily. Gradually increase lens strength as vision improves, aiming for 20/20.
- **Distance Activities**: Wear glasses with 0.5 diopter less prescription for everyday tasks like walking or TV to encourage natural focusing.
- **Fixing Double Vision/Ghosting**: Practice fusing images on sharp distant edges (e.g., wires or branches) by concentrating on the clearer one.
- **Balance Eyes**: Patch or wink the stronger eye to strengthen the weaker one.
- It's an evolution of the Bates method but tailored for modern axial myopia, with user success stories shared on the blog.
