Here’s a comprehensive set of interview questions tailored for an **Embodied AI Engineer** role, with strong focus on modern visuomotor policy learning, especially **Diffusion Policy**, **, **RT-2**, **ACT (Action Chunking Transformer)**, and general embodied intelligence technologies.

### General Embodied AI & Robotics Foundation
1. What are the key differences between embodied AI and traditional “disembodied” large language/vision models?
2. Why is sim-to-real transfer significantly harder in embodied AI compared to computer vision or NLP tasks?
3. Compare data requirements and scaling laws you’ve observed in embodied AI versus in LLMs or vision foundation models.
4. How do you think about safety and robustness in real-world robotic deployment (e.g., failure modes, recovery behaviors)?

### Diffusion Policy (UC Berkeley, Chi et al., 2023–2025)
5. Explain the core idea of Diffusion Policy and why diffusion models are particularly well-suited for visuomotor control.
6. Walk through the forward/reverse process when using a diffusion model as a policy. How is action denoising conditioned on visual observations?
7. What are the main advantages of Diffusion Policy over previous imitation-learning baselines (e.g., behavioral cloning with MSE, GCBC, Transformer BC)?
8. Diffusion Policy often uses a U-Net backbone with FiLM conditioning or cross-attention. Compare these two visual conditioning methods in terms of performance and inference speed.
9. How does classifier-free guidance work in Diffusion Policy, and how does it affect exploration vs exploitation at test time?
10. In the 2024–2025 versions, Diffusion Policy has been combined with scene-graph or language conditioning. How would you add high-level language goals to a diffusion policy?
11. What are common failure modes you’ve seen with Diffusion Policy in real-robot deployments and how were they mitigated?

### RT-2 (Google DeepMind, 2023–2024)
12. What is RT-2 and how does it co-fine-tune a vision-language model (PaLI-X / PaLM-E) into a robotic actions?
13. Explain the tokenization scheme used in RT-2 for continuous actions. Why discretize actions into bins?
14. RT-2 claims emergent capabilities (e.g., chain-of-thought reasoning, arithmetic, symbol understanding) transferred to robotics. Have you reproduced or observed these in practice?
15. Compare RT-2 with OpenVLA and Octo. In which scenarios would you prefer RT-2 over the others?
16. How does RT-2 handle long-horizon tasks and multi-task generalization compared to Diffusion Policy or ACT?

### ACT (Action Chunking Transformer, Tony Zhao et al., 2023)
17. What problem does action chunking solve in transformer-based policies, and why is chunking critical for real-time control at 10–50 Hz?
18. Describe the ACT architecture: how are actions chunked, how is the latent target computed, and how is variance modeled?
19. Compare ACT with Diffusion Policy in terms of sample efficiency, inference speed, and success rate on contact-rich tasks.
20. ACT originally used CVAE for latent modeling, later versions use flow-matching or diffusion. What benefits did the newer versions bring?

### Broader Visuomotor Policy Landscape
21. Compare the four major visuomotor policy families in 2024–2025:
   - Transformer sequence models (ACT, Octo)
   - Diffusion Policy family
   - VLA-style models (RT-2, OpenVLA, Octo-Transformer)
   - Flow-matching policies (e.g., MIMo, Aurora)
22. When would you choose flow-matching over diffusion for a real-time robot (e.g., humanoid or mobile manipulator)?
23. How do recent models like Octo (UC Berkeley, 2024) and OpenVLA (Stanford/PMI, 2024) combine strengths of ACT and RT-2?
24. What role do you see foundation models (e.g., embedding actions into the same space as language/image tokens) playing in the next 2–3 years of embodied AI?

### System Design & Engineering Questions
25. Design a full training pipeline for collecting a 100k+ episode real-world dataset for a bimanual mobile manipulator using Diffusion Policy or ACT.
26. How would you make a visuomotor policy run in real-time (≥30 Hz) on an edge GPU (e.g., Jetson Orin) while keeping high success rate?
27. You have a policy that works perfectly in simulation but completely fails on the real robot. Systematic debugging checklist?
28. How would you add force/tactile sensing as additional modalities to an existing vision-only Diffusion Policy or RT-2 model?
29. Explain how you would do fast adaptation (few-shot or zero-shot) to a new object instance or new background using any of these methods.

### Research & Future Directions
30. Where do you think the field of embodied AI will be in 2027—will we have generalist home robots? What is the biggest blocker today?
31. Do you believe the current imitation-learning + internet-scale pre-training paradigm (OpenVLA, Octo, etc.) is sufficient, or do true generalization, or do we still need reinforcement learning or active data collection?

These questions range from foundational knowledge to cutting-edge research details and practical engineering challenges—perfect for mid-to-senior embodied AI engineer or researcher interviews in 2025. Good luck with your interviews!
