Yes, ChatGPT Plus users **can** use the O3 model.

OpenAI provides O3, O4-mini, and O4-mini-high models to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Enterprise accounts.

However, there are usage limits:

* **O3:** 100 messages per week.
* **O4-mini:** 300 messages per day.
* **O4-mini-high:** 100 messages per day.

You can select the O3 model from the model selector at the top of the ChatGPT page. When you reach your usage limit for a particular model, you'll see a pop-up, and you won't be able to select that model until your usage limit resets.

It's worth noting that OpenAI has also released O3-pro, which is an even more capable model designed for highly reliable responses on complex tasks. As of recently, O3-pro is generally available to ChatGPT **Pro** and **Team** users, and to developers via the API, not typically for standard ChatGPT Plus users. However, OpenAI has significantly reduced the costs for O3, which means Plus users are getting better rate limits than before.
