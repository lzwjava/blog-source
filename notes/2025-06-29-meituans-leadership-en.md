Meituan, a leading Chinese technology platform focused on local services such as food delivery, retail, and e-commerce, has a robust leadership structure centered around its founder and key executives, with a history of influential figures driving its growth. Below is a detailed list of current and historical key executives and figures associated with Meituan, including Wang Xing, Mu Rongjun, and Tony Qiu, as well as other significant contributors, both present and past. The list is based on available information from Meituan’s corporate structure, public records, and its evolution since its founding in 2010. Note that providing an exact list of 20–30 individuals is challenging due to limited public data on all current and historical figures, but I’ve compiled as comprehensive a list as possible, focusing on the most prominent names.

19. **Fu Dongping (傅東平)**

### Additional Notes
- **S-team (Senior Leadership Team)**: Meituan’s highest decision-making body currently includes Wang Xing, Mu Rongjun, Wang Puzhong, Chen Shaohui, Zhang Chuan, Chen Liang, Guo Wanhuai, and Li Shubin. This group deliberates on strategy, personnel, and new business development.[](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/7205784/deep-good-text-who-is-managing-meituan-wang-xing-seven)[](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/11759167/in-depth-good-article-who-is-managing-meituan-wang-xing)
- **G-team (Commodity Group)**: A smaller retail-focused group established in October 2021, comprising Wang Xing, Wang Puzhong, Chen Liang, Guo Wanhuai, and Li Shubin, focusing on retail-related decisions.[](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/7205784/deep-good-text-who-is-managing-meituan-wang-xing-seven)[](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/11759167/in-depth-good-article-who-is-managing-meituan-wang-xing)
- **Historical Context**: Meituan’s growth involved sidelining or outlasting competitors and acquired company leaders, such as Zhang Tao of Dianping. Wang Xing’s strategy of efficiency, technology, and horizontal expansion has shaped the executive team’s composition, favoring long-term loyalists.[](https://thebambooworks.com/meituan-prepares-for-overseas-voyage-with-ceo-wang-xing-as-captain/)[](https://cxp.asia/2021/08/24/the-story-of-meituan-chinas-other-super-app/)
- **Limited Information on Additional Executives**: Beyond the listed individuals, Meituan’s public disclosures do not consistently name other senior executives or historical figures in detail. Some sources mention names like Yu Jianlin, Xia Huaxia, and Zhang Jinmao as long-term employees (6–7 years by 2021), but their current roles or contributions are not well-documented.[](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/11759167/in-depth-good-article-who-is-managing-meituan-wang-xing)
- **Tony Qiu’s Role**: As Keeta’s CEO, Tony Qiu is a relatively new figure in Meituan’s public-facing leadership, with sparse biographical details available. His prominence stems from Keeta’s strategic importance in Meituan’s global ambitions.

### Challenges in Meeting the 20–30 Count
The request for 20–30 key people is difficult to fulfill precisely due to Meituan’s centralized leadership structure and limited public disclosure of lower-tier executives. Meituan does not have roles like CTO, CMO, or CPO, consolidating responsibilities under business unit heads. Historical figures are also limited to those involved in early ventures or major acquisitions like Dianping. The 20 individuals listed above cover the most significant current and past contributors based on available data. If more names surface in future reports, they could include additional S-team members or regional leaders for Keeta’s international operations.

### Sources
The information is compiled from various sources, including Meituan’s investor relations, Wikipedia, and news articles, ensuring accuracy and relevance. Key references include:.[](https://meituan.todayir.com/html/board.php)[](https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/meituans-keeta-will-expand-into-uae-qatar-and-kuwait-says-founder-wang-xing/)[](https://equalocean.com/news/2024092921132)
