* **Gemini (gemini.google.com):** Google's Gemini typically does not present a "Cloudflare human check" (like a CAPTCHA or "Verifying you are human" page) when you access it directly through `gemini.google.com`. Google has its own internal mechanisms for bot detection and user verification.

* **Grok (grok.com):** Yes, Grok often utilizes Cloudflare's security measures, including their "Verify you are human" checks. Many users have reported encountering Cloudflare's Turnstile (their CAPTCHA alternative) when trying to access `grok.com`. This is a common way for websites to protect against bots and abuse.
