Eskimo is a mobile app that provides virtual eSIM (embedded SIM) plans for international travel, allowing users to connect to high-speed mobile data in over 130 countries without needing a physical SIM card or paying roaming fees. It's designed for tourists and frequent travelers, offering affordable data packages with features like instant activation via QR code, a free trial for new users, no unused data expiration, and plans that can last up to 2 years—the first of its kind for travel eSIMs.

The app is available on both Android and iOS, with easy setup guides for devices like Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel, and iPhones. Users can purchase data plans directly in the app, track usage, and access 24/7 live chat support. It's praised for simplifying global connectivity while keeping costs low compared to traditional roaming.
