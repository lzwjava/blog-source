Let’s clarify the concept of Sum of Products (SOP) and address your question about why the SOP expression for the function \\( F(A, B, C) \\) is \\( F = A \cdot B' \cdot C + A' \cdot B \cdot C \\) when the function outputs 1 for the input combinations \\((A=1, B=0, C=1)\\) and \\((A=0, B=1, C=1)\\), and why \\( F \neq 2 \\).

### Understanding SOP (Sum of Products)
- **SOP** is a standard form of expressing a Boolean function where the output is 1. It consists of a sum (logical OR) of product terms (logical AND).
- Each product term corresponds to a **minterm**, which is a combination of variables (including their complements) that makes the function output 1.
- For a function \\( F(A, B, C) \\), a minterm is a product of all input variables (or their complements) that evaluates to 1 for a specific input combination.

### Step-by-Step Explanation
The problem states that the function \\( F(A, B, C) \\) outputs 1 for two specific input combinations:
1. \\( (A=1, B=0, C=1) \\)
2. \\( (A=0, B=1, C=1) \\)

We need to derive the SOP expression for \\( F \\).

#### Step 1: Identify the Minterms
- A minterm is a product term where each variable appears exactly once (either uncomplemented or complemented) corresponding to an input combination where the function is 1.
- For \\( (A=1, B=0, C=1) \\):
  - \\( A = 1 \\), so we use \\( A \\).
  - \\( B = 0 \\), so we use \\( B' \\) (the complement of \\( B \\)).
  - \\( C = 1 \\), so we use \\( C \\).
  - The minterm is: \\( A \cdot B' \cdot C \\).
- For \\( (A=0, B=1, C=1) \\):
  - \\( A = 0 \\), so we use \\( A' \\).
  - \\( B = 1 \\), so we use \\( B \\).
  - \\( C = 1 \\), so we use \\( C \\).
  - The minterm is: \\( A' \cdot B \cdot C \\).

#### Step 2: Form the SOP Expression
- In SOP form, the function is the logical OR of all minterms where the function outputs 1.
- Since \\( F = 1 \\) for the two input combinations above, the SOP expression is the sum of the two minterms:
  \\[
  F = A \cdot B' \cdot C + A' \cdot B \cdot C
  \\]

#### Step 3: Verify the Expression
Let’s check if the expression \\( F = A \cdot B' \cdot C + A' \cdot B \cdot C \\) correctly outputs 1 for the given input combinations:
- For \\( (A=1, B=0, C=1) \\):
  - First term: \\( A \cdot B' \cdot C = 1 \cdot (0)' \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \\).
  - Second term: \\( A' \cdot B \cdot C = (1)' \cdot 0 \cdot 1 = 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 1 = 0 \\).
  - \\( F = 1 + 0 = 1 \\). (Correct)
- For \\( (A=0, B=1, C=1) \\):
  - First term: \\( A \cdot B' \cdot C = 0 \cdot (1)' \cdot 1 = 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 1 = 0 \\).
  - Second term: \\( A' \cdot B \cdot C = (0)' \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \\).
  - \\( F = 0 + 1 = 1 \\). (Correct)
- For other combinations (e.g., \\( A=0, B=0, C=0 \\)):
  - First term: \\( A \cdot B' \cdot C = 0 \cdot (0)' \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \\).
  - Second term: \\( A' \cdot B \cdot C = (0)' \cdot 0 \cdot 0 = 1 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 = 0 \\).
  - \\( F = 0 + 0 = 0 \\). (Correct, since the function is not specified to be 1 here)

The expression correctly outputs 1 only for the specified input combinations.

#### Step 4: Addressing the Confusion About \\( F = 2 \\)
Your question suggests that if the function is in SOP form, then \\( F = 2 \\). This seems to stem from a misunderstanding. Let’s clarify:
- In Boolean algebra, the output of a function is either **0 or 1**. The value \\( F = 2 \\) is not possible in standard Boolean logic, as it operates in the binary domain (\{0, 1\}).
- You might be thinking of the **number of minterms** or the **count of input combinations** where \\( F = 1 \\). Here, there are **two minterms** (corresponding to the two input combinations where \\( F = 1 \\)), which could lead to the number 2. However, this does not mean \\( F = 2 \\).
- The SOP expression represents the function’s output, not a numerical count. Each minterm contributes a 1 to the output for its corresponding input combination, and the OR operation combines them to produce the final output (0 or 1).

For example:
- If \\( A=1, B=0, C=1 \\), the function evaluates to 1 (not 2).
- If both minterms were true for some input (which isn’t the case here), the OR operation would still yield 1, because \\( 1 + 1 = 1 \\) in Boolean algebra (where \\( + \\) represents logical OR).

### Final Answer
The SOP expression for the function \\( F(A, B, C) \\) that outputs 1 for the input combinations \\( (A=1, B=0, C=1) \\) and \\( (A=0, B=1, C=1) \\) is correctly given as:
\\[
F = A \cdot B' \cdot C + A' \cdot B \cdot C
\\]
The output of \\( F \\) is always 0 or 1, not 2. The number 2 might reflect the count of minterms (two input combinations where \\( F = 1 \\)), but this does not mean the function outputs 2. In Boolean logic, the function’s output is binary, and the SOP form simply lists the conditions under which \\( F = 1 \\).

If you meant something specific by “F = 2” (e.g., a different context like counting minterms or a non-Boolean function), please provide more details, and I can refine the explanation!
