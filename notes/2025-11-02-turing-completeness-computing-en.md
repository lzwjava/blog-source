### What Does "Turing-Complete" Mean?

In computer science, a system (like a programming language, machine, or computational model) is **Turing-complete** if it has the power to simulate *any* Turing machine. A Turing machine is a theoretical model invented by Alan Turing in 1936—essentially an abstract "computer" that can perform any calculation a real computer can, given unlimited time and memory.

#### Key Idea
- **Turing completeness** means the system can solve *any computable problem*. This includes everything from simple arithmetic to complex algorithms, as long as it's theoretically possible (no magic like solving the halting problem).
- It's not about efficiency or speed—it's about *capability*. A Turing-complete system might be slow or impractical for some tasks, but it can theoretically handle them all.

#### How It Works (Simplified)
A Turing machine has:
- An infinite tape (like memory).
- A read/write head that moves left/right.
- A set of rules for what to do based on symbols it reads.

To be Turing-complete, your system must replicate this behavior. For example:
- It needs **unbounded memory** (or at least the ability to simulate it).
- It needs **conditional branching** (if/else logic) and **loops** (to repeat indefinitely).
- No built-in limits that prevent simulating arbitrary computations.

#### Examples
- **Turing-complete**:
  - Programming languages: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, even Brainfuck (a minimalist language).
  - Machines: Most modern computers, virtual machines like the JVM.
- **Not Turing-complete**:
  - HTML/CSS (no loops or conditionals for general computation).
  - Finite state machines or regular expressions (limited to pattern matching, can't handle arbitrary nesting like balanced parentheses).
  - Excel formulas (bounded by grid size and no true recursion).

#### Why It Matters
This concept defines the baseline for "full-powered" computing. If a language or system is Turing-complete, you can write an interpreter for *any other* Turing-complete system in it. It's foundational for understanding limits of computation (e.g., undecidable problems exist even for Turing-complete systems).
