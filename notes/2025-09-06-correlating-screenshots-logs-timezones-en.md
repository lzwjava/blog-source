title: Correlating Screenshots and Server Logs Across Timezones
translated: false
---

Got it 👍 – you want to **correlate screenshots (from testers uploading into Confluence) with UAT server logs** (generated by Java + log4j/slf4j), and the tricky part is the multiple timezones and timestamps.

Let’s break this down carefully:

---

## 1. What timestamps do you have?

**From the screenshot (Windows):**
- The clock **visible inside the screenshot taskbar** = client machine’s **local time** (system time, in their timezone).
- The file metadata (if you still have it outside Confluence) may show `Created` / `Modified` timestamps = also in that client’s timezone.

**From Confluence:**
- Upload timestamp = when the attachment hit the Confluence server.
- Usually stored/displayed in *server time* or converted to *Confluence user’s profile timezone*.  
(You can check your Confluence profile → Settings → Timezone to confirm what you see.)

**From UAT logs (log4j/slf4j):**
- Timestamps are generated by the **Java process JVM timezone** (commonly set by server OS default, unless overridden).
- Format is determined by your log pattern (e.g. `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSS [thread] ...`). Typically this is JVM local time, not UTC, unless explicitly configured.

---

## 2. Why things won’t line up directly
- Screenshot shows **tester’s local laptop** time.
- Confluence stores **upload time in server/DB timezone**.
- Logs show **Java server’s timezone**.  
These three are not guaranteed to be the same.

---

## 3. Method to reconcile
Here’s how to consistently compare a tester’s screenshot with server logs:

1. **Pick a common time standard – usually UTC**  
   - Convert all relevant timestamps to UTC (Excel, scripting, or by hand).
   - This avoids confusion across timezones.

2. **Check JVM / log timezone**  
   - Confirm in UAT server: `java -Duser.timezone` or check a known log entry vs `date` in Linux.  
   - If logs are not UTC, note offset.

3. **Check Confluence server/Profile timezone**  
   - Verify whether the upload timestamp you see is already adjusted for your profile timezone.
   - Adjust back to raw UTC.

4. **Align with screenshot clock**  
   - If screenshot shows `2024-02-10 13:45` and you know tester was in `Asia/Kolkata (UTC+5:30)`, then that equals `2024-02-10 08:15 UTC`.
   - If logs show an event at `2024-02-10 08:15:23 UTC`, you can match them.

---

## 4. Process Workflow (recommended)

- **Step 1:** Ask testers (or enforce in UAT instructions) to include their **timezone/location** when uploading screenshots, or even better, request them to set system clock correctly.  
- **Step 2:** When checking logs, first convert screenshot timestamp (tester’s local clock) → UTC.  
- **Step 3:** Convert log timestamp → UTC (by applying JVM’s timezone).  
- **Step 4:** Compare.

---

## 5. Example Mapping

- Screenshot: shows `2024-06-01 14:05` (tester in Berlin, UTC+2).  
  → UTC = `2024-06-01 12:05`.  

- Confluence shows upload = `2024-06-01 12:07 UTC`.  
  (makes sense – uploaded within ~2 minutes).  

- UAT log:  
  ```
  2024-06-01 12:05:20,456 INFO UAT-Service [thread-19] ...
  ```
  JVM timezone = UTC.  
  → Perfect match.

---

✅ **Key Point:** You must normalize all timestamps into the same timezone (usually UTC). Windows screenshots show local time. Java logs use JVM timezone. Confluence shows upload time in server or user-profile timezone. Without that normalization, you’ll never align them.

Would you like me to draft a **mini playbook** for your UAT team, so testers know what to capture (like "always note your timezone when uploading screenshots") so correlation with logs is easier?
