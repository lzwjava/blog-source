**Establishment**

DBS Tech India was established in 2016 as DBS Asia Hub 2, the bank’s first offshore technology development center outside Singapore. It was created as a wholly-owned subsidiary with an initial paid-up capital of Rs 70.5 crore to strengthen DBS’s technological capabilities across Asia and support its digital banking strategy. Hyderabad was chosen due to its robust ecosystem for technology innovation and access to a vast talent pool.[](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/dbs-bank-to-set-up-offshore-tech-hub-in-hyderabad/articleshow/52295899.cms)[](https://www.dbs.com/dbstechindia/decode.html)
