### Huawei ADS 4.0: Overview

Huawei's Advanced Driving System (ADS) 4.0, also known as Qiankun ADS 4.0, is the latest version of the company's intelligent driving solution as of September 2025. It represents a major upgrade in autonomous driving technology, focusing on Level 3 (L3) autonomy, enhanced safety, and seamless user experience. Launched on April 22, 2025, in Shanghai, ADS 4.0 builds on previous iterations like ADS 3.0 (released in 2024) by integrating advanced AI, sensor fusion, and vehicle control systems.

#### Key Features and Improvements
- **Autonomy Levels**: Supports L3 highway autonomy, allowing hands-off driving in specific scenarios (e.g., highways) while the driver remains ready to intervene. It includes point-to-point (P2P) navigation, urban/highway Navigation Cruise Assist (NCA), and Valet Parking Drive (VPD) for fully automated parking from space to space.
- **Sensor and Perception Upgrades**: Equipped with three LiDARs, distributed millimeter-wave radars for better detection in adverse weather (rain, fog, dust), and the WEWA architecture for processing data on the MDC 1000 platform powered by Ascend 910B chips. This enables superior edge-case handling, such as sudden pedestrian crossings or faulty traffic lights.
- **Safety and Control**: The XMC digital chassis engine unifies driving intelligence and vehicle control, boosting responsiveness by 10x and coordinating five times more components than traditional systems. It also features multi-dimensional active safety, adaptive slip control, and 6 billion km of cloud-simulated validation.
- **Variants**: Available in four tiers—ADS Base, Pro, Max, and Ultra—with Ultra being the top-end model for full L3 capabilities. A more affordable ADS SE variant skips LiDAR for basic highway NCA and parking.

#### Adoption and Rollout
ADS 4.0 is being integrated into vehicles from partners like Dongfeng (e.g., MHERO M817), Audi, VOYAH (AITO M9 series, with upgrades starting July 2025), Deepal, and GAC Trumpchi. It's designed for mass production, emphasizing industrialization for broader market access in China and potentially beyond.

This system positions Huawei as a leader in China's smart automotive sector, competing with Tesla's FSD and other ADAS solutions by prioritizing reliability in complex urban environments. For the most current details, check Huawei's official site, as OTA updates continue to refine performance.
