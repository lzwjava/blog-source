Jiang Lingyu (Chinese: 蒋凌宇; pinyin: Jiǎng Língyǔ), born in 2003 in Chongqing, China, is widely recognized as one of the world’s top competitive programmers, known online by the handle "jiangly." Starting his competitive programming journey at age 11 in 2014, he has risen to prominence through exceptional performances in major international contests, earning accolades such as a silver medal at Google Code Jam 2022 and a bronze medal at Meta Hacker Cup 2021. Currently a student at Peking University’s School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Jiang has achieved a rare Codeforces rating above 4000, making him one of only two programmers, alongside Gennady Korotkevich ("tourist"), to reach the prestigious "Legendary Grandmaster" tier named after Korotkevich.

### Early Life and Education
Jiang was born in Chongqing and attended the High School Affiliated to Southwest University, where he honed his skills in local and national programming competitions. His early start in competitive programming at age 11 allowed him to build a strong foundation in algorithms and problem-solving. By his teens, he was already competing at a high level, earning a spot on the candidate list for China’s International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) team in 2021. His academic path led him to Peking University, where he continues to balance rigorous studies with competitive programming.

### Competitive Programming Achievements
Jiang’s competitive programming career is marked by consistent excellence across platforms like Codeforces, Google Code Jam, Meta Hacker Cup, and ICPC. Key highlights include:
