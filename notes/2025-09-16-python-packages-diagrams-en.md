Besides Graphviz and NetworkX, several other Python packages and frameworks make it easy to generate graphs and diagrams for software design and architecture:

### 1. **Diagrams as Code (diagrams)**
- A Python package specifically designed for creating architecture diagrams as code.
- Built on top of Graphviz, it provides a simple, declarative way to define cloud system architectures, software components, and workflows.
- Supports a wide range of providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.) and is ideal for documenting software architecture in a codebase.
- [Official documentation](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/) ue202turn0search0

### 2. **Mermaid (via Python wrappers)**
- While Mermaid itself is a JavaScript library, it can be used in Python projects through wrappers or by embedding Mermaid code in documentation (e.g., Markdown, Jupyter notebooks).
- Supports a variety of diagram types, including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and Gantt charts.
- Integrates well with VSCode, GitHub, and other developer tools ue202turn0search0.

### 3. **PyGraphviz**
- A Python interface to the Graphviz graph layout and visualization package.
- Allows for creating, editing, reading, writing, and drawing graphs programmatically.
- Useful for more advanced graph manipulation and visualization 2turn0search6.

### 4. **igraph**
- A high-performance graph library with Python bindings.
- Suitable for large graphs and complex network analysis, though it requires more setup than NetworkX.
- Often used for research and data analysis, but can also be used for visualization ue202turn0search3.

### 5. **Pydot**
- Another interface to Graphviz, similar to PyGraphviz but pure Python.
- Useful for generating and rendering graphs from Python code.

### 6. **Gephi (via Python plugins or export)**
- While Gephi is a standalone Java application, you can export graphs from Python (using NetworkX or igraph) and visualize them in Gephi for more advanced layouts and interactive exploration.

### 7. **PlantUML (via Python wrappers)**
- PlantUML is a text-based diagram tool that can be used in Python projects via wrappers or by generating PlantUML code from Python scripts.
- Supports UML, architecture, and flow diagrams.
