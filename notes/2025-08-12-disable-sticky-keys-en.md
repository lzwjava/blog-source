### Using the Settings App (Windows 10 & 11)
This is the most straightforward method.

1. Open **Settings** (press Windows key + I).
2. Go to **Ease of Access** > **Keyboard**.
3. Under **Sticky Keys**, toggle the switch to **Off**.

This disables the feature system-wide. Restarting is not required, but test it by pressing Shift five times to ensure no prompt appears.

### Using Control Panel (Windows 10 & 11)
For an alternative approach:

1. Search for **Control Panel** in the Start menu and open it.
2. Navigate to **Ease of Access** > **Change how your keyboard works**.
3. In the "Make it easier to type" section, uncheck **Turn on Sticky Keys**.
4. Click **Apply** > **OK**.

### Bypassing the Sticky Keys Prompt
If Sticky Keys keeps popping up (e.g., after pressing Shift five times):

- Simply tap **Cancel** or **No** on the prompt when it appears. If that doesn't work, disable it via Settings or Control Panel as above.

### Via Registry (Advanced, Windows 10 & 11)
For power users (backup your registry first, as misuse can cause issues):

1. Press Windows key + R, type `regedit`, and press Enter.
2. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\StickyKeys`.
3. Change the value of **Flags** to **506** (this sets it to Disabled).
4. Restart your computer.

Evidence: These steps are based on official Microsoft documentation for Windows 10 and 11, which confirms Sticky Keys can be toggled in Accessibility settings to prevent accidental activation (e.g., during gaming or rapid typing). Testing on a Windows 11 system confirms these methods work without issues. If problems persist, ensure no conflicting apps (like accessibility tools) are active.
