### Breaking Down the Phrase

That sentence I used—"It's the flip side of globalization—wealthy nations 'outsource' drudgery while hoarding prestige jobs"—is a way to describe an uneven aspect of global economic integration. Let me unpack it step by step in simple terms:

1. **The "Flip Side" of Globalization**:
   - Globalization means countries and people connect more through trade, travel, and jobs—think cheap iPhones from China or software from India.
   - The "positive" side often gets highlighted: growth, innovation, and opportunities for everyone.
   - But the "flip side" is the hidden inequality: it doesn't benefit everyone equally. Rich countries gain the most, while poorer ones handle the downsides.

2. **"Outsource" Drudgery**:
   - "Outsource" = Sending jobs or tasks to other countries (or immigrants) to cut costs.
   - "Drudgery" = Boring, hard, low-pay work like cleaning houses, factory assembly, or farm labor—stuff that's essential but undervalued.
   - Wealthy nations (like HK/SG, US, or Europe) "outsource" this to places like the Philippines or Mexico. Why? It's cheaper (lower wages, fewer regulations) and lets locals focus on better things. In our earlier example, Filipina domestic workers in HK/SG do the "drudgery" so professionals there can work longer hours.

3. **"Hoarding" Prestige Jobs**:
   - "Hoarding" = Keeping something valuable for yourself, not sharing widely.
   - "Prestige jobs" = High-status, well-paid roles like engineers, IT specialists, bankers, or CEOs—think coding at Google or trading stocks at JPMorgan.
   - Rich countries keep these for their own citizens (or elite immigrants) through top schools, networks, and policies. They attract global talent but gatekeep with visas or high barriers. In HK/SG, locals dominate these roles because of their education systems, while outsiders fill the low-end gaps.

### Why This Matters in the Bigger Picture
This creates a global "division of labor": Poor countries export workers for tough gigs (remittances help their economies), but they miss out on the high-value growth. It's like a factory where one group does the dirty work and another gets the profits. Over time, it widens inequality—e.g., the top 10% of countries capture 80% of global income gains from trade.

If you see it in action, it's why a Singaporean might code apps while a Filipina cleans their home: globalization connects them, but power imbalances decide who does what.
