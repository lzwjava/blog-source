### History and Evolution
TEKsystems traces its roots to 1983, when cousins Steve Bisciotti and Jim Davis founded Aerotek in a Baltimore basement, initially focusing on contract engineering for the aerospace industry. Their vision combined technical staffing with superior customer service, laying the foundation for what would become TEKsystems. As the IT market grew during the internet boom of the early 2000s, Aerotek’s data services and telecommunication divisions merged with Maxim Group to form TEKsystems. By 2000, the company had established itself as a leading provider of full-stack technology services and talent solutions, expanding its global footprint and evolving to meet emerging customer needs. To address growing demand for comprehensive IT services, TEKsystems Global Services (TGS) was formed, offering expertise in areas like cloud migration, agile transformation, and cybersecurity. Today, TEKsystems continues to push boundaries, adapting to market trends and delivering transformative outcomes.[](https://www.teksystems.com/en/who-we-are/the-evolution-of-teksystems)[](https://www.teksystems.com/en-au/who-we-are/the-evolution-of-teksystems)[](https://www.teksystems.com/en-in/who-we-are/the-evolution-of-teksystems)
