## 🔹 Part II: Digital Electronics

---

### **5. Fundamentals of Digital Circuits**

#### a. **Number Systems and Codes**
- **Binary (Base-2)**: Uses digits 0 and 1. Most fundamental to digital systems.
- **Octal (Base-8) and Hexadecimal (Base-16)**: Shortcuts for binary groups (3 or 4 bits).
- **BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal)**: Each decimal digit is represented separately in binary (0000–1001).
- **Gray Code**: Only one bit changes at a time between successive values—used in position encoders.

#### b. **Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates**
- **Boolean Operations**:
  - **AND**: A·B = 1 if both are 1
  - **OR**: A + B = 1 if either is 1
  - **NOT**: 𝑨̅ = inverse of A
- **Derived Gates**:
  - **NAND**, **NOR**, **XOR**, **XNOR**
- **Combinational Logic**: Output depends only on current inputs.
  - Use **truth tables** and **Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps)** for simplification.

#### c. **TTL and CMOS Integrated Circuits**
- **TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic)**:
  - Faster but consumes more power.
  - Logic level 1: ~5V; level 0: ~0V.
- **CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)**:
  - Low power, slower speed, very common in modern ICs.
  - Compatible with wide voltage ranges.

### **6. Combinational Logic Circuits**

#### a. **Analysis and Design**
- Start with a **truth table**.
- Derive a **Boolean expression**.
- Simplify it (using Boolean laws or K-Map).
- Draw the **logic circuit**.

#### b. **Common Modules**
- **Encoders**: Convert 2ⁿ input lines to n-bit output (e.g., 8-to-3 encoder).
- **Decoders**: Opposite of encoder, used in memory address decoding.
- **Multiplexers (MUX)**: Select one of many inputs.
  - E.g., 4-to-1 MUX: 2 select lines, 4 inputs → 1 output.
- **Demultiplexers (DEMUX)**: One input routed to one of many outputs.

#### c. **Hazards**
- **Static Hazard**: Output momentarily changes due to gate delays.
- **Dynamic Hazard**: Multiple glitches in output due to timing mismatch.
- **Elimination**: Use redundant logic or synchronous designs.

### **7. Sequential Logic Circuits**

#### a. **Flip-Flops (FFs)**
- **RS Flip-Flop**: Set-Reset, simple memory.
- **D Flip-Flop**: Data or Delay FF, most common.
- **JK Flip-Flop**: Versatile; avoids invalid state of RS.
- **T Flip-Flop**: Toggles on clock; used in counters.

#### b. **Counters and Shift Registers**
- **Counters**:
  - **Asynchronous (Ripple)**: Clock is passed sequentially; slower.
  - **Synchronous**: All FFs clocked together; faster.
  - Types: Up, Down, Up/Down.
- **Shift Registers**:
  - Store and shift bits serially or in parallel.
  - Types: SISO, SIPO, PISO, PIPO.

#### c. **Sequential Circuit Analysis**
- **State Tables/Diagrams**: Show transitions between states.
- Use FF excitation tables to analyze and design.
- Synchronous is easier to control and debug than asynchronous.

### **8. Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)**

#### a. **Types of PLDs**
- **PAL (Programmable Array Logic)**: Fixed OR, programmable AND.
- **GAL (Generic Array Logic)**: Reprogrammable PAL.
- **FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)**:
  - Highly configurable.
  - Thousands/millions of logic blocks.
  - Used in complex systems like digital signal processing, video processing, etc.

#### b. **Introduction to HDL (VHDL/Verilog)**
- **HDL (Hardware Description Language)**:
  - VHDL: Verbose and strongly typed.
  - Verilog: Compact and C-like syntax.
- Used to model digital systems at various levels (gate, register transfer, behavioral).

#### c. **Logic System Design Examples**
- Example 1: 4-bit binary counter in Verilog.
- Example 2: Simple traffic light controller with FSM (Finite State Machine).
- Example 3: ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) with basic operations.
