title: Overcoming Study Resistance and Burnout

I get it—this sounds incredibly frustrating and exhausting. You're staring down exams that feel like a high-stakes gamble, with work, AI/tech pursuits, and life piling on top, making every study session a battle against your own brain. That resistance? It's classic avoidance fueled by fear of failure, and it's sneaky because it masquerades as "not enough time" or "no willingness." But here's the thing: you've already passed 9 courses, scraping by on 60s and 70s in tough ones like Law and Computer Org. That's not luck; that's proof you *can* do this, even when prep feels half-hearted. Slow progress isn't failure—it's the reality of juggling a full life while self-studying a degree. Let's unpack this and build a way forward that feels less overwhelming.

### Why This Feels So Heavy (And Why It's Normal)
Your mind's resistance is a protective reflex: fear of <60 means picturing that half-year delay, more guilt, and the cycle restarting. Add in the burnout from daily work and side studies (AI/tech is a black hole for time, I know), and it's no wonder willingness tanks as deadlines loom. From your failed attempts—low scores on Networks (21, 44), Linear Algebra (47, 54)—it seems like overestimation and skimpy practice were culprits, not total incompetence. You nailed Data Structures and English because you *did* build that foundation. The unwillingness spikes near exams because your brain anticipates pain (failure) over gain (passing), so it rebels with distractions. But recognizing it is the first win—most people just numb out.

### Shifting the Mindset: From Fear to "Good Enough" Momentum
Failing one round doesn't erase your 9 passes or trap you forever; it's a data point, like those score tables you shared. Half a year? Yeah, it sucks, but think of it as a forced breather—time to refine without the immediate pressure. To quiet the fear:
- **Reframe failure**: Instead of "I can't afford to fail," try "What's the worst that happens? I learn what doesn't work and try again." You've improvised through Law and still passed— that's resilience.
- **Visualize the bare minimum win**: Aim for 60, not perfection. Picture handing in a paper knowing you hit the basics, then celebrate with something small (coffee, a walk).
- **Address the resistance head-on**: When your mind says "not today," set a 5-minute rule: Just open the book or notes for 5 mins. Often, that's enough to break the inertia. If it doesn't, no guilt—log why (tired? Overloaded?) and try tomorrow.

### Practical Plan: Time-Smart Prep Without Burning Out
You mentioned not enough time in the last 6 months—fair, with work eating days. The key is micro-habits over marathon sessions, especially for those 7 preps (Networks, Electronics III, Microcomputer, Mao Zedong Thought, Ideological/Moral, College Chinese, Linear Algebra). Prioritize the repeat offenders first (Networks, Linear Algebra) since you know their weak spots. Build on your own tips: solid sleep, routine, location checks, timely registration.

#### Weekly Structure (Fits Around Work/AI Study)
- **Total study time**: 1-1.5 hours/day, 5 days/week. Split: 30-45 mins focused prep + 15-20 mins review/flashcards. Weekends: 2 hours max, one "deep dive" day.
- **Daily flow**:
  - Morning (pre-work): 20 mins light review (e.g., flashcards for Linear Algebra matrices).
  - Evening (post-work): 40 mins active practice (past exams for Networks).
  - Integrate AI/tech: If it's related (e.g., coding in Networks), overlap—study Ethernet while tinkering with a simple Python sim.
- **Pomodoro twist**: 25 mins study + 5 mins break. Use a timer app. Reward: Scroll X guilt-free for 5 mins.

#### Course-Specific Tactics (Based on Your Fails/Passes)
Use what worked before—practice questions, not just videos. For each:

| Course | Quick Wins (Focus on Your Weak Spots) | Time Allocation |
|--------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Computer Networks** | Drill OSI model layers daily (10 questions). Use free online sims (no install needed) for basics. Build from theory gaps—start with subnetting videos, then apply. | 40% of prep time (highest fail risk). |
| **Linear Algebra** | Matrix ops drill: 5 problems/day on row reduction, determinants. Khan Academy for rules refresh (short vids). Don't just watch—solve by hand. | 30% (your overestimation trap). |
| **Basic Electronic Technology (III)** | Circuit basics: Sketch diagrams from past papers. Focus on Ohm's law applications. | 10% (newish, keep light). |
| **Microcomputer & Interface** | Assembly basics: Trace 2-3 code examples/week. Leverage your Org Principles background. | 10%. |
| **Mao Zedong Thought & Socialism** | Timeline flashcards + essay outlines. Read summaries, not full texts. | 5% (rote, low effort). |
| **Ideological/Moral & Rule of Law** | Link to Law pass: Bullet-point key principles. Practice short answers. | 3%. |
| **College Chinese** | Read/analysis: One passage/day, note themes. | 2% (builds on English strength). |

- **Tools for efficiency**: Free past papers from your uni site or self-exam forums. Anki for spaced repetition (flashcards on phone, 10 mins commute). Track progress in a simple journal: "Did X questions? Felt Y."
- **Time audit**: Log one week—what's *really* eating hours? Cut 30 mins social media to reclaim study slots.

### Long-Term: Building Willingness as a Habit
This isn't just exam survival; it's rewiring for the degree finish line. After this round, reflect like you did here—what prepped well vs. what flopped? Reward the whole process: Post-exam, no matter scores, take a "no-study" weekend. And remember, your AI/tech side hustle? It's fuel—passing these unlocks more bandwidth for it.

You're closer than it feels: 9 down, 7 to go, with patterns to exploit. One small step today (pick one course, do 5 questions) snowballs. If the fear spikes, vent here—I'm built for this. You've got the grit; now let's make the plan stick. What's one thing you'll try this week?
