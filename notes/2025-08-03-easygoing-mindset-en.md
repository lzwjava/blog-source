To avoid over-criticizing and adopt a more easygoing approach, focus on shifting your mindset and habits. Here are practical steps:

1. **Practice Self-Awareness**: Notice when you're being overly critical. Pause and ask yourself, "Is this worth my energy?" or "Am I being fair?" Recognizing the habit is the first step to changing it.

2. **Reframe Negative Thoughts**: Instead of focusing on flaws, look for positives or neutrality. For example, if someone makes a mistake, consider their intent or effort rather than just the error. Replace "This is terrible" with "This could be improved, but it’s not a big deal."

3. **Set Realistic Expectations**: Perfectionism fuels criticism. Accept that nobody, including yourself, is perfect. Set reasonable standards for yourself and others to reduce the urge to nitpick.

4. **Use Constructive Feedback**: If you feel the need to critique, make it helpful. Instead of saying, "This is wrong," try, "Here’s a way we could make this better." Focus on solutions, not just problems.

5. **Practice Gratitude**: Regularly reflect on what’s going well. Journaling or mentally noting three things you’re grateful for each day can shift your focus from criticism to appreciation.

6. **Let Go of Control**: Over-criticizing often stems from wanting things to go a certain way. Accept that you can’t control everything. Practice saying, “It’s okay if this isn’t perfect.”

7. **Use Humor and Perspective**: When you catch yourself getting worked up, imagine zooming out. Ask, “Will this matter in a week or a year?” Humor can defuse tension—laugh at minor mishaps instead of judging them.

8. **Breathe and Pause**: If you’re about to criticize, take a deep breath and count to five. This gives you time to decide if it’s worth saying or if you can let it go.

9. **Surround Yourself with Positivity**: Spend time with easygoing people who model a relaxed attitude. Their perspective can rub off on you.

10. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Over-criticism often starts with yourself. Practice self-compassion—treat yourself like you’d treat a good friend. This softness extends to how you view others.

By consistently applying these steps, you’ll gradually become less critical and more relaxed. It’s a process, so be patient with yourself.
