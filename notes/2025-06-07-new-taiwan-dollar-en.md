The New Taiwan Dollar (TWD), also known as the Taiwanese Dollar, is the official currency of Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China (ROC). Introduced in 1949, it replaced the Old Taiwan Dollar to combat hyperinflation following World War II. Issued by the Central Bank of the Republic of China, the TWD is abbreviated with the symbol "NT$" or simply "$" in Taiwan, occasionally with "TW$" to distinguish it from other dollar-based currencies.

The currency is subdivided into 100 cents, though cent denominations are rarely used in practice. Commonly circulated coins include NT$1, NT$5, NT$10, and NT$50, while banknotes are issued in denominations of NT$100, NT$200, NT$500, NT$1,000, and NT$2,000. The TWD is widely used for all transactions in Taiwan, from daily purchases to international trade, and is one of Asia’s stable currencies, reflecting Taiwan’s robust economy, driven by technology and manufacturing sectors.

Historically, the TWD’s value has been influenced by Taiwan’s export-driven economy and its trade relationships, particularly with the United States and China. Its exchange rate is relatively stable, often fluctuating between 28–32 TWD to 1 USD in recent years. The currency features designs showcasing Taiwan’s culture, history, and natural landmarks, such as the Taipei 101 building and native wildlife.
