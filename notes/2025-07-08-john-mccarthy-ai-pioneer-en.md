John McCarthy was a highly influential American computer scientist and cognitive scientist, widely regarded as one of the founding fathers of artificial intelligence (AI). Born in Boston in 1927, he showed an early aptitude for mathematics, teaching himself college-level math as a teenager. He earned his bachelor's degree from the California Institute of Technology in 1948 and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1951.

McCarthy's contributions to the field of computer science and AI are foundational and extensive:

* **Coined the term "Artificial Intelligence":** In 1955, he proposed and helped organize the historic Dartmouth Conference, where the term "artificial intelligence" was first introduced, marking the official inception of the field.
* **Developed the LISP programming language:** In 1958, he created LISP (LISt Processing), a programming language specifically designed for symbolic computation, which became the language of choice for AI research for decades and remains influential today. LISP introduced concepts like garbage collection and recursion, which are now fundamental to many modern programming languages.
* **Pioneered Time-Sharing Systems:** McCarthy was instrumental in the development of time-sharing, a concept that allowed multiple users to simultaneously access and interact with a single mainframe computer. This revolutionary idea laid the groundwork for modern interactive computing and, eventually, the internet and cloud computing.
* **Focus on Common Sense Reasoning:** A significant aspect of his work in AI involved formalizing common sense knowledge and developing logical systems that could enable computers to reason in a human-like way.
* **Established AI Laboratories:** He founded the first AI research project at MIT in 1958 and later established the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) in 1962, both becoming leading centers for AI research.

Throughout his career, McCarthy received numerous accolades for his groundbreaking work, including the Turing Award (1971), the Kyoto Prize (1988), and the National Medal of Science (1990). He passed away in 2011, leaving a profound and lasting legacy that continues to shape the advancement of AI and computer science.
