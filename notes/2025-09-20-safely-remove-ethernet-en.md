In the image, you are holding what appears to be an **RJ45 connector (also known as an Ethernet plug or crystal head)**. The small tabs on either side are designed to lock the connector in place when it is inserted into an Ethernet port or device.

**You can press the tabs on both sides and gently pull out the cable.**
This will release the connector safely without damaging the plug or the port.

If you are trying to disassemble the connector (for example, to re-crimp the wires), you will need a special network cable crimping tool. Simply pressing the tabs will not allow you to take apart the connector itself.

Let me know if you need further guidance!
