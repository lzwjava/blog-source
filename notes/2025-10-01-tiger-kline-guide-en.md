In the Tiger Trade Global mobile app (latest version 9.4.0.2 as of September 2025), the K-line (candlestick) chart on stock pages displays price data, but does not have built-in trade markers or buy/sell indicators for executed orders (unlike the desktop version, where you can enable order displays via Chart Settings > Trading). However, you can add customizable technical indicators to the K-line chart that analyze price trends and generate buy/sell signals, such as moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD, or Bollinger Bands. These can visually represent bullish/bearish signals on the chart (e.g., crossovers indicating buy/sell points).

If buy/sell signals disappeared after accidental clicks (e.g., toggling indicators off), you may need to re-enable or add them back.

### Steps to Show/Add Buy/Sell Indicators on the K-Line Chart:
1. **Open the App and Select a Stock**:
   - Search for a stock (e.g., AAPL) and tap it to open the detail page.

2. **Access the Chart**:
   - The K-line chart is in the "Chart" or "K-Line" tab (default view on the stock page).
   - Tap the chart area to bring up the toolbar or menu (usually at the top or bottom).

3. **Add Indicators**:
   - Look for an icon shaped like a wrench, gear, or "Edit" (⚙️) on the chart.
   - Tap it to open settings. In the indicator list, select from common buy/sell signal tools like:
     - **Moving Averages (MA)**: Simple/EMA – Buy when fast MA crosses above slow MA; sell on drops.
     - **RSI**: Oscillates 0-100; buy below 30 (oversold), sell above 70 (overbought).
     - **MACD**: Buy on histogram bars turning positive; sell on negative.
     - **Bollinger Bands**: Buy when price touches lower band; sell at upper band.
   - Enable 1-3 indicators at once for clarity. Signals appear as lines, arrows, or overlays on the K-lines.
   - Confirm and apply changes to display them.

4. **Customize or Toggle Off**:
   - To remove/re-enable, revisit the indicator settings and deselect or reselect.
   - The latest 9.4.0.2 update includes K-line indicator supplements for better signal visualization [1][2][3].

If this doesn't match your experience (e.g., no edit icon or indicators not working), ensure the app is updated, as older versions may lack some features. For more on reading K-lines and using indicators for buy/sell timing, refer to Tiger Academy tutorials (e.g., "10. Use technical indicators to determine the best buy and sell prices") [3][2]\ue mancanza without fourth allen. If you're using the desktop/grl Tiger Trade app instead, chart settings allow enabling order markers (anchors with lines for buy/sell levels) under Options > Chart Settings > Trading > Show Orders [4].

For visual examples, search for "Adding Indicators to the K Chart" on Tiger Brokers YouTube or forums. If the issue persists, contact app support via Profile > Help.
