ITMO University (Saint Petersburg University of IT, Mechanics, and Optics) has an exceptional record in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), holding the distinction of being the most successful university in the competition’s history. Below is a summary of their performance based on available information:

- **World Championships**: ITMO University has won the ACM ICPC World Finals a record **seven times** (2004, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017), more than any other university.[](https://news.itmo.ru/en/university_live/achievements/news/6682/)[](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/st-petersburg-university-of-it-mechanics-and-optics-wins-ibm-sponsored-international-collegiate-programming-contest-300463609.html)
- **Consistent Excellence**: ITMO has been a regular finalist, qualifying for the World Finals nearly every year since the early 2000s. Their teams have consistently placed among the top, showcasing sustained dominance in competitive programming.
- **Notable Performances**:
  - **2015 World Finals** (Marrakesh, Morocco): ITMO became the first team to solve all 13 problems in the history of the ICPC, securing the championship.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11730522)
  - **2017 World Finals** (Rapid City, South Dakota): ITMO’s team (Vladimir Smykalov, Ivan Belonogov, and Ilya Zban) won the title by solving 10 out of 12 problems, setting a new record for their seventh championship.[](https://news.itmo.ru/en/university_live/achievements/news/6682/)[](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/st-petersburg-university-of-it-mechanics-and-optics-wins-ibm-sponsored-international-collegiate-programming-contest-300463609.html)[](https://www.acm.org/media-center/2017/may/icpc-2017)
  - **2018 World Finals** (Beijing, China): ITMO finished 9th, solving a competitive number of problems, though not taking the top spot. Their performance remained strong, with a notable early submission for Problem F, earning them the first balloon of the contest.[](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-42nd-association-for-computing-machinery-international-collegiate-programming-contest-acm-icpc-680776111.html)[](https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/moscow-state-university-team-wins-world-finals-of-the-acm-international-collegiate-programming-contest/)
  - **2013 World Finals** (Saint Petersburg, Russia): ITMO won their fourth championship, outpacing strong competitors like the University of Warsaw (2nd place).[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest)
- **Regional Success**: ITMO consistently excels in the Northern Eurasia regional contest, one of the most competitive regions. For instance, in the 2017 Northern Eurasia regional contest, ITMO’s team (Ilya Zban, Ivan Belonogov, and Mikhail Putilin) placed 3rd, qualifying for the World Finals in Beijing.[](https://news.itmo.ru/en/news/7151/)[](https://news.itmo.ru/en/news/7151/null/)[](https://news.itmo.ru/en/university_live/achievements/news/7151/)
- **Training and Legacy**: ITMO’s success is attributed to rigorous training under coaches like Andrey Stankevich, who received the ACM ICPC Senior Coach Award in 2016 for 15 consecutive years of leading teams to the finals. The university also supports other institutions, such as conducting intensive training sessions for ETH Zurich since 2010, enhancing global competitive programming skills.[](https://news.itmo.ru/en/university_live/achievements/news/6682/)[](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/st-petersburg-university-of-it-mechanics-and-optics-wins-ibm-sponsored-international-collegiate-programming-contest-300463609.html)[](https://en.itmo.ru/en/viewjrp/2/Annual_training_of_Swiss_Universities_teams_for_ICPC_Programming_Contest.htm)
- **Notable Alumni**: ITMO has produced legendary programmers like Nikolai Durov and Andrey Lopatin, two-time world champions who later became key developers for VK and Telegram.[](https://lr.news.itmo.ru/icpc_guide)
- **Global Impact**: ITMO’s teams have been recognized by industry leaders and even heads of state, with their achievements celebrated at events like the ACM Awards Ceremony. Their consistent participation and victories have contributed to Russia’s strong presence in the ICPC, often alongside other top universities like Moscow State University and the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.[](https://code.fandom.com/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest)[](https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/moscow-state-university-team-wins-world-finals-of-the-acm-international-collegiate-programming-contest/)

**Comparison with University of Warsaw**: While the University of Warsaw has an impressive record with two world championships (2003, 2007) and consistent World Finals qualifications, ITMO’s seven championships and unmatched record of solving all problems in 2015 make them the more dominant force historically. However, both universities are among the elite, with Warsaw’s consistent medal wins (e.g., gold in 2017 and 2019, silver in 2016) and ITMO’s frequent top finishes showcasing their rivalry in the European and global competitive programming scene.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest)[](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/st-petersburg-university-of-it-mechanics-and-optics-wins-ibm-sponsored-international-collegiate-programming-contest-300463609.html)

ITMO’s unparalleled success, driven by rigorous training, exceptional talent, and strategic coaching, cements its status as a global leader in the ACM ICPC.[](https://lr.news.itmo.ru/icpc_guide)[](https://news.itmo.ru/en/university_live/achievements/news/6682/)
