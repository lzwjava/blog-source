June Huh’s story is one of resilience, unconventional paths, and the power of curiosity. Born in 1983 in California to academic parents (his father a statistics professor, his mother a Russian language professor), Huh moved to South Korea at age two. His early years were marked by academic struggles; poor math test scores in elementary school convinced him he lacked mathematical talent, and he found traditional schooling stifling. Bored and disengaged, he dropped out of high school to pursue poetry, a decision that reflected his preference for self-directed exploration over rigid structures.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Huh)[](https://www.quantamagazine.org/june-huh-high-school-dropout-wins-the-fields-medal-20220705/)

Huh’s pivot to mathematics came late, during his sixth year at Seoul National University, where he initially studied physics and astronomy with a poor academic record. A turning point arrived when he enrolled in a course by Heisuke Hironaka, a Fields Medalist visiting professor. Hironaka’s lectures, rooted in real-time research on algebraic geometry, captivated Huh, revealing mathematics as a creative, human endeavor. This encounter, combined with Hironaka’s mentorship, sparked Huh’s passion for math. He followed Hironaka to Japan, serving as a personal assistant while immersing himself in the subject.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Huh)[](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-path-less-taken-to-the-peak-of-the-math-world-20170627/)[](https://plus.maths.org/content/jh)

Despite his unconventional background, Huh faced challenges breaking into academia. His poor undergraduate record led to rejections from most U.S. graduate programs, but he was accepted at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, later transferring to the University of Michigan. There, under Mircea Mustață, he completed his PhD in 2014 at age 31. During his doctoral studies, Huh made a breakthrough by proving the Read conjecture, a 40-year-old problem in graph theory, using novel algebraic geometry methods. This set the stage for his meteoric rise.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Huh)[](https://www.macfound.org/fellows/class-of-2022/june-huh)

Huh’s career skyrocketed. He proved major conjectures, including the Heron–Rota–Welsh and Dowling–Wilson conjectures, by forging unexpected connections between combinatorics and algebraic geometry. His work earned him the 2022 Fields Medal, math’s highest honor, along with a MacArthur Fellowship and other prestigious awards. Now a professor at Princeton, Huh is celebrated for his ability to unify disparate mathematical fields, often approaching problems with a fresh perspective unburdened by conventional boundaries.[](https://www.macfound.org/fellows/class-of-2022/june-huh)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Huh)[](https://plus.maths.org/content/jh)

### Lessons from June Huh’s Journey

1. **It’s Never Too Late to Start**: Huh’s late entry into mathematics—discovering his passion in his mid-20s—shows that talent can emerge at any age. His story encourages persistence, even if you don’t fit the mold of an early prodigy.[](https://photonlines.substack.com/p/lessons-from-june-huh-from-high-school)[](https://plus.maths.org/content/jh)

2. **Embrace Unconventional Paths**: Dropping out of high school and struggling academically didn’t define Huh’s potential. His detour through poetry and journalism enriched his perspective, suggesting that diverse experiences can fuel creativity and innovation.[](https://photonlines.substack.com/p/lessons-from-june-huh-from-high-school)

3. **Curiosity Over Conformity**: Huh thrived by following his interests, not societal expectations. His refusal to force himself into rigid goals allowed him to explore deeply, reminding us to prioritize passion over external pressures.[](https://www.quantamagazine.org/june-huh-high-school-dropout-wins-the-fields-medal-20220705/)[](https://x.com/hardmaru/status/1544594579902844928)

4. **Mentorship Matters**: Hironaka’s guidance was pivotal, offering Huh both inspiration and opportunity. Seeking mentors who challenge and support you can unlock new possibilities.[](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-path-less-taken-to-the-peak-of-the-math-world-20170627/)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/15pyeqg/why_and_how_could_june_huh_rise_to_fame_so_fast/)

5. **Think Differently**: Huh’s breakthroughs came from ignoring traditional mathematical boundaries, applying algebraic geometry to combinatorics in ways others hadn’t. This teaches us to question established frameworks and seek novel approaches.[](https://www.macfound.org/fellows/class-of-2022/june-huh)[](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-path-less-taken-to-the-peak-of-the-math-world-20170627/)

6. **Deliberate Pace Yields Depth**: Huh’s slow, reflective approach—working just three hours daily with intense focus—produced profound insights. Quality, not speed, drives meaningful results.[](https://www.quantamagazine.org/june-huh-high-school-dropout-wins-the-fields-medal-20220705/)

7. **Resilience Through Setbacks**: Despite rejections and self-doubt, Huh persevered. His story underscores the value of resilience, especially for those from less privileged backgrounds who may not have the “luxury” of multiple chances.[](https://www.econjobrumors.com/topic/someone-please-summarize-what-june-huhs-academic-career-teaches-us)[](https://profilesinfo.com/june-huh-wiki-networth-age/)

### Critical Reflection
While Huh’s narrative is inspiring, some argue it’s shaped by privilege—his parents’ academic status likely afforded him second chances, such as admission to Seoul National University despite his record. This raises questions about access and opportunity in academia, where systemic barriers can limit others with similar potential. Still, Huh’s ability to capitalize on opportunities through hard work and originality remains a powerful lesson.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/vs6y0f/june_huh_high_school_dropout_wins_the_fields/)[](https://www.econjobrumors.com/topic/someone-please-summarize-what-june-huhs-academic-career-teaches-us)

Huh’s story teaches us that success doesn’t require a straight path or early brilliance. By embracing curiosity, seeking mentors, and thinking unconventionally, anyone can uncover their potential—though systemic inequities remind us that opportunity isn’t equally distributed.[](https://photonlines.substack.com/p/lessons-from-june-huh-from-high-school)
