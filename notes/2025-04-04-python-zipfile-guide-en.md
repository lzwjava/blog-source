### Overview of the ZipFile Package
Python's `zipfile` module allows you to read from and write to ZIP archive files without external tools. It's part of the standard library, so no installation is needed (from Python 2.3+). Use it for compressing, decompressing, or manipulating ZIP files programmatically. It supports various compression methods like DEFLATE.

Import it with: `import zipfile`

### Reading ZIP Files
To extract or inspect existing ZIP files:

1. **Open a ZIP file for reading**:
   ```python
   with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
       # 'r' is for read mode
   ```

2. **List contents**:
   ```python
   with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
       file_list = zip_ref.namelist()  # Returns list of file names
       print(file_list)
   ```

3. **Extract files**:
   - Extract all: `zip_ref.extractall('destination_folder')`
   - Extract one: `zip_ref.extract('file_inside.zip', 'path')`

4. **Read file content without extracting**:
   ```python
   with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
       with zip_ref.open('file_inside.zip') as file:
           content = file.read()
           print(content.decode())  # If it's text
   ```

Note: Always use `with` for automatic closing. For password-protected ZIPs, add `pwd=b'password'` to `ZipFile()`.

### Writing ZIP Files
To create or add to new/existing ZIP files:

1. **Create a new ZIP file**:
   ```python
   with zipfile.ZipFile('new_archive.zip', 'w') as zip_ref:
       # 'w' is for write mode (overwrites if exists)
   ```

2. **Add files**:
   - Add one: `zip_ref.write('source_file.txt', 'arcname.txt')` (optional arcname renames it inside)
   - Add multiple: Loop over a list of files and call `write()`.

3. **Compress as you write** (default is DEFLATE):
   ```python
   with zipfile.ZipFile('archive.zip', 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zip_ref:
       zip_ref.write('large_file.txt')
   ```
   Options: `ZIP_STORED` (no compression), `ZIP_DEFLATED`, `ZIP_BZIP2`, etc.

4. **Append to existing ZIP** (use 'a' mode instead of 'w').

### Common Operations and Tips
- **Check if a file is a valid ZIP**: Use `zipfile.is_zipfile('file.zip')`.
- **Get file info**: `zip_ref.getinfo('file.txt')` returns a ZipInfo object with details like size, date.
- **Handle large files**: Reading/extracting large files might consume memory; use `open()` method for streaming.
- **Error handling**: Catch `BadZipFile` or `LargeZipFile` exceptions.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, but be mindful of path separators (use `/`).
- **Encryption**: Basic password protection is supported, but it's weak—use stronger tools for security.
- **Higher-level**: For more features (e.g., shutil integration), combine with `shutil.make_archive()` for creating ZIPs.

Example complete script to zip a folder:
```python
import zipfile
import os

def zip_folder(source_dir, zip_path):
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf:
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_dir):
            for file in files:
                zipf.write(os.path.join(root, file),
                           os.path.relpath(os.path.join(root, file), os.path.join(source_dir, '..')))

zip_folder('my_folder', 'output.zip')
```
