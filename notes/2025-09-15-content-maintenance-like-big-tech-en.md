title: Content Maintenance Like Big Tech

Your observation is spot-on! The challenge of **merging, deleting, or simplifying** existing content (or code) is a classic problem that mirrors **legacy system maintenance in big tech**. Here’s why it feels so hard—and how you might approach it systematically, borrowing from software engineering and tech operations best practices:

---

### **Why Deleting/Merging Feels Harder Than Writing New Posts**
1. **Psychological Resistance (Sunk Cost Fallacy)**
   - You’ve already invested time in writing those 400 posts. Deleting or merging them feels like "wasting" effort, even if it’s the right long-term move.
   - *Big Tech Parallel*: Engineers often hesitate to deprecate old features because "someone might still use it" (even if metrics show otherwise).

2. **Fear of Breaking Things**
   - Merging posts might disrupt SEO (broken links, changed URLs), internal linking, or reader expectations.
   - *Big Tech Parallel*: Refactoring legacy code risks introducing bugs in dependent systems. Teams often add "safety nets" (feature flags, canary releases) to mitigate this.

3. **Lack of Clear Metrics**
   - Without data on which posts are valuable (traffic, engagement, conversions), it’s hard to decide what to keep/merge/delete.
   - *Big Tech Parallel*: Legacy systems often lack observability. Teams start by instrumenting metrics before making changes.

4. **No "Ownership" or Process**
   - Unlike writing (which is creative and individual), merging/deleting requires a **systematic approach** (like a codebase cleanup).
   - *Big Tech Parallel*: Large companies assign "tech debt" owners or create dedicated teams (e.g., "Site Reliability Engineers" for infrastructure cleanup).

5. **Tooling Gaps**
   - Most blogging platforms (WordPress, Ghost, etc.) aren’t designed for bulk content operations. You might need custom scripts or plugins.
   - *Big Tech Parallel*: Engineers build internal tools (e.g., Facebook’s "Gatekeeper" for feature flags) to manage complexity.

### **How to Approach This Like a Big Tech Team**
#### **1. Audit Your Content (Like a Codebase Review)**
   - **Inventory**: List all 400 posts with metadata (word count, publish date, traffic, backlinks, social shares).
     - *Tools*: Google Analytics, Ahrefs/SEMrush (for backlinks), or a simple spreadsheet.
   - **Categorize**:
     - **Evergreen**: High-value, timeless content (keep/improve).
     - **Outdated**: Factual errors, old stats (update or merge).
     - **Thin/Redundant**: Short posts that can be combined.
     - **Low-Value**: No traffic, no backlinks (candidate for deletion).
   - *Big Tech Parallel*: "Code audits" where teams label components as "deprecated," "needs refactor," or "critical."

#### **2. Define Merge/Delete Rules (Like Deprecation Policies)**
   - **Merge if**:
     - Posts cover the same topic but are fragmented (e.g., "10 Tips for X" + "5 More Tips for X" → "15 Tips for X").
     - Short posts (<300 words) can be sections in a longer guide.
   - **Delete if**:
     - No traffic in 12+ months + no backlinks.
     - Duplicate content (canonicalize to a better version).
     - Irrelevant to your current audience/niche.
   - *Big Tech Parallel*: API deprecation policies (e.g., "Sunset in 6 months with migration guide").

#### **3. Automate Where Possible (Like DevOps Pipelines)**
   - **Bulk Actions**:
     - Use plugins (e.g., WordPress’s "Bulk Delete") or scripts (Python + CMS API) to handle repetitive tasks.
     - Redirect deleted URLs (301 redirects) to preserve SEO.
   - **Templates**:
     - Create a standard format for merged posts (e.g., "Ultimate Guide to [Topic]").
   - *Big Tech Parallel*: CI/CD pipelines that automate testing/deployment.

#### **4. Phase the Changes (Like Gradual Rollouts)**
   - **Start Small**: Pick 10–20 low-risk posts to merge/delete. Monitor traffic/SEO impact.
   - **Batch Processing**: Tackle 50 posts/month to avoid burnout.
   - **Communicate Changes**:
     - Update internal links.
     - Add notes for readers (e.g., "This post is now part of [New Guide]").
   - *Big Tech Parallel*: Canary releases (rolling out changes to a small % of users first).

#### **5. Track Impact (Like Observability in Systems)**
   - **Metrics to Watch**:
     - Organic traffic (Google Search Console).
     - Backlinks (Ahrefs).
     - User engagement (time on page, bounce rate).
   - **Rollback Plan**: If a merge hurts SEO, revert and iterate.
   - *Big Tech Parallel*: Monitoring dashboards (e.g., Datadog for system health).

#### **6. Document the Process (Like Runbooks)**
   - Create a playbook for future cleanups:
     - Criteria for merging/deleting.
     - Steps for redirects.
     - Tools/scripts used.
   - *Big Tech Parallel*: Internal wikis (e.g., GitLab’s handbook) for repeatable processes.

#### **7. Cultural Shift (Like Tech Debt Prioritization)**
   - **Schedule Regular Cleanups**: Treat it like "spring cleaning"—quarterly or bi-annually.
   - **Involve Others**: If you have a team, assign roles (e.g., "Content Architect").
   - **Celebrate Wins**: Deleting 100 low-value posts is progress!
   - *Big Tech Parallel*: "Hackathons" or "Fix-it Fridays" dedicated to reducing tech debt.

| Task               | Tool/Plugin                          | Big Tech Equivalent          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Content Audit      | Google Analytics, Screaming Frog     | Log analysis (Splunk)        |
| Bulk Edits         | WordPress Bulk Delete, WP All Import | Scripting (Bash/Python)      |
| Redirects          | Redirection (WP plugin)              | URL rewrites (Nginx)         |

### **Key Mindset Shifts**
1. **Delete is a Feature**: Like removing dead code, deleting low-value posts improves maintainability.
2. **Merging ≠ Losing Work**: It’s **repurposing** content for better impact (like refactoring code for performance).
3. **SEO is Long-Term**: Short-term traffic dips may occur, but a cleaner site ranks better over time.
4. **Legacy is Inevitable**: Accept that some content will become outdated—plan for it.

---
### **Example Workflow**
1. **Month 1**: Audit 400 posts → Tag 50 as "merge" and 30 as "delete."
2. **Month 2**: Merge 10 posts into 2 guides; delete 10 with redirects. Monitor traffic.
3. **Month 3**: Automate redirects for deleted posts; merge another batch.
4. **Ongoing**: Schedule quarterly reviews.

### **Final Thought**
Big tech companies don’t avoid legacy—they **manage it systematically**. Your blog is no different. By treating content like a codebase (audit, refactor, test, iterate), you’ll reduce friction and make future cleanups easier.
