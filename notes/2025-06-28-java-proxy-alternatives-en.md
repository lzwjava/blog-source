title: Java Alternatives to Clash-core
translated: false
---

Finding a Java library that directly matches the functionality of **Clash-core**, a rule-based proxy/tunneling library written in Go, is challenging because Clash-core is highly specialized for creating flexible, rule-based VPN/proxy tunnels with support for protocols like Shadowsocks, V2Ray, and Trojan. It operates at the network and application layer, offering features like DNS resolution, TUN mode, and advanced routing rules. No Java library perfectly replicates this exact combination of features, but there are Java-based libraries and tools that provide similar or overlapping functionality for VPN, proxy, or tunneling purposes. Below, I outline some relevant Java libraries and alternatives, and explain their relation to Clash-core.

### Java Libraries with Similar Functionality
1. **Apache HttpClient** (and related Apache Commons Net)
   - **Description**: Apache HttpClient is a robust library for handling HTTP/HTTPS requests, including proxy support (e.g., SOCKS, HTTP proxies). Apache Commons Net provides additional networking utilities, such as support for protocols like FTP, SMTP, and Telnet.
   - **Comparison to Clash-core**: While HttpClient can handle proxy configurations (e.g., routing HTTP traffic through a proxy), it lacks the advanced rule-based routing, protocol support (e.g., VMess, Shadowsocks), and TUN device capabilities of Clash-core. It’s more suited for application-level HTTP proxying rather than system-wide VPN tunneling.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications needing to route HTTP/HTTPS traffic through a proxy server but not for full VPN-like tunneling.

2. **OkHttp**
   - **Description**: OkHttp is a popular Java library for HTTP and HTTPS requests, with support for proxy configurations (e.g., SOCKS5, HTTP proxies). It’s lightweight, efficient, and widely used in Android and Java applications.
   - **Comparison to Clash-core**: Like Apache HttpClient, OkHttp focuses on HTTP-based proxying and lacks the advanced tunneling features (e.g., TUN mode, DNS hijacking, or protocol support like VMess or Trojan) provided by Clash-core. It’s not designed for system-wide VPN functionality but can be used in applications requiring proxy support.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for Java applications needing to route HTTP/HTTPS traffic through a proxy server.

3. **Java VPN Libraries (e.g., OpenVPN Java Client)**
   - **Description**: There are Java-based OpenVPN clients, such as **openvpn-client** (available on GitHub) or libraries like **jopenvpn**, which allow Java applications to interact with OpenVPN servers. These libraries typically wrap OpenVPN functionality or manage VPN connections programmatically.
   - **Comparison to Clash-core**: OpenVPN clients in Java focus on the OpenVPN protocol, which is different from Clash-core’s support for multiple protocols (e.g., Shadowsocks, V2Ray, Trojan). They can establish VPN tunnels but lack Clash-core’s rule-based routing, DNS manipulation, and flexibility with non-standard protocols. OpenVPN is also more heavyweight compared to Clash-core’s lightweight Go implementation.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications needing to connect to OpenVPN servers but not for the flexible, multi-protocol proxying Clash-core offers.
   - **Source**: General knowledge of OpenVPN Java integrations.

4. **WireGuard Java Implementations (e.g., wireguard-java)**
   - **Description**: WireGuard is a modern VPN protocol, and there are Java implementations like **wireguard-java** or libraries that interface with WireGuard (e.g., **com.wireguard.android** for Android). These allow Java applications to establish WireGuard-based VPN tunnels.
   - **Comparison to Clash-core**: WireGuard is a single-protocol VPN solution focused on simplicity and performance, but it doesn’t support the diverse proxy protocols (e.g., Shadowsocks, VMess) or rule-based routing that Clash-core provides. It’s closer to a traditional VPN than Clash-core’s proxy/tunneling approach.
   - **Use Case**: Good for creating VPN tunnels in Java applications, especially for Android, but lacks the advanced routing and protocol flexibility of Clash-core.

5. **Custom Proxy Libraries (e.g., Netty-based Solutions)**
   - **Description**: **Netty** is a high-performance Java networking framework that can be used to build custom proxy servers or clients. Developers can implement SOCKS5, HTTP proxies, or even custom tunneling protocols using Netty’s asynchronous I/O capabilities.
   - **Comparison to Clash-core**: Netty is a low-level framework, so it’s possible to build a Clash-core-like system, but it requires significant custom development. It doesn’t natively support Clash-core’s protocols (e.g., VMess, Trojan) or features like rule-based routing or DNS hijacking out of the box. However, it’s flexible enough to implement similar functionality with effort.
   - **Use Case**: Best for developers willing to build a custom proxy/tunneling solution from scratch.
   - **Source**: General knowledge of Netty’s capabilities in networking.

### Key Differences and Challenges
- **Protocol Support**: Clash-core supports a wide range of proxy protocols (e.g., Shadowsocks, V2Ray, Trojan, Snell), which are not commonly supported by Java libraries. Most Java libraries focus on HTTP/HTTPS, SOCKS, or standard VPN protocols like OpenVPN or WireGuard.
- **Rule-Based Routing**: Clash-core’s strength lies in its YAML-based configuration for fine-grained, rule-based traffic routing (e.g., based on domain, GEOIP, or ports). Java libraries like HttpClient or OkHttp don’t offer this level of routing flexibility natively.
- **TUN Device Support**: Clash-core’s TUN mode allows it to act as a virtual network interface, capturing and routing system-wide traffic. Java libraries generally don’t support TUN devices directly, as this requires low-level system integration (more common in Go or C).
- **DNS Handling**: Clash-core includes built-in DNS resolution and anti-pollution features (e.g., fake IP, DNS hijacking). Java libraries typically rely on the system’s DNS resolver or external configurations, lacking Clash-core’s advanced DNS capabilities.
- **Performance**: Go’s lightweight concurrency model (goroutines) makes Clash-core highly efficient for network-intensive tasks. Java’s threading model is heavier, which may impact performance in similar applications.

### Recommendations
No single Java library directly replicates Clash-core’s functionality, but here are some approaches to achieve similar goals in Java:
1. **Use an Existing Java VPN/Proxy Library**:
   - If you need HTTP/HTTPS proxying, **OkHttp** or **Apache HttpClient** are good starting points for application-level proxying.
   - For VPN-like functionality, explore **WireGuard Java implementations** or **OpenVPN Java clients** for simpler tunneling needs.
2. **Combine Libraries with Custom Logic**:
   - Use **Netty** to build a custom proxy/tunneling solution. You could implement support for protocols like SOCKS5 or HTTP proxies and add rule-based routing logic, though this would require significant development effort.
   - Integrate Java with external tools like Clash-core itself (e.g., via JNI or process execution) to leverage Clash-core’s functionality while controlling it from a Java application.
3. **Consider Alternatives**:
   - If the goal is to replicate Clash-core’s functionality (e.g., for cross-platform proxying), you might consider using Clash-core itself (written in Go) and integrating it with Java via a REST API or command-line interface. Clash-core exposes a RESTful API (e.g., at `127.0.0.1:9090`) for configuration and control, which a Java application could interact with.[](https://kalilinuxtutorials.com/clash/)
   - Alternatively, explore other Go-based libraries like **v2ray-core** or **Xray-core**, which are similar to Clash-core, and integrate them with Java if needed.[](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/Dreamacro/clash)

### Conclusion
There is no direct Java equivalent to Clash-core due to its unique combination of multi-protocol support, rule-based routing, and TUN device capabilities. The closest Java alternatives are **OkHttp** or **Apache HttpClient** for HTTP/HTTPS proxying, **WireGuard Java** or **OpenVPN Java clients** for VPN tunneling, or **Netty** for custom solutions. If you need Clash-core’s exact functionality, consider using Clash-core itself and interfacing with it from Java via its REST API or command-line interface. If you have specific requirements (e.g., a particular protocol or feature), let me know, and I can tailor the recommendation further!
