### What is XGBoost?

XGBoost, short for **eXtreme Gradient Boosting**, is an open-source machine learning library designed for supervised learning tasks, particularly effective for regression, classification, and ranking problems on structured (tabular) data. It implements a gradient boosting framework using decision trees as base learners, where models are built sequentially to correct errors from previous ones, leading to high predictive accuracy.

#### Key Features
- **Scalability**: Optimized for large datasets with parallel processing and distributed computing support (e.g., via Dask or Spark).
- **Performance**: Includes regularization to prevent overfitting, handles missing data natively, and supports custom objectives.
- **Efficiency**: Faster training than traditional gradient boosting due to approximations like weighted quantile sketch for split finding.
- **Versatility**: Integrates with languages like Python, R, Java, and Scala; widely used in Kaggle competitions and industry applications.

XGBoost gained prominence after its release in 2014 and a seminal 2016 paper, becoming a go-to tool for data scientists due to its balance of speed and accuracy.

#### Creator: Tianqi Chen
Tianqi Chen, a prominent researcher in machine learning and systems, developed XGBoost during his time at the University of Washington. He's now an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University (in Machine Learning and Computer Science departments) and works at NVIDIA on AI systems. Chen also co-founded projects like MXNet and TVM, focusing on efficient deep learning frameworks. His work on XGBoost stemmed from research on tree boosting variants combined with conditional random fields.
