### Top Library in Hong Kong for Tech, IT, AI, and STEM

Based on its extensive collections, innovative tools, and alignment with Hong Kong's leading STEM university, the **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) Library** (also known as the Lee Shau Kee Library) stands out as the top choice for tech, IT engineers, AI, and STEM professionals or enthusiasts. HKUST itself is globally ranked among the best for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (e.g., #27 in QS World University Rankings for Engineering & Technology in 2025), making its library a hub for cutting-edge resources.

#### Why HKUST Library is Ideal for Tech/IT/AI/STEM:
- **Massive Digital Collections**: Over 1.8 million e-books, 144,000+ periodicals (print and electronic), 372 specialized databases (e.g., ACM Digital Library for computing, IEEE Xplore for engineering), and 233,000+ streaming media items focused on technical and scientific literature.
- **AI and Research Support**: Hosts workshops, guides, and talks on AI tools for research and discovery. It manages DataSpace@HKUST, a repository for sharing STEM research data, and supports open access publishing—crucial for IT/AI engineers working on projects.
- **Innovative Facilities**: Features a Learning Commons with zones for group study, creative media, and tech experimentation (e.g., early adopter of CD-ROM networks, XML-based discovery tools, and linked data for efficient tech searches). It's equipped for data analysis, coding, and collaborative STEM work.
- **Accessibility**: Open to the public for academic research needs—visitors can apply for a visitor pass online or on-site (free, but requires justification like research purposes). Extended hours during breaks; HKUST affiliates get full access.

Location: Clear Water Bay, Kowloon (accessible via MTR to Choi Hung station, then bus). Website: [HKUST Library](https://library.hkust.edu.hk/).

#### Strong Alternatives
If you're looking for more public-friendly options without university affiliation requirements:

| Library | Key Strengths for Tech/IT/AI/STEM | Public Access | Location |
|---------|----------------------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Hong Kong Central Library** (Main Public Library) | Largest public system with IT workshops (e.g., AI coding sessions), 480+ computer workstations, e-resources like databases and STEM e-books, plus multimedia labs for tech exploration. Great for general IT learning and quiet study. | Fully open to all (free card for borrowing). | Causeway Bay (MTR: Causeway Bay station). |
| **Pao Yue-kong Library (Hong Kong Polytechnic University - PolyU)** | Engineering-focused with tools for data science (Python/R/SQL training), digital scholarship labs, and resources like INSPEC for tech patents. PolyU excels in applied tech/engineering. | Public access with visitor registration (research-focused). | Hung Hom (MTR: Hung Hom station). |
| **CUHK Library (Chinese University of Hong Kong)** | AI Hub with GenAI guidelines, workshops, and e-resources for engineering/AI education. Strong in interdisciplinary STEM. | Limited public access via application. | Sha Tin (MTR: CUHK station). |

For pure public use, start with the Central Library—it's spacious (10+ floors) and hosts regular tech events. University libraries like HKUST offer deeper, specialized depth if you can access them.
