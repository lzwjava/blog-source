title: Furnaces Explained in Different Contexts

“Furnaces” means **large heated devices used for burning, smelting, or heating materials at very high temperatures**.

You’ll see it in different contexts:

**1. Metal / industrial use**
A furnace melts metal, refines steel, or heats materials in factories.

**2. Heating a building**
In some countries, a “furnace” is the central heating system that burns gas or oil to warm air for the house.

**3. Historical / “backyard furnaces” context**
In the Mao-era story you mentioned, “backyard furnaces” were **small, improvised steel-making ovens** built by villagers to produce iron and steel.

If you want, I can explain the “backyard furnace movement” in plainer terms too.
