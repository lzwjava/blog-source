A swimming pool on the top floor of a building could, in theory, act as a shock absorber during an earthquake, but its effectiveness would depend on various factors.

1. **Water's Damping Effect**: Water can absorb some shock and energy due to its mass and the way it moves. However, this would be limited. In the case of a large earthquake, the movement of water could cause significant sloshing, which could actually add to the stress on the building structure rather than reducing it.

2. **Building Design**: Modern high-rise buildings are usually designed with special engineering systems to absorb seismic energy, such as base isolators, tuned mass dampers, or flexible foundations. These systems are much more effective than a swimming pool in absorbing the forces of an earthquake. The pool, on the other hand, is unlikely to be designed for seismic energy absorption, so it might not have the desired effect.

3. **Structural Safety**: The weight of the water and the potential for it to move suddenly during an earthquake could put extra stress on the building's structural integrity. This could lead to potential damage to the building's frame or even the pool itself.

4. **Risk of Sloshing**: During an earthquake, the water could slosh around violently. This could cause not only damage to the pool but also increase the load on the building and lead to structural issues. Some tall buildings with pools have anti-slosh devices to mitigate this, but these aren’t necessarily designed to act as shock absorbers.

In summary, while the pool could theoretically dampen some effects, it wouldn't be as reliable or effective as other seismic safety measures. It's also more likely to pose additional risks. The focus in high-rise buildings tends to be on engineered systems specifically designed to handle seismic forces, rather than relying on the pool for that purpose.
