When measuring wealth by GDP per capita adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), the list changes somewhat. PPP accounts for differences in the cost of living between countries, giving a better indication of comparative living standards. Here are some of the world's richest countries by GDP per capita (PPP):

1. Luxembourg
2. Singapore
3. Qatar
4. Ireland
5. United Arab Emirates
6. Switzerland
7. Norway
8. United States
9. Brunei
10. San Marino
11. Macao SAR
12. Hong Kong SAR

Some interesting patterns emerge when looking at this PPP-adjusted list:

1. Small economies with financial/trade specialization still dominate (Luxembourg, Singapore, Ireland)
2. Resource-rich nations (especially oil/gas) perform better in PPP terms (Qatar, UAE, Brunei)
3. Tax havens and financial centers feature prominently
4. Special administrative regions like Macao and Hong Kong rank higher
5. Several city-states or very small countries appear, suggesting advantages of concentrated economic activity
6. Many have strategic geographic positions for global trade
7. Most maintain relatively open economies
8. Asian countries/regions have stronger representation than in nominal GDP rankings
9. Efficient public services and infrastructure are common across most
10. Most have high levels of human development beyond just economic metrics

The PPP measure gives greater weight to domestic purchasing power, which can elevate countries where local costs for goods and services are lower relative to their economic output.
