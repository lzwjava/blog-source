Ghostty is a cross-platform terminal emulator designed for speed, features, and native integration on macOS and Linux (with Windows support in progress). It's built primarily in **Zig**, a modern systems programming language focused on safety, performance, and simplicity—not Rust, as you asked.

### Key Implementation Details
- **Core Architecture**: The shared core (handling terminal emulation, rendering, and much of the logic) is written in Zig. This allows for low-level control and high performance, including GPU acceleration via Metal (on macOS) or Vulkan/OpenGL (cross-platform).
- **Platform-Specific Layers**: To achieve a native feel, it uses platform toolkits for the GUI:
  - macOS: Swift/AppKit for windowing and UI.
  - Linux: GTK for windowing.
  - Shared rendering pipeline in Zig ties it all together.
- **Notable Features from Its Design**:
  - Blazing-fast startup and rendering (e.g., handles large outputs without lag).
  - Supports ligatures, emoji, and advanced typography.
  - Configurable via Lua scripts for extensibility.
  - No bloat—it's minimalist but packed with essentials like tabs, search, and OSC 52 clipboard integration.
- **Development Philosophy**: Created by Mitchell Hashimoto (of HashiCorp fame), it emphasizes correctness and efficiency over compatibility hacks common in older terminals like xterm. It's open-source under the MIT license.

If you're interested in building or hacking on it, check the GitHub repo for the Zig codebase and build instructions (requires Zig 0.13+).
