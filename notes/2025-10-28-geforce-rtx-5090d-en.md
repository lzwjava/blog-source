**5090D** refers to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090D, a high-end graphics processing unit (GPU) from NVIDIA's Blackwell-based RTX 50-series lineup. It's a variant of the standard RTX 5090, primarily designed for the Chinese market with some hardware tweaks (like a reduced 384-bit memory bus and 24GB of GDDR7 VRAM in the V2 version) to comply with export regulations, while maintaining near-identical gaming performance to the full 5090.

It's definitely a **GPU**, not a motherboard. Custom versions from brands like Galax, Colorful, and ASUS feature unique cooling designs, such as magnetic shrouds or even solid-gold casings for premium editions.
