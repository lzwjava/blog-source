## Using PuTTYgen for SSH Key Authentication

SSH key-based authentication is more secure than password-based authentication. PuTTYgen generates key pairs in PuTTY’s `.ppk` format.

### Step 1: Generate a Key Pair
1. Open **PuTTYgen** from the Start menu or `C:\Program Files\PuTTY\puttygen.exe`.
2. Select a key type (e.g., **RSA**, default, or **ECDSA**) and bit length (e.g., 2048 or 4096 for RSA).
3. Click **Generate** and move your mouse to create randomness until the progress bar completes.
4. Optionally, set a **passphrase** for added security.
5. Save the private key (`.ppk` file) to a secure location.
6. Copy the public key displayed in the “Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file” field.[](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Putty-in-Windows)

### Step 2: Configure the Server
1. Connect to the remote server using password-based authentication (or another method).
2. Create or edit the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:
   - Run `mkdir ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh` to create the `.ssh` directory.
   - Open the `authorized_keys` file with a text editor (e.g., `nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`).
   - Paste the public key and save the file.
   - Set permissions with `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.[](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tutorial/How-to-use-PuTTY-for-SSH-key-based-authentication)
3. Log out of the server.

### Step 3: Configure PuTTY for Key Authentication
1. Open PuTTY and load your saved session.
2. Navigate to **Connection > SSH > Auth > Credentials**.
3. Click **Browse** next to “Private key file for authentication” and select your `.ppk` file.
4. Return to the **Session** category, save the updated session, and click **Open**.
5. Enter your passphrase (if set) when prompted. You should now connect without a password.[](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Putty-in-Windows)

## File Transfers with PSFTP and PSCP

PuTTY includes **PSFTP** (for SFTP) and **PSCP** (for SCP) for secure file transfers.

### Using PSFTP
1. Open **PSFTP** from the Start menu or `C:\Program Files\PuTTY\psftp.exe`.
2. Type `open <hostname>` (e.g., `open students.example.edu`) and press Enter.
3. Log in with your credentials or private key.
4. Use commands like:
   - `ls` or `dir`: List files.
   - `get <filename>`: Download a file.
   - `put <filename>`: Upload a file.
   - `cd <directory>`: Change directory.
   - `quit`: Exit PSFTP.[](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Putty-in-Windows)

### Using PSCP
1. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the PuTTY installation directory (e.g., `cd C:\Program Files\PuTTY`).
3. Run commands like:
   - `pscp <local_file> <username>@<hostname>:<remote_path>` to upload.
   - `pscp <username>@<hostname>:<remote_file> <local_path>` to download.
   - Add `-i <private_key.ppk>` for key-based authentication.[](https://www.tecmint.com/putty-configuration-tips-and-tricks/)

### Note
- PSFTP is interactive, while PSCP is command-line-based.
- For graphical file transfers, consider alternatives like WinSCP, which can import PuTTY sessions.[](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty)

## Port Forwarding and Tunneling

PuTTY supports **SSH tunneling** (port forwarding) to securely access services on remote servers.

### Local Port Forwarding
1. In PuTTY, go to **Connection > SSH > Tunnels**.
2. Enter a **Source port** (e.g., `8080`) on your local machine.
3. Enter the **Destination** (e.g., `remote_host:80`) for the remote service.
4. Select **Local** and click **Add**.
5. Save the session and connect.
6. Access the service locally (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).[](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty/windows)

### Remote Port Forwarding
- Similar to local forwarding, but select **Remote** and specify a port on the remote server to forward to your local machine.

### Dynamic Port Forwarding
- Select **Dynamic** and specify a local port (e.g., `8080`). This creates a SOCKS proxy for dynamic routing (useful for browsing through the server).[](https://rushax.com/what-is-putty-a-comprehensive-guide/)

## X11 Forwarding for Graphical Applications

PuTTY supports **X11 forwarding** to run graphical applications on a remote server and display them locally.

1. Install an X server on Windows (e.g., **XMing**, a free option).
2. In PuTTY, go to **Connection > SSH > X11**.
3. Check **Enable X11 forwarding**.
4. Set **X display location** to `localhost:0.0`.
5. Save the session and connect.
6. Run graphical commands (e.g., `xterm`) on the server, and the interface will display locally via XMing.[](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty/windows)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **“Access Denied” Error**:
   - Verify username, password, or private key.
   - Ensure SSH access is enabled on the server (e.g., check hosting control panel settings).[](https://www.hostinger.com/uk/tutorials/how-to-use-putty-ssh)
   - Check if the server requires key-based authentication only.

2. **“Connection Reset by Peer”**:
   - Enable **Keepalives** in **Connection** settings to prevent timeouts.[](https://www.tecmint.com/putty-configuration-tips-and-tricks/)
   - Check firewall or network device settings that may close idle connections.

3. **“Server’s Host Key Not Cached”**:
   - This is normal for first-time connections. Click **Yes** to cache the key. If it appears repeatedly, verify the server’s authenticity to rule out a man-in-the-middle attack.[](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty/windows)

4. **Failed Login Attempts Warning**:
   - Reset your password or check for brute-force protection on the server.
   - Contact your server admin if locked out.[](https://www.hostinger.com/uk/tutorials/how-to-use-putty-ssh)

5. **PuTTY Window Closes Unexpectedly**:
   - Check server logs for errors (e.g., incorrect permissions on `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`).
   - Ensure the correct private key is loaded.[](https://www.hostinger.com/uk/tutorials/how-to-use-putty-ssh)
