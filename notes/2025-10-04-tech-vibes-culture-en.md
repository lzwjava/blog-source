Your observation about sharing habits in tech communities is spot on in many ways—social media dynamics do vary wildly by region, and that can feel like a proxy for broader "vibe" or excitement. But I'd push back a bit on the conclusion that Singaporeans or Europeans flat-out lack the tech energy of the US or China. It's more about cultural wiring, platforms, and priorities than an absence of buzz. Let me break it down.

### Sharing Habits: Why They Differ
- **Singapore/Hong Kong**: You're right—LinkedIn activity from tech folks here often skews professional and restrained, more like polished resumes than raw idea-dumps. This ties into a cultural emphasis on humility, hierarchy, and risk-aversion. Singapore's tech scene is booming (think Grab, Sea Group, or the government's Smart Nation push), but sharing happens in closed loops: private Slack channels, internal company forums, or events like Tech in Asia conferences. Public blasts on Twitter/X or LinkedIn? Less common, partly because of tight-knit networks and a "don't rock the boat" ethos. Post-COVID, there's been a uptick in X activity around events like TOKEN2049, where people rave about the "building and vibing" energy, but it's still not the firehose you see elsewhere.
  
- **China**: Pre-COVID Weibo/WeChat dominance makes total sense—those platforms are hyper-local, integrated into daily life (payments, groups, everything), so engineers could drop code snippets or paper breakdowns in massive communities. Post-COVID shift to X/Twitter aligns with global trends and VPN access, but it's edgier now, with more uncensored debates. The sheer scale (1.1B social users) amplifies everything, creating that explosive spread you mentioned.

- **USA**: Twitter/X is the town square for tech—engineers live-tweet papers, roast products, and crowdsource ideas in real-time. It's chaotic, ego-driven, and perfect for virality, fueling the "move fast and break things" hype.

- **Europe**: Similar to Singapore, sharing feels muted on public platforms. Europeans lean toward private messaging (WhatsApp groups) or niche forums over broadcast-style posts, thanks to GDPR privacy rules, cultural norms around work-life boundaries, and a focus on "fostering relationships" vs. self-promotion. But don't sleep on the hubs: Berlin's startup scene pulses with Telegram channels and Meetups; London's got fintech Twitter threads; Paris has its AI whispers on LinkedIn. It's just more fragmented across 50+ countries, without the unified platforms US/China have.

### Does This Mean Less "Tech Vibe"?
Not really—excitement shows up differently. Singapore's got that raw, optimistic build-mode energy (one visitor called it "SF/NYC without the nihilism"), with innovations like drone deliveries or digital IDs that lap places like the UK. Europe's got GDPR-fueled ethics in AI and massive funding (e.g., €7B for quantum tech), but it's collaborative and regulated, not the Wild West of Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. The US/China edge comes from scale, risk tolerance, and platforms built for spectacle—spreading ideas fast, sure, but also noise and burnout.

If anything, the "vibe gap" is about speed and showmanship. Singapore/Europe prioritize sustainable, behind-the-scenes grinding, which spreads knowledge more steadily (via papers, collabs) than viral tweets. Both regions are catching the wave—Singapore's pouring billions into AI, Europe's eyeing its own social platforms to counter Big Tech dominance. The excitement's there; it's just not always screaming on your feed.
