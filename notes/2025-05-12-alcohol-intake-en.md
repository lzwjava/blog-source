Will drinking a 330ml beer with 5% alcohol content lead to a DUI in China? I weigh 95 kg.

In China, the DUI threshold is a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.02% (20mg/100ml). Here’s an estimation:

### Given:
- Beer: 330ml, 5% alcohol
- Weight: 95 kg
- Gender not specified, assuming male (affects calculation)
- China DUI limit: BAC ≥ 0.02%

### Step 1: Calculate alcohol intake
- Alcohol in 330ml beer:
  \\[
  330 \times 0.05 = 16.5 \, \text{ml (pure alcohol)}
  \\]
- Alcohol weight (density ≈ 0.789 g/ml):
  \\[
  16.5 \times 0.789 = 13.01 \, \text{g}
  \\]

### Step 2: Estimate BAC
Using the **Widmark formula**:
\\[
BAC (\%) = \frac{\text{Alcohol (g)}}{\text{Weight (kg)} \times r} \times 100
\\]
Where \\( r \\) (distribution ratio) is ~0.68 for males:
\\[
BAC = \frac{13.01}{95 \times 0.68} \times 100 \approx 0.0201\%
\\]

### Step 3: Account for metabolism
Alcohol metabolizes at ~0.01%-0.015% per hour. If tested immediately, BAC ≈ 0.0201%, close to or slightly above 0.02%. After 1 hour:
\\[
BAC_{\text{1 hour}} \approx 0.0201\% - 0.01\% = 0.0101\%
\\]
This is below the DUI threshold.

### Conclusion:
- **Immediately after drinking** a 330ml, 5% beer, a 95 kg male’s BAC may be close to or slightly above 0.02%, risking a DUI.
- **Waiting 1+ hours** typically reduces BAC below 0.02%, making a DUI unlikely.
- **Advice**: Avoid driving for at least 1-2 hours after drinking, or don’t drive at all, as metabolism and testing accuracy vary.

**Note**: This is an estimate. BAC depends on gender, diet, metabolism, etc. Don’t rely solely on calculations—avoid driving after drinking.
