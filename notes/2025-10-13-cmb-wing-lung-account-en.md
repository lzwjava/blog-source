If you’re a Chinese citizen holding a Travel Permit (e.g. Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong & Macau Residents, etc.), you *can* open an individual bank account at **CMB Wing Lung Bank** in Hong Kong, though there are certain documents, steps, and restrictions. Below is a guide based on the bank’s published requirements and common practice. Always check the bank branch directly beforehand since policies may vary or change.

## What you’ll need (Documents & Information)

To open a **personal / individual account** (or joint) at CMB Wing Lung:

1. **Proof of identity**
   You need a government-issued photo ID. Options include:

   * Valid passport or travel document.
   * Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau. 
   * If you also hold a Mainland Resident Identity Card, that may be required in some cases. 

2. **Proof of residential address**
   Typically a utility bill, bank statement, government correspondence issued within the last 3 months, bearing your name and matching the address on your identity docs. 

3. **Other information / supporting documents**
   The bank may ask for additional information like:

   * Your occupation/employment/business details. 
   * Purpose of opening the account. 
   * Source of funds and/or wealth (i.e. where your initial deposit or incoming funds are from). 
   * Expected level of account activity (how often you’ll use it, what types of transactions). 

4. **Minimum deposit?**
   The bank may require a minimum deposit when opening the account. The exact amount depends on the branch/products. ([cmbwinglungbank.com][1])

## Steps to follow

1. **Visit a branch in person**
   You’ll need to go to a CMB Wing Lung Bank branch in Hong Kong to submit the documents and do face-to-face verification. ([cmbwinglungbank.com][2])

2. **Fill in application forms**
   You must complete the bank’s forms, sign specimen signature cards, etc. ([cmbwinglungbank.com][1])

3. **Verification / interview**
   The bank staff may ask you questions about your background, reasons for opening the account, expected transactions. They’ll verify your ID, address, etc. ([cmbwinglungbank.com][1])

4. **Deposit funds**
   Once everything is approved, you’ll deposit the initial amount as required. Then the account becomes active.

## Possible restrictions / things to watch out for

* **Non-Hong Kong residents** (which includes those without HKID) may face extra restrictions or requirements. Some services (e.g. cheques, RMB services) have limitations. ([cmbwinglungbank.com][1])
* **RMB (Renminbi) account** special rules apply if you are not a Hong Kong resident. For example, you may not be able to use RMB cheques in Mainland China; there may be caps on usage, etc. 
* Sometimes banks require proof of financial standing or history (e.g. average balances, source of income). Without that, your application might be delayed or rejected.
