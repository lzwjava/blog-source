title: Install Python 3.13 Dev Headers
translated: false
---

This new error reveals the final blocker in building `sentencepiece`: **missing Python development headers**.

---

### ❌ Error:

```
fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
```

This means the compiler cannot find `Python.h`, which is necessary for compiling Python C extensions.

---

### ✅ Solution

You need to install the Python 3.13 development headers:

#### For Ubuntu/Debian (Python 3.13):

Since Python 3.13 is very new, if you're using a custom build or `pyenv`, the headers may not be installed by default. Try one of the following:

1. **If you're using system-wide Python 3.13** (installed from deadsnakes or source):

```bash
sudo apt install python3.13-dev
```

2. **If you're using `pyenv`:**

```bash
pyenv install 3.13.0 --with-openssl --enable-shared
```

And ensure your virtual environment is using this version.

---

### 🔁 Then Retry:

Once the headers are installed, try again:

```bash
pip install sentencepiece --use-pep517
```

---

Let me know if you're using a custom Python install (e.g., compiled manually, via `pyenv`, `conda`, etc.), and I can give more specific guidance.
