Yes, the Huanggang Shuttle Bus (皇巴, or Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang Shuttle Bus) is a relatively cheap transport option after clearing customs at the Huanggang Port in Hong Kong, especially for newly arrived travelers heading quickly to the city center or San Tin Public Transport Interchange. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Huanggang Shuttle Bus Prices and Usage
- **Single Journey Fare**: HK$10 (about RMB 9), payable by cash, Octopus card, credit card, or mobile payment.
- **Night Discount** (midnight 12:00 to 6:30 AM): Free to board initially, then just HK$7 after clearing immigration.
- **Frequency**: Every 10-15 minutes from 6:30 AM to midnight, and every 10-20 minutes from midnight to 6:30 AM. 24-hour operation, with a journey time of about 15 minutes, going directly to the Lok Ma Chau Control Point (Hong Kong side) and San Tin Public Transport Interchange.
- **How to Board After Clearance**: After exiting Huanggang Port (Shenzhen side), head straight to the bus station at the port. The bus will first arrive at Lok Ma Chau Control Point (Hong Kong side), where you'll need to disembark to complete Hong Kong immigration (about 5-10 minutes). Then, reboard at the opposite stop to continue to the final destination. Luggage can stay on the bus, but take your valuables with you.

### Why It's Relatively Cheap?
- Compared to other options (like taxis or cross-border direct buses), the shuttle bus is the most affordable public transport. A taxi from the port to the city center might cost HK$200-300, while cross-border buses (e.g., to Mong Kok or Wan Chai) are HK$45-50 one way.
- From San Tin Interchange, transfer to Hong Kong MTR or buses (e.g., to Tsim Sha Tsui or Mong Kok) for a total cost of HK$20-30 to reach core city areas.
- If heading to Hong Kong Airport, after clearing Huanggang, take the shuttle to Yuen Long (transfer to Route 79 minibus for HK$7), then E34B bus (HK$13.9), totaling about HK$20-30—much cheaper than direct business vans (HK$80+).

### Notes
- **Luggage**: Limited to 1 checked bag (≤10kg) and 1 carry-on per person; oversized items incur extra fees.
- **Peak Times**: Weekends or holidays see heavy crowds at the border—avoid rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM).
- **Latest Info**: Fares remain stable in 2025 with no changes noted. For real-time schedules, check the Hong Kong Transport Department website or the GoByBus App.

If your destination is a specific area in Hong Kong (like the airport or Mong Kok), I can suggest a more precise route!
