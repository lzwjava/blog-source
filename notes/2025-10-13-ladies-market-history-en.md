Here’s a summary of what I found on the history of the **Ladies’ Market (Tung Choi Street, 通菜街), Mong Kok** — approx when it started, how it evolved. If you want, I can dig deeper with archival maps or government documents.

---

### Origins of Tung Choi Street

* The name *Tung Choi Street* literally means “water spinach street.” It reflects the land’s earlier use: vegetable fields, especially water spinach, in what was then more rural outskirts of what became Mong Kok. ([hong-kong-travelblog.com][1])
* The street itself was opened around **1924** when the area was being developed, with roads replacing farmland. ([hong-kong-travelblog.com][1])

### When the Market Activity Started

* Street hawkers along Tung Choi Street began selling various goods, including women’s clothing and accessories, around the **1960s**. It was informal at first — people doing hawker business without formal licensing or structure. ([Fridayeveryday][2])
* By the early 1970s, especially due to economic fluctuations (like the oil crisis), more people turned to hawking as a means of livelihood. ([nextstophongkong.com][3])

### Formalization: the Hawker Zone & Ladies’ Market Name

* In **1975**, the government (British colonial authorities) designated Tung Choi Street (between Argyle Street and Shantung Street) as one of the first *authorized hawking zones* in Kowloon. This created formal legal recognition for the market stalls. ([Ladies' Market][4])
* Because many of the stalls were selling women’s clothing and related accessories, the market became popularly known as “Ladies’ Market” or “Ladies’ Street” (女人街). ([hong-kong-travelblog.com][1])

---

### Evolution After That

* After 1975, as the market became more established, its geographic span was extended southwards to Dundas Street. ([Ladies' Market][4])
* Over time, although still called “Ladies’ Market,” the variety of goods expanded — not just women’s wear, but souvenirs, accessories, household items, etc. ([hongkongextras.com][5])
* Also later on, pedestrianization was introduced in parts (closing to vehicles during certain hours) to facilitate foot traffic and market activity. ([hongkongextras.com][5])

### So: Was it built in the 1950s or 60s?

* The street was established earlier (1924), but the *market as a recognized street hawker zone* really came into being in the **1960s** and **formalized in 1975**.
* So, while there was market / hawker activity in the 60s, the structure (legal hawker zone, widely known “Ladies Market”) was not official until mid-1970s.

If you like, I can try to find primary sources (old maps, government ordinances) to pin down the first hawkers there more precisely. Do you want that?
