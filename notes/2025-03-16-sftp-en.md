title: Setting Up an SFTP Server on Ubuntu
translated: false
---

Setting up an SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) server on Ubuntu is a straightforward process that allows you to securely transfer files over a network using SSH encryption. Below is a complete, step-by-step guide to help you set it up.

---

### Step 1: Install OpenSSH Server
SFTP relies on the OpenSSH server, which you need to install on your Ubuntu system.

1. Open a terminal and update your package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Install the OpenSSH server:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install openssh-server
   ```

3. Check that the SSH service is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status ssh
   ```
   - If it’s not running, start it:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start ssh
     ```
   - Ensure it starts on boot:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable ssh
     ```

### Step 2: Create a Dedicated SFTP User
For better security, create a specific user for SFTP access.

1. Add a new user (e.g., `sftpuser`):
   ```bash
   sudo adduser sftpuser
   ```
   - Follow the prompts to set a password and fill in any optional details.

2. (Optional) Prevent this user from accessing a shell via SSH:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -s /bin/false sftpuser
   ```

---

### Step 3: Configure SSH for SFTP
You can either allow all users to use SFTP with their home directories or restrict specific users to certain folders.

#### Option 1: Allow SFTP for All Users
If you want all users to access their home directories via SFTP, no extra configuration is needed after installing OpenSSH. Skip to Step 5.

#### Option 2: Restrict a User to a Specific Directory
To lock a user (e.g., `sftpuser`) to a specific directory:

1. Edit the SSH configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:
   ```ini
   Match User sftpuser
       ChrootDirectory /home/sftpuser
       ForceCommand internal-sftp
       AllowTcpForwarding no
       X11Forwarding no
   ```
   - Save the file (`Ctrl+O`, then `Enter`) and exit (`Ctrl+X`).

3. This configuration:
   - Limits `sftpuser` to `/home/sftpuser`.
   - Forces SFTP usage only.
   - Disables extra features like TCP forwarding.

---

### Step 4: Set Up Directory Permissions
For the restricted setup (chroot) to work, adjust permissions:

1. Make the chroot directory owned by root:
   ```bash
   sudo chown root:root /home/sftpuser
   ```

2. Create a writable subdirectory for the user (e.g., `uploads`):
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /home/sftpuser/uploads
   sudo chown sftpuser:sftpuser /home/sftpuser/uploads
   ```
   - The user can now upload files to `/home/sftpuser/uploads`.

---

### Step 5: Restart the SSH Service
Apply your changes by restarting SSH:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

---

### Step 6: Test Your SFTP Server
Verify that the server works by connecting from another device.

1. Find your Ubuntu machine’s IP address:
   ```bash
   ip addr show
   ```
   - Look for an IP like `192.168.1.100`.

2. Test the connection:
   - **From a terminal (Linux/macOS):**
     ```bash
     sftp sftpuser@<ubuntu-ip-address>
     ```
     - Enter the password when prompted.
   - **Using FileZilla (any OS):**
     - Host: `sftp://<ubuntu-ip-address>`
     - Username: `sftpuser`
     - Password: (your password)
     - Port: 22

3. Try uploading a file to the `uploads` folder or listing directory contents.

---

### Step 7: Configure the Firewall
If you’re using Ubuntu’s firewall (UFW), allow SFTP traffic:

1. Check the firewall status:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```

2. Allow SSH/SFTP (port 22):
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
   sudo ufw reload
   ```

---

### All Done!
Your SFTP server is now ready! Users can securely connect and transfer files to their designated directories using an SFTP client. If you restricted `sftpuser`, they’ll only access `/home/sftpuser/uploads` (or wherever you set). Enjoy secure file transfers!
