### Notes
- Selection prioritizes engineers and scientists under 30 (or successful by 30) with tangible tech contributions, based on sources like Forbes’ 30 Under 30 (2014–2024) and X posts.[](https://news.mit.edu/2016/forbes-30-under-30-lists-0107)[](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhedgecock/2015/01/05/30-under-30-young-scientists-who-are-changing-the-world/)[](https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/list-of-top-people-under-age-of-30-1704694608-1)
- Ages are estimated where exact birth years are unavailable, using achievement timelines (e.g., Forbes listings).
- Unlike the previous response, this list excludes pure entrepreneurs (e.g., Melanie Perkins, Ritesh Agarwal) and focuses on technical contributors in engineering and science.
- I critically examined sources to ensure relevance and accuracy, avoiding unverified claims from X posts unless corroborated (e.g., Quazi’s SpaceX role is widely reported).
- If you’d like a deeper dive into their projects, technical details (e.g., Quazi’s beam planning algorithms), or a chart comparing their fields or impacts, let me know! I can also search for additional candidates or analyze specific innovations.

Would you like me to generate a visual comparing their fields (e.g., aerospace vs. biomedical) or explore another angle (e.g., their patents, research papers)?
