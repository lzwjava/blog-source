The error shown is a `BeanDefinitionStoreException: Invalid bean definition` from the Spring Framework, indicating that there’s an issue with how a bean is defined in your Spring application context. This typically occurs during the initialization of the application context when Spring tries to load and parse bean definitions but encounters a problem, such as a misconfiguration, missing dependencies, or syntax errors in your configuration files.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and fix this issue, based on my knowledge of Spring Framework:

### 1. **Understand the Error**
   - The error occurs in `org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanDefinitionStoreException`, specifically stating "Invalid bean definition."
   - The stack trace shows the error originates in Spring’s `PlaceholderConfigurerSupport` or related classes, which are often used for property placeholder resolution (e.g., `@Value` annotations or `<context:property-placeholder>` in XML).
   - This suggests there might be an issue with a property file, a bean definition (e.g., in XML, Java `@Configuration`, or annotations), or a missing dependency.

### 2. **Check Your Configuration**
   - **Property Files**: If you’re using property placeholders (e.g., `${property.name}`), ensure:
     - The property file (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`) exists in the correct location (e.g., `src/main/resources`).
     - The property referenced in the bean definition exists in the file.
     - There are no typos or syntax errors in the property file.
   - **Bean Definitions**:
     - If using XML configuration, check for typos, missing or invalid bean definitions, or incorrect namespace declarations.
     - If using Java-based configuration (`@Configuration`), ensure `@Bean` methods are correctly defined, and there are no circular dependencies or missing dependencies.
     - If using annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, etc., ensure the packages are scanned correctly with `@ComponentScan`.
   - **Dependencies**: Verify that all required dependencies (e.g., in your `pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle) are present and compatible with your Spring version.

### 3. **Common Causes and Fixes**
   - **Missing or Misconfigured Property File**:
     - Ensure your `application.properties` or `application.yml` is correctly configured and loaded. For example, if using Spring Boot, ensure the file is in `src/main/resources`.
     - If using `<context:property-placeholder>` in XML, verify the `location` attribute points to the correct file (e.g., `classpath:application.properties`).
   - **Invalid Bean Definition**:
     - Check for typos in bean names, class names, or method names.
     - Ensure all classes referenced in bean definitions are available on the classpath and correctly annotated (e.g., `@Component`, `@Service`, etc.).
   - **Circular Dependencies**:
     - If two or more beans depend on each other, Spring might fail to initialize them. Use `@Lazy` on one of the dependencies or restructure your code to avoid circular references.
   - **Version Mismatch**:
     - Ensure your Spring Framework version and other dependencies (e.g., Spring Boot, Java version) are compatible. The stack trace shows Java 1.8.0_432, so ensure your Spring version supports this Java version.

### 4. **Inspect the Stack Trace**
   - Look at the classes mentioned in the stack trace, such as `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` or `ContextLoader`. These are part of Spring’s context initialization and property resolution.
   - The error might be caused by a missing or invalid property in a bean definition, so check any `@Value("${property}")` annotations or XML properties.

### 5. **Steps to Debug**
   - **Enable Debug Logging**: Add the following to your `application.properties` or log configuration:
     ```
     logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
     ```
     This will provide more detailed logs to help identify the exact bean or property causing the issue.
   - **Validate Configuration Files**: Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to validate your XML or Java configuration files for errors.
   - **Check Classpath**: Ensure all required classes, jars, and resources are on the classpath.

### 6. **Example Fixes**
   - **If Using `@Value` Annotations**:
     Ensure the property exists in `application.properties`:
     ```properties
     admin.email=admin@example.com
     ```
     And the bean is correctly defined:
     ```java
     @Value("${admin.email}")
     private String adminEmail;
     ```
   - **If Using XML**:
     Ensure your XML configuration is valid, e.g.:
     ```xml
     <context:property-placeholder location="classpath:application.properties"/>
     <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyClass">
         <property name="email" value="${admin.email}"/>
     </bean>
     ```
     Verify the property file and bean class exist.

### 7. **Test After Changes**
   - After making changes, restart your application and check if the error persists.
   - If the issue is still unresolved, look for more specific error messages in the logs or stack trace.

### 8. **If You Need More Help**
If you can provide more details—such as the specific bean definition, property file content, or Spring configuration—I can offer more targeted advice. Alternatively, I can search the web for additional resources or examples if you’d like me to assist further. Would you like me to search for more information or help with specific parts of your configuration?
