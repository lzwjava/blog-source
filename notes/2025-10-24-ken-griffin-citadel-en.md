### Ken Griffin: A Brief Introduction

Kenneth Cordele "Ken" Griffin is an American billionaire investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist, best known as the founder and CEO of Citadel, one of the world's most successful alternative investment firms.

Born on October 15, 1968, in Daytona Beach, Florida, Griffin grew up in a middle-class family and showed an early aptitude for finance. As a Harvard University sophomore in 1987, he began trading convertible bonds from his dorm room using a fax machine, personal computer, and $265,000 in seed capital from his grandmother. This entrepreneurial start laid the foundation for his future success.

In 1990, at age 22, Griffin launched Citadel from his Harvard apartment with $4.6 million in initial funding. What began as a small hedge fund has evolved into a global powerhouse, managing over $68 billion in assets as of recent reports. Citadel employs advanced quantitative trading strategies, algorithms, and technology to navigate complex markets, consistently ranking among the top-performing funds. In 2002, he also established Citadel Securities, a market-making firm that handles a significant portion of U.S. equity trading volume.

Today, Griffin is one of the wealthiest individuals globally, with a net worth estimated in the tens of billions. He relocated Citadel's headquarters from Chicago to Miami in 2022, citing a desire for a more business-friendly environment. Beyond finance, Griffin is a major donor to Republican causes, education, and medical research, including a $300 million gift to Harvard for financial aid and cancer studies. Known for his low-profile yet influential style, he remains a key figure in Wall Street's evolution through innovation and risk management.
