title: Determining Image Time From Conflicting Timestamps
translated: false

You're asking how to figure out "what time" an image (e.g., a screenshot that a teammate uploaded to Confluence) really represents, given all the timestamps and potential differences in timezones. Let me break down the situation:

---

### Sources of timestamps in your scenario:
1. **Image metadata (EXIF / file metadata)**  
   - If it’s an image file (like .jpg, .png, etc.), it may include metadata written by the OS or application at the time it was saved.  
   - Screenshots on Windows typically don’t carry rich EXIF data (like from cameras), but the *file creation/modification times* on the filesystem do exist.

2. **Confluence upload timestamp**  
   - Confluence stores the time the file was uploaded to the page/system.  
   - This time is stored in the server’s timezone (or in UTC, depending on the configuration) and usually shown to the viewer based on their Confluence profile timezone.

3. **Timestamp *inside* the screenshot**  
   - If it’s a Windows screenshot, the captured image may display the Windows system clock in the taskbar — this reflects the **uploader’s local system timezone/time** at the moment of capture.

4. **System settings / Timezones**  
   - Each participant could be in different timezones, and both Windows and Confluence adjust what times are displayed based on locale and user profile settings.

### How to reconcile them
- **Step 1: Look at the visible clock inside the Windows screenshot.**  
  That shows the uploader’s system-local time when the screenshot was taken.

- **Step 2: Look at the Confluence upload timestamp.**  
  Confluence shows when the image hit the server.  
  - If your Confluence is set to show times in *your* timezone, you may need to compare with the uploader’s timezone.  

- **Step 3: Consider file properties (if available).**  
  If you have the file (outside Confluence export), right-click → *Properties* → *Details* in Windows, which can give *file created/modified* timestamps. But keep in mind once it’s uploaded and downloaded, these may reset.  

- **Step 4: Adjust for timezone differences.**  
  - Convert everything to UTC or a common timezone for comparison.  
  - Example: If Confluence shows "2:00 PM UTC" upload time, and the screenshot shows "10:00 AM" on the taskbar, then likely the uploader system was running on a timezone 4 hours behind UTC.

---

### Practical answer
- You cannot 100% "prove" *when* the screenshot was taken just from inside Confluence since upload could be delayed.  
- What you **can** infer is:
  - The uploader’s **local system clock/timezone** from the time in the screenshot.  
  - The **latest possible moment** they uploaded from Confluence’s timestamp.  
- If times differ, it’s due to timezone offsets or a system clock that’s misconfigured.

---

✅ **So, to know if it’s a Windows screenshot:**  
- Look for UI: taskbar clock, Windows window elements, fonts, standard titlebars, etc.  
- If you see the taskbar clock, that time is in the system’s local timezone.  
- Compare against Confluence’s upload timestamp and convert both to UTC to line them up.

Would you like me to give you a **step-by-step workflow (like exact checks to do in Confluence and on Windows)** so you can verify whether the screenshot time matches the reported upload time?
