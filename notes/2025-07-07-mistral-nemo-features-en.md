translated: false
type: note
---

**Mistral NeMo** is a powerful 12-billion-parameter large language model (LLM) developed by **Mistral AI in collaboration with NVIDIA**. It's designed to deliver state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities, particularly excelling in reasoning, world knowledge, and coding accuracy within its size category.

Here are some key features and aspects of Mistral NeMo:

* **12 Billion Parameters:** This makes it a relatively compact yet highly capable model, balancing performance and efficiency.
* **Large Context Window:** It boasts a context window of up to 128k tokens, allowing it to process and understand much longer texts, complex documents, and multi-turn conversations more effectively.
* **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Mistral NeMo sets a new standard for models in its size class, demonstrating strong performance in tasks related to reasoning, general world knowledge, and code generation.
* **Multilingual Support:** Designed for global applications, it's proficient in many languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Hindi.
* **Tekken Tokenizer:** It uses a new tokenizer called Tekken (based on Tiktoken), which is more efficient at compressing natural language text and source code across over 100 languages compared to previous tokenizers.
* **Function Calling:** The model is trained on function calling, enhancing its ability to interact with and execute specific programmatic functions based on natural language inputs.
* **Quantization Awareness:** Trained with quantization awareness, it enables FP8 inference without compromising performance, which is crucial for efficient deployment.
* **Open-Source License:** Mistral NeMo is released under the Apache 2.0 license, promoting widespread adoption, customization, and integration by researchers and enterprises.
* **Easy Integration:** Its standard architecture makes it easy to use as a drop-in replacement for systems already utilizing Mistral 7B.
* **Collaboration with NVIDIA:** The model was trained on NVIDIA DGX Cloud AI platform and utilizes NVIDIA's optimized hardware and software ecosystem, including TensorRT-LLM for accelerated inference performance and the NeMo development platform for building custom generative AI models. It's also available as an NVIDIA NIM inference microservice.

In essence, Mistral NeMo aims to provide a versatile, high-performing, and efficient LLM that can run on a single GPU, making advanced AI capabilities more accessible for a wide range of enterprise applications like chatbots, summarization, language translation, and code generation.
