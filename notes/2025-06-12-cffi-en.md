When running your Python script `fetch.py` with the command `python scripts/supabase/fetch.py`, you encountered the following error:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_cffi_backend'
```

This error, along with the subsequent Rust panic and traceback, indicates that the Python interpreter cannot find the `_cffi_backend` module, which is a critical component of the `cffi` library. The `cffi` library is a dependency of the `cryptography` package, which is itself used by the `supabase` client in your script. Below, I’ll explain the issue and provide a step-by-step solution to resolve it.

### What’s Causing the Error?

The `_cffi_backend` module is part of the `cffi` library, which enables Python to interface with C code. The `cryptography` library, a dependency of both `jwt` and `supabase`, relies on `cffi` to perform cryptographic operations. The traceback shows that the error originates when `cryptography` attempts to import Rust bindings:

```
File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/cryptography/hazmat/_oid.py", line 9, in <module>
    from cryptography.hazmat.bindings._rust import (
        ObjectIdentifier as ObjectIdentifier,
    )
pyo3_runtime.PanicException: Python API call failed
```

The `ModuleNotFoundError` for `_cffi_backend` suggests that either `cffi` is not installed, not properly built, or incompatible with your Python environment. This triggers a failure in the Rust bindings, causing the panic and halting execution.

### How to Fix the Issue

Follow these steps to resolve the error and get your Supabase script running:

#### 1. **Check and Install the `cffi` Library**
The `cffi` library might be missing or incorrectly installed. Verify its presence and install it if necessary.

- **Check if `cffi` is installed:**
  ```bash
  pip show cffi
  ```
  This command will display information about the `cffi` package if it’s installed in your current Python environment.

- **Install or reinstall `cffi`:**
  If `cffi` is not installed or if there’s a chance it’s corrupted, run:
  ```bash
  pip install cffi
  ```
  To ensure a clean installation, you can uninstall and reinstall it:
  ```bash
  pip uninstall cffi
  pip install cffi
  ```

#### 2. **Install System Dependencies**
The `cffi` library requires certain system-level dependencies to build its C backend (`_cffi_backend`). On Ubuntu (based on your prompt `lzwjava@lzwjava-XiaoXin-14-IAH8`), install the `libffi-dev` package:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
```

This package provides the development files for `libffi`, which `cffi` needs to compile its backend.

#### 3. **Verify Python Version and Environment**
Your traceback shows paths like `/home/lzwjava/.local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/` and `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/`, indicating you’re using Python 3.13 and possibly have multiple Python installations.

- **Ensure you’re targeting the correct Python:**
  Run your script with an explicit Python version to avoid conflicts:
  ```bash
  python3.13 scripts/supabase/fetch.py
  ```
  Use the same Python version for package installation:
  ```bash
  python3.13 -m pip install cffi
  ```

- **Consider using a virtual environment:**
  To avoid conflicts between system-wide and user-installed packages, set up a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python3.13 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install supabase
  ```
  Then run your script:
  ```bash
  python scripts/supabase/fetch.py
  ```

#### 4. **Reinstall Related Packages**
The `supabase` client depends on `cryptography` and `jwt`, both of which rely on `cffi`. Reinstalling these packages ensures they’re compatible with your environment:

```bash
pip uninstall cryptography jwt supabase
pip install cryptography jwt supabase
```

#### 5. **Check Python 3.13 Compatibility**
Python 3.13 is a newer version, and some packages (e.g., `cryptography`) may not yet be fully tested with it. If issues persist, consider switching to a more stable version like Python 3.11:

- Install Python 3.11 (on Ubuntu):
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3.11 python3.11-dev python3.11-venv
  ```
- Create a virtual environment with Python 3.11:
  ```bash
  python3.11 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install supabase
  ```
- Run your script again.

#### 6. **Debugging Persistent Issues**
If the error persists, gather more details:
- Run with a Rust backtrace for additional context:
  ```bash
  RUST_BACKTRACE=1 python scripts/supabase/fetch.py
  ```
- Check your `PYTHONPATH` for conflicts:
  ```bash
  echo $PYTHONPATH
  ```
  If it’s set, ensure it doesn’t interfere with package locations.

### Why This Should Work

The error stems from a missing or misconfigured `cffi` library, which disrupts the `cryptography` package’s ability to load its Rust bindings. By ensuring `cffi` is installed, system dependencies are met, and your Python environment is consistent, the `_cffi_backend` module should become available, allowing your script to run successfully.

---

### Final Steps
After applying these fixes, test your script again:
```bash
python scripts/supabase/fetch.py
```
