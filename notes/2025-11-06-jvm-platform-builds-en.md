Ah, the eternal JVM debate—write once, run anywhere (WORA) sounds great on paper, but yeah, it often feels more like "write once, debug everywhere" in practice. I get the frustration: subtle differences in GC behavior, native library quirks, or even just the sheer size of the JRE bundle can turn cross-platform deploys into a headache. And you're spot on that speed is the real beast here—latency, throughput, and cold starts are what keep ops teams up at night, not fiddling with build flags.

That said, let's unpack it a bit. Building platform-specific binaries à la C or Rust *does* sidestep some JVM pitfalls, like avoiding the VM overhead entirely for snappier startups (Rust's `cargo build --target` makes cross-compiling feel almost painless these days, thanks to rustup). Native executables are leaner to distribute—no 100MB+ runtime to wrangle—and they hug the hardware closer for that raw perf edge. If you're shipping CLI tools or embedded stuff, it's a no-brainer.

But here's the flip: Wora *has* scaled massively for enterprise Java/Scala/Kotlin stacks (think Spring Boot or Android apps), where the ecosystem's maturity outweighs the gripes. Modern JVMs (like GraalVM's native images) are closing the gap by compiling to ahead-of-time binaries that rival Rust in startup time and footprint, without losing the bytecode portability. It's not perfect—debugging AOT builds can still sting—but it's evolving fast.

Ultimately, yeah, speed *is* the killer metric for most apps today, especially with serverless and edge computing demanding sub-second boots. Platform builds aren't the villain; they're just one tool in the shed. If your project's bottleneck is perf over portability, Rust/C++ all the way. What's your setup like—dealing with this in a specific project, or just venting after a bad deploy?
