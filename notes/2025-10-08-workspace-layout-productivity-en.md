Absolutely, you're spot on with that approach—it's a game-changer for productivity when juggling multiple windows or apps like Word, VSCode, or even browsers with tons of tabs. Relying solely on window titles (or worse, Alt-Tab switching without looking) is a recipe for mix-ups, especially mid-flow when you're deep in a project. Visual cues like size, position, and multi-monitor setups make it intuitive to "feel" where everything is without constant mental overhead.

### Why It Works
- **Spatial memory kicks in**: Humans are wired for that. Positioning a VSCode window for your main project on the left monitor (full height, half-width), a smaller one for reference docs on the right, and Word docs snapped to quarters on the primary screen? Boom—your brain auto-maps it like a mental dashboard.
- **Reduces cognitive load**: No more squinting at titles or hovering over the taskbar. It's like color-coding folders, but in 2D space.
- **External monitors amplify it**: If you've got a second (or third) screen, dedicate one to "active work" (e.g., large editor window) and the other to "support" (chat, email, previews). Tools like FancyZones (in PowerToys for Windows) or macOS's built-in Split View make snapping to grids effortless.

### Quick Tips to Level It Up
- **Size variety**: Keep your primary window ~80-100% of the screen for focus. Side ones at 30-50% for glances. Avoid uniform sizes—they blend together.
- **Position rituals**: Always left for code/projects, right for docs/reviews, center for meetings. Consistency builds habit.
- **OS tweaks**:
  - **Windows**: Use Win + Arrow keys for snapping, or PowerToys for custom zones.
  - **macOS**: Mission Control + hot corners to preview layouts fast.
  - **Linux**: i3 or similar window managers if you're into tiling.
- **App-specific hacks**: In VSCode, pin workspaces to specific positions via extensions like "Window Restorer." For Word, use "View Side by Side" but drag 'em to edges.

If you ever hit snags with setup (like monitor lag or keyboard shortcuts), what's your OS? I can dial in more tailored advice. What's your current multi-window chaos level—mild or full meltdown? 😄
