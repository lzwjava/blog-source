**Is it safe to charge during heavy rain?**

Charging electric vehicles or electronic devices during heavy rain carries certain risks, so caution is advised. Here are some key points:

1. **Safety Hazards**:  
   - Rainwater may seep into charging ports, sockets, or devices, causing short circuits, leakage, or even electric shock.  
   - Outdoor charging stations with insufficient waterproof ratings (e.g., below IP65) may be unsafe in heavy rain.  
   - Indoor charging can also be risky if sockets or wiring are damp.

2. **Recommendations**:  
   - **Avoid outdoor charging**: Try not to charge electric vehicles or devices outdoors during heavy rain, especially without proper shelter.  
   - **Check waterproof ratings**: Ensure charging equipment and sockets have adequate waterproofing (e.g., IP67 or higher).  
   - **Charge indoors safely**: Move devices to a dry indoor environment for charging, ensuring sockets and wiring are dry.  
   - **Use protective devices**: Opt for sockets or chargers with leakage protection to reduce risks.  
   - **Dry devices thoroughly**: Before charging, ensure the device and charging port are completely dry to prevent water ingress.

3. **Emergency Situations**:  
   If charging during rain is unavoidable, use specially designed waterproof charging equipment and ensure rainproof measures (e.g., waterproof covers or tents). Check charging cables for damage to avoid leakage risks.

**Summary**: Avoid charging during heavy rain, especially outdoors. If charging is necessary, ensure a dry environment, waterproof equipment, and safety measures. When in doubt, prioritize safety and wait until the rain stops.
