### Edibility of Sprouted Potatoes After Prolonged Storage

Yes, sprouted potatoes (including varieties like those from Shandong and purple sweet potatoes) can often still be eaten after 20+ days at home, but with some important caveats. Here's a step-by-step explanation based on food safety principles:

1. **What happens when potatoes sprout?**  
   Potatoes are tubers that naturally sprout to reproduce when conditions are right (e.g., warmth, moisture, or prolonged storage). Sprouting starts when tiny "eyes" (buds) at the skin surface grow into shoots, sometimes called "teeth" in some languages. During this, the potato produces solanine, a mildly toxic compound that can cause nausea, vomiting, or stomach upset if consumed in large amounts—mainly concentrated in the sprouts, skin, and green spots.

2. **Are they safe after 20+ days?**  
   - **Generally safe if sprouting is minor:** If the potatoes have only small sprouts (under 1-2 inches) and the rest looks firm and unblemished (no wrinkles, softness, greenish tint, or rot), they're usually fine to eat. At this stage, solanine levels aren't dangerously high.  
   - **Not safe if extensively sprouted:** If they're wrinkly, mushy, heavily green, or have long sprouts roooting into the flesh, discard them. Decomposition bacteria can develop, risking foodborne illness.  
   - 20 days isn't exceptionally long for cool, dark storage, but sprouting suggests suboptimal conditions (e.g., too warm or humid). Freshness decreases over time, but most varieties hold up decently.

3. **How to prepare them safely:**  
   - Peel off the skin and cut away all sprouts, green spots, and any discolored areas, as these contain the highest toxin levels.  
   - Cook thoroughly (boil, bake, or fry) at high temperatures to deactivate any solanine. Avoid eating raw sprouts.  
   - For purple sweet potatoes (rich in antioxidants like anthocyanins), the same rules apply; their color doesn't change safety.  

4. **Evidence and risks:**  
   - Based on U.S. FDA and USDA guidelines, lightly sprouted potatoes are considered edible if properly trimmed and cooked, as solanine becomes harmful only in excess (e.g., from large amounts of green potato or sprouts). Studies from food science (e.g., via institutions like Cornell University) show solanine is bitter and acts as a natural defense, but it's not lethal in casual consumption.  
   - However, if you have immune issues, are pregnant, or notice mold/odor, err on caution—spoiled potatoes can harbor pathogens like Clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism.  
   - Shelf life: Potatoes stored at 45-55°F (7-13°C) in a dark, ventilated spot can last 2-3 months, but sprouting accelerates after 1-2 weeks if warmer.

If unsure, consult local food safety resources or discard. For best freshness, store them properly to prevent early sprouting! If this is about a specific variety or condition, more details could help refine the advice.
