### How to Book the Computer-Based Practical Exam for Self-Taught Higher Education Examination (STHEE) Course 610201 (Computer Application Technology) at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies (GDUFS)

The practical assessment (实践考核) for course 610201 Computer Application Technology (专科 level, now updated to code 510201) is a required computer-based exam (上机考试), typically course code **11325: Computer and Application Course Experiment (I)**. This is an on-machine test conducted in a computer lab. There is no individual "appointment" for a specific time slot like booking a doctor's visit—instead, you register during a fixed window, and the university assigns your lab seat and exam session (usually multiple sessions on the exam day). The exam is held on designated dates at GDUFS's Baiyun Campus (Guangzhou).

**Important Notes:**
- **Eligibility**: You must have passed at least **2 theory (pen-and-paper) courses** in the 610201 major before registering for this practical exam. Verify your passed courses in the Guangdong STHEE system.
- **Exam Format**: Combines written test (if applicable) and on-machine operation. Duration is typically 2-3 hours per session. Bring ID; no late entry after start time.
- **Fee**: 150 RMB per person (non-refundable; paid online during registration).
- **Current Status (as of October 26, 2025)**: The 2025 second-half exam is scheduled for **November 1-2, 2025**. Registration closed in June 2025. If you registered, query your assigned seat today (see Step 6 below). For the next opportunity (2026 first half), registration opens in December 2025—check the official site for exact dates.
- **No Third-Party Help**: GDUFS does not partner with external agencies for registration or prep classes. Use only official channels to avoid scams.
