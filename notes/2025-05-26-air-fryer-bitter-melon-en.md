Cooking **Momordica charantia** (bitter melon) in an air fryer at **180°C (356°F) for 16 minutes** likely resulted in overcooking and burning due to a combination of factors. Here's why and how to adjust:

1. **High Temperature for Too Long**: 
   - Bitter melon has a high water content and thin flesh, which cooks relatively quickly. At 180°C, 16 minutes is excessive, especially in an air fryer where hot air circulates intensely, accelerating cooking and potentially causing charring or burning on the surface.
   - The dark, burned spots indicate the exterior dried out and caramelized or charred before the interior was fully cooked.

2. **Uneven Cutting or Thickness**:
   - If the bitter melon pieces were unevenly cut, thinner pieces would cook faster and burn while thicker pieces might still be cooking. Uniform slicing (about 1/4-inch thick) helps ensure even cooking.

3. **Lack of Oil or Moisture**:
   - Bitter melon can dry out quickly in an air fryer due to its low natural oil content. Without a light coating of oil, the surface is prone to burning. Oil helps conduct heat evenly and prevents excessive drying.

4. **Air Fryer Basket Overcrowding**:
   - Overcrowding the basket can lead to uneven air circulation, causing some pieces to burn while others remain undercooked. The hot air needs space to circulate properly.

5. **No Flipping or Shaking**:
   - Air fryers cook food unevenly if not flipped or shaken during cooking. This can cause one side to burn while the other side remains undercooked.

### How to Fix It:
- **Lower the Temperature and Time**: Try cooking at **160°C (320°F) for 8-12 minutes**, depending on the size of the pieces. Check for doneness around 8 minutes.
- **Toss with Oil**: Lightly coat the bitter melon slices with 1-2 teaspoons of oil (e.g., vegetable or olive oil) to prevent drying and promote even browning.
- **Cut Evenly**: Slice the bitter melon uniformly, about 1/4-inch thick, to ensure consistent cooking.
- **Avoid Overcrowding**: Arrange the slices in a single layer with space between them for proper air circulation.
- **Shake or Flip**: Halfway through cooking, shake the basket or flip the pieces to ensure even exposure to heat.
- **Check for Doneness**: Bitter melon should be tender but still slightly crisp with a light golden color, not dark or charred.

### Optional Tips:
- **Parboil or Soak**: To reduce bitterness and soften the texture, you can parboil the bitter melon for 1-2 minutes or soak it in salted water for 10-15 minutes before air frying. Pat dry thoroughly before cooking.
- **Seasoning**: Add seasonings like salt, pepper, or spices before cooking to enhance flavor without burning (avoid sugary seasonings, as they can burn easily).

Next time, try starting with **160°C for 8-10 minutes**, tossing with a little oil, and shaking the basket halfway through. Adjust based on your air fryer’s wattage and the size of the bitter melon pieces. If you want a visual guide for cooking times or temperatures, let me know, and I can provide a chart!

Cooking **carrots** in an air fryer can work, but the poor taste and texture you experienced when cutting them into cubes and air frying are likely due to several factors. Here's why it might not have turned out well and how to improve the results:

### Why Carrots May Not Taste Good When Air Fried:
1. **High Heat Dries Out Carrots**:
   - Air fryers use intense, circulating hot air, which can dry out carrots, especially when cut into small cubes. Carrots have moderate water content but are dense, so cubes may lose moisture on the surface before the interior softens, resulting in a tough, dry, or mealy texture and lackluster flavor.

2. **Uneven Cooking**:
   - Carrot cubes, especially if not uniform in size, cook unevenly in an air fryer. Smaller pieces may become overly crispy or burnt, while larger pieces remain undercooked, leading to an inconsistent texture that affects taste.

3. **Lack of Oil or Seasoning**:
   - Without a light coating of oil, carrots can taste bland and fail to develop the caramelized, sweet flavor that comes from proper roasting. Oil helps enhance browning and brings out the natural sugars in carrots, which are muted when air fried without it.

4. **Overcooking or Undercooking**:
   - If cooked too long at a high temperature (like 180°C for 16 minutes, as you used for bitter melon), carrot cubes can burn or become overly crispy, losing their sweetness. If undercooked, they may taste raw and starchy, which is unappealing.

5. **Cube Shape**:
   - Cubes have a higher surface area-to-volume ratio compared to slices or sticks, which can cause them to dry out faster in an air fryer. This shape may not retain enough moisture during cooking, leading to a poor texture.

6. **Natural Flavor of Carrots**:
   - Carrots have a mild, sweet flavor that can taste bland if not properly seasoned or cooked to enhance their natural sugars. Air frying without proper preparation (e.g., oil, seasoning, or par-cooking) can fail to bring out their best qualities.

### Why Air Frying Carrots Can Be Tricky (But Not Inappropriate):
Air frying carrots isn’t inherently inappropriate—it’s a viable method—but it requires careful preparation to avoid the issues you encountered. Unlike deep-frying or roasting in an oven, air fryers cook faster and can dehydrate dense vegetables like carrots if not managed properly.

### How to Improve Air-Fried Carrots:
1. **Adjust Temperature and Time**:
   - Cook at **175°C (350°F) for 10-15 minutes**, depending on cube size (smaller cubes need less time). Check for doneness by piercing with a fork; they should be tender but not mushy.

2. **Cut Uniformly**:
   - Cut carrots into uniform cubes (about 1/2-inch) or try sticks or coins for better texture. Uniform pieces ensure even cooking.

3. **Toss with Oil**:
   - Lightly coat carrots with 1-2 teaspoons of oil (e.g., olive, avocado, or vegetable oil) per cup of carrots. Oil promotes caramelization, enhances flavor, and prevents drying.

4. **Season Well**:
   - Add seasonings like salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, or herbs (e.g., thyme, rosemary) to enhance flavor. For sweetness, a pinch of brown sugar or honey (sparingly) can amplify the carrots’ natural sugars without burning.

5. **Par-Cook for Better Texture**:
   - To avoid a dry or tough texture, parboil or steam carrot cubes for **3-5 minutes** before air frying. This softens them slightly, ensuring they cook evenly and retain moisture. Pat dry thoroughly before air frying.

6. **Avoid Overcrowding**:
   - Place carrots in a single layer with space between pieces for proper air circulation. Cook in batches if necessary to prevent steaming instead of roasting.

7. **Shake or Flip**:
   - Shake the basket or flip the carrots halfway through cooking to ensure even browning and prevent burning.

### Example Method for Tasty Air-Fried Carrots:
- **Prep**: Cut carrots into 1/2-inch cubes or sticks. Toss with 1-2 tsp olive oil, a pinch of salt, pepper, and optional spices (e.g., cumin or paprika).
- **Optional Parboil**: Boil cubes for 3-4 minutes, drain, and pat dry.
- **Air Fry**: Cook at 175°C (350°F) for 10-12 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through. Check for a tender, slightly caramelized texture.
- **Taste Check**: Carrots should be tender, slightly crisp on the outside, and sweet with enhanced flavor from seasonings.

### Why Bitter Melon and Carrots Differ:
Unlike **Momordica charantia** (bitter melon), which is softer and more watery, carrots are denser and require more careful attention to moisture and cooking time in an air fryer. Bitter melon burns easily due to its thin structure, while carrots dry out or remain undercooked if not prepped properly.

### Final Note:
Air frying carrots is appropriate with the right technique. Your poor results likely stem from the cube shape, lack of oil or seasoning, and possibly an overly high temperature or time. Try the above adjustments for better flavor and texture. If you’d like a visual comparison of cooking times or methods for carrots, I can generate a chart—just let me know!
