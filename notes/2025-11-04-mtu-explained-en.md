### What is MTU in Networking?

**MTU** stands for **Maximum Transmission Unit**. It refers to the largest size (in bytes) of a single data packet that can be transmitted over a network interface or protocol without needing to be fragmented into smaller pieces.

#### Key Details:
- **Typical Values**: 
  - Ethernet networks often use an MTU of 1500 bytes (the standard for most IP-based networks).
  - Jumbo frames can go up to 9000 bytes or more on supported hardware.
  - IPv6 has a minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.
- **Why It Matters**:
  - **Efficiency**: Larger MTUs reduce overhead (e.g., fewer headers per data unit), improving throughput.
  - **Fragmentation Issues**: If a packet exceeds the MTU of a link, it may be split (fragmented) or dropped, leading to delays, retransmissions, or errors (like "packet too big" ICMP messages).
  - **Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)**: Devices use this process to find the smallest MTU along a network path and adjust packet sizes accordingly to avoid fragmentation.
- **Common Problems**: Mismatched MTUs between devices (e.g., VPN tunnels) can cause connectivity issues. You can check or set MTU using tools like `ifconfig` (Linux/macOS) or `netsh` (Windows).

In short, MTU defines the "max payload" limit for packets, balancing speed and compatibility in network design.
