title: JetBrains Annotations for Code Quality
translated: false
---

The `<dependency>` you provided specifies the `org.jetbrains:annotations` library in a Maven project. Here's what it's about:

### Details:
- **Group ID**: `org.jetbrains` (indicates the library is provided by JetBrains, the creators of IntelliJ IDEA and other tools).
- **Artifact ID**: `annotations` (the specific library name).
- **Purpose**: The `org.jetbrains:annotations` library provides a set of Java annotations used to enhance code quality, readability, and IDE support. These annotations are primarily for static code analysis and do not have runtime dependencies or behavior.

### Key Annotations:
The library includes annotations like:
- **`@NotNull`**: Indicates that a method parameter, return value, or field cannot be `null`. IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA use this to warn about potential `null` usage during development.
  - Example: `public void process(@NotNull String input) { ... }`
- **`@Nullable`**: Indicates that a parameter, return value, or field can be `null`, helping developers avoid unchecked null assumptions.
  - Example: `@Nullable String getOptionalValue() { return null; }`
- **`@Contract`**: Specifies a contract for a method’s behavior (e.g., input-output relationships) to aid static analysis.
  - Example: `@Contract("null -> fail")` indicates a method throws an exception if given `null`.
- **`@Unmodifiable`**: Marks a collection as unmodifiable to indicate it should not be changed.
- Others: `@Range`, `@NonNls`, etc., for specific use cases like value constraints or localization.

### Common Use Cases:
- **Code Analysis**: Enhances IDE inspections (e.g., in IntelliJ IDEA) to catch potential bugs like null pointer exceptions at development time.
- **Code Documentation**: Makes code intent clearer (e.g., whether `null` is allowed).
- **Interoperability**: Works with tools like IntelliJ IDEA, FindBugs, or SpotBugs for better static analysis.
- **No Runtime Overhead**: The annotations are metadata-only and typically have no impact on the compiled code unless explicitly processed by a tool.

### Maven Dependency Example:
To include the library in your `pom.xml`, you typically specify a version (since your snippet omits it):
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jetbrains</groupId>
    <artifactId>annotations</artifactId>
    <version>24.1.0</version> <!-- Use the latest version, e.g., from Maven Central -->
    <scope>provided</scope> <!-- Optional, as annotations are typically not needed at runtime -->
</dependency>
```
- **Version**: Check [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains/annotations) for the latest version (e.g., `24.1.0` as of recent data).
- **Scope**: Often set to `provided` or `compile` since the annotations are used during development but not required at runtime.

### Why Use It?
- Improves code safety by catching potential issues early through IDE warnings.
- Enhances code clarity by explicitly documenting nullability and other constraints.
- Widely used in projects developed with JetBrains tools or requiring robust static analysis.

The `org.jetbrains:annotations` library is **not outdated** and remains actively maintained by JetBrains. It is compatible with higher JDK versions and widely used for code inspection, documentation, and enhancing static analysis in Java and Kotlin projects, particularly with IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains tools.

### Key Points on Relevance and Compatibility:
- **Active Maintenance**: The library is regularly updated. As of recent data, the latest version is `26.0.2` (GitHub - JetBrains/java-annotations). JetBrains continues to release updates to support modern Java development practices.[](https://github.com/JetBrains/java-annotations)
- **JDK Compatibility**: 
  - The `annotations` artifact requires **JDK 1.8 or higher**. For projects using older JDK versions (1.5, 1.6, or 1.7), JetBrains provides a legacy `annotations-java5` artifact, which is no longer updated.[](https://github.com/JetBrains/java-annotations)
  - It is fully compatible with higher JDK versions, including **JDK 17, 21, and beyond**, as these are supported by IntelliJ IDEA for development. The library works seamlessly with modern Java features like lambdas, streams, and modules introduced in JDK 8 and later.[](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/supported-java-versions.html)
- **Purpose and Usage**: The annotations (e.g., `@NotNull`, `@Nullable`, `@Contract`) enhance static analysis in IDEs, catching potential errors like null pointer exceptions at design time. They are metadata-only, meaning they have no runtime dependency and are compatible across JDK versions without affecting runtime behavior.[](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/annotating-source-code.html)
- **Integration with IntelliJ IDEA**: IntelliJ IDEA recognizes these annotations natively and can infer them even if not explicitly added, ensuring compatibility with modern Java projects. The IDE also supports configuring custom annotations and can insert nullability annotations automatically.[](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/annotating-source-code.html)
- **No Deprecation**: Unlike some Java features (e.g., applets or legacy Java EE modules), there is no indication that JetBrains annotations are deprecated or obsolete. They are integral to JetBrains' ecosystem, including ReSharper and Rider for .NET development.[](https://medium.com/%40Brilworks/whats-changed-in-java-versions-new-features-and-deprecation-bbad0414bfe6)[](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JetBrains.Annotations/)

### Specifics for Higher JDKs:
- **JDK 8+ Features**: The annotations work with modern Java features (e.g., lambdas, type annotations, streams) introduced in JDK 8 and later, as these are supported by IntelliJ IDEA.[](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/supported-java-versions.html)
- **Annotation Processing**: IntelliJ IDEA’s annotation processing supports `org.jetbrains:annotations` in projects using higher JDKs, ensuring compatibility with compile-time code generation and validation.[](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/annotation-processors-support.html)
- **No Runtime Impact**: Since the annotations are erased from metadata by default (unless the `JETBRAINS_ANNOTATIONS` compilation symbol is defined), they do not introduce compatibility issues with any JDK version.[](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JetBrains.Annotations/)

### Why It’s Not Outdated:
- **Continued Relevance**: The annotations enhance code safety and maintainability, especially for nullability checks, which remain critical in modern Java development. They complement frameworks like Spring and Lombok, which also use annotations for similar purposes.[](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/annotating-source-code.html)
- **Ecosystem Support**: JetBrains’ tools (IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, etc.) rely on these annotations for advanced code analysis, and the JetBrains Runtime (a fork of OpenJDK) supports running modern Java applications.[](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime)[](https://developer.android.com/build/jdks)
- **Community Usage**: The library is widely adopted in Java and Kotlin projects, as seen in its inclusion in popular GitHub repositories and NuGet packages for .NET.[](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JetBrains.Annotations/)

### Recommendations:
- **Use Latest Version**: Include the latest version of `org.jetbrains:annotations` (e.g., `26.0.2`) in your `pom.xml` or Gradle build file to ensure compatibility with the latest IntelliJ IDEA features and JDK versions:
  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jetbrains</groupId>
      <artifactId>annotations</artifactId>
      <version>26.0.2</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
  ```
- **Check Project JDK**: Ensure your project is configured to use **JDK 8 or higher** to avoid needing the legacy `annotations-java5` artifact. IntelliJ IDEA’s project settings allow you to specify the JDK version (File | Project Structure | SDKs).[](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html)
- **Enable Annotation Processing**: In IntelliJ IDEA, enable annotation processing (Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Compiler | Annotation Processors) to fully leverage the library’s capabilities.[](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/annotation-processors-support.html)
- **Higher JDKs**: If using JDK 17 or 21 (common in modern projects), the annotations are fully compatible. For example, Android Studio’s JetBrains Runtime (based on OpenJDK) supports these annotations for Android development with JDK 17+.[](https://developer.android.com/build/jdks)

### Conclusion:
The `org.jetbrains:annotations` library is not outdated and is fully compatible with higher JDK versions (8 and above, including 17, 21, and beyond). It remains a valuable tool for improving code quality and IDE integration, especially in JetBrains’ ecosystem. If you’re using a modern JDK and IntelliJ IDEA, you can confidently include this dependency without worrying about obsolescence.
