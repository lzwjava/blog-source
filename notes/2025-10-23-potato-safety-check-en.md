Potatoes stored in a refrigerator at 6°C for two months can generally still be safe to eat, provided they show no signs of spoilage. Here’s a breakdown of your query regarding "Tudou" (potatoes) from Shandong, stored in Guangzhou, China, and cooked in an air fryer:

### Are the Potatoes Still Edible?
1. **Storage Conditions**: 
   - Potatoes stored at 6°C (typical fridge temperature) can last for 1–3 months, depending on their condition at purchase. The cool temperature slows sprouting and spoilage, but prolonged refrigeration can increase sugar content, potentially affecting taste and cooking properties.
   - Check for spoilage signs:
     - **Smell**: A bad odor (musty, rotten, or moldy) indicates spoilage.
     - **Appearance**: Look for green spots (indicating solanine, a toxin), excessive sprouting, soft or shriveled texture, or mold. Small sprouts can be cut away, but green or heavily sprouted potatoes should be discarded.
     - **Texture**: If the potatoes are still firm and not mushy, they are likely fine.

2. **Safety**: If the potatoes look and smell normal (firm, no green patches, no foul odor), they should be safe to eat after two months at 6°C. Discard any that show signs of spoilage.

### Cooking with an Air Fryer
Slicing and cooking potatoes in an air fryer for 15 minutes is a great way to prepare them. Here’s a quick guide for your air fryer potato slices:

1. **Preparation**:
   - **Wash and Inspect**: Thoroughly wash the potatoes. Cut away any green spots or sprouts.
   - **Slicing**: Slice the potatoes thinly (about 3–5 mm thick) for crispy results. Uniform slices ensure even cooking.
   - **Seasoning**: Toss the slices with a small amount of oil (e.g., 1–2 tsp for 1–2 potatoes), salt, and optional spices (e.g., pepper, paprika, or garlic powder).

2. **Air Fryer Cooking**:
   - **Temperature**: Set the air fryer to 190–200°C (375–400°F) for crispy slices.
   - **Time**: 15 minutes is reasonable, but check and shake the basket halfway through to ensure even cooking. Thicker slices may need 18–20 minutes.
   - **Tips**: Avoid overcrowding the air fryer basket to ensure crispiness. Cook in batches if needed.

3. **Safety Note**: If the potatoes taste unusually sweet or bitter (due to solanine from green spots), discard them.

### Local Context (Guangzhou, China)
- Shandong potatoes are common in China and known for good quality. There’s no specific issue with Shandong potatoes stored in Guangzhou, as long as they were fresh when purchased and stored properly.
- Guangzhou’s humid climate doesn’t affect fridge-stored potatoes, but ensure the fridge is functioning well to maintain consistent temperature.

### Final Recommendation
If the potatoes are firm, free of green spots, sprouts, or bad odors, they are likely safe to eat. Slice them, season, and air fry at 190–200°C for 15–20 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through. Enjoy your crispy potato slices! If you notice any spoilage signs, discard the affected potatoes to avoid health risks.
