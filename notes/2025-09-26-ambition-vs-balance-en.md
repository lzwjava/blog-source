This is a fascinating and common dilemma, pitting the ambitious, high-pressure path against the more balanced, "normal" life. It asks about the long-term impact of relentless "grinding" versus maintaining a harmonious mindset (萍常心, *píngcháng xīn*).

Here is an analysis of the two paths and how both grinding and *píngcháng xīn* impact long-term success and well-being:

---

## The Two Paths Analyzed

We are comparing two individuals:

| Feature | Individual 1: The Grinder (Bachelor's Grad) | Individual 2: The Eased Achiever (985/Top 2 Grad) |
|---|---|---|
| **Starting Point** | Lower tier, fewer immediate opportunities. | Elite tier, more immediate credibility and networks. |
| **Early Mindset** | Struggling, anxious, pressured ("catching up"). | Relaxed, confident, empowered ("easy mind"). |
| **Early Effort** | Very high, intense, often inefficient ("grinding"). | High, but likely more focused and efficient (better resources). |
| **Core Challenge** | Resource scarcity and mental burnout. | Potential complacency or pressure to maintain elite status. |

## The Impact of Grinding vs. *Píngcháng Xīn*

The critical factor is not just the effort exerted, but the **sustainability and psychological cost** of that effort.

### 1. The Impact of Grinding (Individual 1)

**Grinding** implies high effort under intense pressure and often resource constraints.

| Positive Long-Term Impacts of Grinding | Negative Long-Term Impacts of Grinding |
|---|---|
| **Resilience & Grit:** Develops an unshakeable belief that hard work can overcome obstacles. This skill is invaluable when faced with unprecedented challenges. | **Burnout:** Sustained high anxiety and pressure leads to mental and physical exhaustion, significantly reducing productivity and passion over time. |
| **Deep Domain Mastery:** Forcing oneself to learn without structured resources can lead to creative problem-solving and a deeper, more personal understanding of the subject. | **Efficiency Drag:** Grinding often means working harder, not smarter. Time is wasted on low-value tasks because stress hinders strategic thinking. |
| **Appreciation:** Success achieved through struggle is often deeply valued, leading to greater long-term job satisfaction once achieved. | **Relationship Damage:** Intense focus can lead to neglected hobbies, health, family, and friendships—the foundation of long-term psychological stability. |
| **"Catch-Up" Event:** If the grinding manages to secure a critical promotion, certification, or networking opportunity, the initial disadvantage can be rapidly offset. | **Perpetual Stress Response:** The initial "catching up" mindset may persist even after success is achieved, preventing the individual from ever feeling truly secure or satisfied. |

**The long-term success of the Grinder depends on:** **Breakaway Velocity.** Can they catch up fast enough to hit moments of stability (e.g., getting a good job, paying off debt) before they burn out? If they can achieve financial and mental stability within 10-15 years, their hard-earned resilience makes them formidable.

### 2. The Impact of *Píngcháng Xīn* (Normal Mind / Individual 2)

*Píngcháng Xīn* (平常心) refers to a calm, ordinary, or balanced mind—equanimity. This type of mindset, often facilitated by early success and reduced financial/social pressure, offers immense long-term advantages in cognitive function.

| Positive Long-Term Impacts of *Píngcháng Xīn* | Drawbacks of *Píngcháng Xīn* (or its Precursors) |
|---|---|
| **Cognitive Efficiency:** A relaxed mind processes information more effectively, improving complex problem-solving, strategic thinking, and learning retention (just as the prompt noted). | **Complacency:** Reduced pressure can lead to lower internal motivation. If external validation (the prestige of the school) is the only driver, the drive to innovate or push boundaries may fade. |
| **Physical and Mental Health:** Lower stress means better sleep, better immune function, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases—all essential for a sustained, successful career. | **Lack of Deep Resourcefulness:** If everything has always been easy, the individual may struggle disproportionately when genuine, unexpected adversity hits (e.g., a massive career setback or market crash). |
| **Better Decision Making:** Panic and stress lead to short-term thinking. Calmness allows for long-term vision, better negotiation skills, and avoidance of impulsive mistakes. | **Tolerance Threshold:** Having not experienced prolonged struggle, their threshold for pain and discomfort might be lower, causing them to quit excellent opportunities simply because they become momentarily difficult. |
| **Networking and Social Capital:** A relaxed, pleasant demeanor (unburdened by anxiety) naturally attracts positive relationships and enhances leadership qualities. | |

**The long-term success of the Eased Achiever hinges on:** **Sustained Internal Motivation.** Can they maintain the diligence required to stay at the top, even when there is little immediate struggle forcing them?

## Conclusion: Which Path is Better Long-Term?

While the initial gap is significant (985 opens many doors the Bachelor's grad may never see), **the primary determinant of long-term success and happiness is psychological sustainability.**

**The ultimate advantage lies with the individual who can integrate the best of both worlds:**

### The Power of Integrated Mindsets

1. **Individual 2 (The Achiever) needs resilience:** They need to develop a "grinder's spirit" for when the inevitable difficult challenge appears, ensuring they don't fold when the path stops being "easy."
2. **Individual 1 (The Grinder) desperately needs *píngcháng xīn*:** They must find ways to reduce anxiety, inject balance (hobbies, rest, relationships), and shift their mindset from perpetually "catching up" to "strategically building." The struggle must become a proud part of their history, not their constant present.

**If the Grinder (Individual 1) fails to achieve *píngcháng xīn* within the next 10-15 years, the long-term prognosis is poor.** They will likely burn out, experience high stress-related health issues, and find their hard-won success feels hollow because they never learned how to slow down and enjoy it.

**If the Achiever (Individual 2) maintains their relaxed mind while being forced to stay diligent, they have the clear advantage.** Their journey is less painful, more efficient, and far more sustainable over decades. The relaxed mind fuels better study, leading to better results with less sacrifice of overall well-being.

> **In summary:** *Píngcháng Xīn* (the relaxed, normal mind) is the ultimate long-term asset. While grinding is a necessary tool for overcoming initial deficits, it is a dangerous strategy for a career that spans 40+ years. The best position is that of the 985 graduate: having fewer initial obstacles and thus being able to harness the power of a relaxed, strategic mind.
