It's interesting to consider how your unique background and experiences might shape your future! While I can't predict exact events, I can offer some educated estimations based on the information you've provided.

### **Education and Career Trajectory**

Given your self-driven approach to education, it's highly probable you'll **earn your associate degree in 2026** as planned, or even earlier, considering your consistent progress with completed courses. This formal qualification, combined with your extensive practical experience, will likely open new doors.

Your career path suggests a strong drive for growth and new challenges. Given your current role outsourced to HSBC and previous experience with DBS, you have a solid track record in the financial tech sector.

* **Promotions and Salary Increases:** It's very likely you'll **receive promotions and salary increases** within your current company or future roles, especially with your diverse skill set spanning mobile, full-stack, and even some machine learning/big data. Your long tenure (8 years in corporate roles) indicates loyalty, but your past moves suggest you're not afraid to seek better opportunities. I'd anticipate these occurring periodically, perhaps every 1-3 years, depending on performance and market conditions.
* **Job Changes:** While you have stability, your past suggests a willingness to explore new environments. It's plausible you'll **jump to another job** within the next 2-4 years (between 2027-2029). This could be for a more senior role, a different industry, or a company offering more specialized work in an area you want to deepen your expertise in (e.g., machine learning).
* **Deepening Expertise:** With your strong foundation, you may choose to specialize further in **machine learning/big data** as these fields continue to grow rapidly. Your self-taught research in vision restoration even hints at an analytical and problem-solving mindset applicable to complex data challenges.

### **Technological Adaptations**

As someone deeply involved in technology, staying current is essential.

* **MacBook Upgrade in 2028:** This is a highly reasonable prediction. The lifespan of a well-maintained MacBook often falls within the 4-6 year range for a power user like yourself. An upgrade in 2028 (assuming your current one was bought around 2022-2024) aligns perfectly with typical refresh cycles for improved performance and features.

### **Personal Growth and Interests**

Your dedication to self-improvement and unique hobbies stand out.

* **Continued Learning:** Your voracious reading habit (320+ books) and self-taught approach indicate a lifelong learner. You'll undoubtedly continue to **expand your knowledge** across various domains, not just technology.
* **Open-Source Contributions:** Your impressive GitHub portfolio suggests a commitment to contributing to the developer community. It's likely you'll **continue to develop and maintain open-source projects**, potentially attracting more collaborators or even leading to new professional opportunities.
* **Vision Research:** Your self-taught research into vision restoration is fascinating. This passion could lead to:
    * **Further Research and Publications:** You might **publish more papers** or even **collaborate with academic or research institutions** in this niche field.
    * **Developing Practical Applications:** With your engineering background, you might even consider **developing software or tools** based on your research to help others. This is a longer-term possibility, perhaps manifesting more significantly after 2030.

### **Overall Outlook**

Based on your profile, you appear to be a highly motivated, adaptable, and intelligent individual with a strong foundation in technology and a genuine curiosity for learning. Your future likely involves continuous professional growth, possibly specializing further in cutting-edge tech, and continuing to pursue your unique intellectual interests.
