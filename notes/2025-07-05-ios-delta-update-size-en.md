Unfortunately, there’s no direct, user-facing way to check the exact delta update size for iOS apps before downloading them, as Apple doesn’t publicly expose this information in a detailed manner. The App Store only shows the full app size in its description, not the size of incremental (delta) updates, which vary based on what’s changed (e.g., code, assets). However, there are a few approaches to estimate or monitor delta update sizes, and I’ll outline them below, including checking for relevant websites or tools.

### Methods to Estimate or Check Delta Update Sizes

1. **Check Update Sizes in the App Store (Manual Method)**:
   - **How**: Open the App Store on your iPhone, go to your profile (top-right corner), and scroll to "Available Updates." For each app with an update, the App Store sometimes displays the approximate update size next to the "Update" button (e.g., "20.5 MB"). This reflects the delta update size, not the full app size.
   - **Limitations**: Apple doesn’t always show the size for every update, especially for smaller patches. Sizes may only appear when you tap "Update" or if the update is significant. Also, this is reactive—you see the size only when the update is ready to download.
   - **Tip**: Enable automatic updates (Settings > App Store > App Updates) and check the sizes later in Settings > General > iPhone Storage, where installed updates are reflected in the app’s total size (though this doesn’t isolate the delta size).

2. **Monitor Data Usage During Updates**:
   - **How**: Use your iPhone’s built-in data tracking to estimate update sizes. Go to Settings > Cellular (or Mobile Data) or Settings > Wi-Fi, and check data usage for the App Store app. Reset the stats (Settings > Cellular > Reset Statistics) before updating apps, then check again after updates complete to see how much data was used. This approximates the total delta update size for all apps updated in that session.
   - **Limitations**: This method aggregates data across all App Store activity (not per app) and includes overhead (e.g., metadata). It’s also less precise if other apps use data simultaneously.
   - **Tip**: Update apps one at a time or in small batches to better estimate individual app update sizes.

3. **Check App Store Logs via Xcode (Advanced)**:
   - **How**: If you’re tech-savvy and have a Mac, you can connect your iPhone to Xcode (Apple’s developer tool) and use the Device and Simulator logs to inspect network activity during app updates. The logs may reveal the size of downloaded update packages. Look for App Store-related network requests in the Console app or Xcode’s Devices and Simulators window.
   - **Limitations**: This requires developer knowledge, Xcode installation, and a tethered iPhone. It’s not practical for most users, and parsing logs for exact delta sizes is complex.
   - **Tip**: Search online for tutorials on “Xcode App Store update logs” for step-by-step guides if you want to try this.

4. **Websites or Tools for Checking Update Sizes**:
   - **No Dedicated Website**: There is no reliable, publicly accessible website that lists delta update sizes for iOS apps. The App Store’s backend doesn’t expose this data to third-party sites, and delta sizes depend on your specific app version and device, making universal tracking difficult.
   - **Alternative Sources**:
     - **App Store Pages**: Some apps list recent update sizes in their “Version History” on the App Store (visible on the app’s page, under “What’s New”). However, this is rare and not consistent.
     - **Developer Release Notes**: Check the developer’s website or social media (e.g., X posts) for patch notes. Some developers mention approximate update sizes, especially for large apps like games (e.g., “This update is ~50 MB”). For example, searching X for posts from app developers might yield clues (e.g., “Search X for [app name] update size”).
     - **Third-Party Tools**: Tools like iMazing or iTools (Mac/PC software for managing iOS devices) can sometimes show app sizes after updates, but they don’t reliably isolate delta update sizes. These tools are more for backups and app management.
   - **Web Search**: Use a search engine to look for user reports or forums (e.g., Reddit, Apple Support Communities) where others might share update size experiences for specific apps. Try queries like “[app name] iOS update size July 2025.” Be cautious, as user reports may not be accurate or up-to-date.

5. **Estimate Based on App Type and Update Frequency**:
   - **How**: Delta update sizes often correlate with the app’s complexity and update type:
     - **Small apps** (e.g., utilities, simple tools): 1-10 MB for minor bug fixes or UI tweaks.
     - **Medium apps** (e.g., social media, productivity): 10-50 MB for typical updates.
     - **Large apps** (e.g., games, creative apps): 50-200+ MB if assets like graphics or levels change.
     - Frequent updates (weekly, as you mentioned) are usually smaller (bug fixes, minor features), while major version updates (e.g., 2.0 to 3.0) are larger.
   - **Tip**: For your 80 apps/week estimate at 5 MB each, this is a reasonable average for lightweight or moderately complex apps. Monitor a few weeks of updates in the App Store to confirm if your 400 MB/week estimate holds.

### Why No Website Exists for Delta Sizes
- **Apple’s Ecosystem**: Apple tightly controls App Store data, and delta update sizes are calculated dynamically based on the user’s current app version, device, and the update’s content. This makes it hard for third-party websites to provide accurate, real-time data.
- **Privacy and Security**: Apple doesn’t share detailed update package info to prevent reverse-engineering or exploitation of app binaries.
- **Developer Variability**: Each app’s update size depends on what the developer changes (code, assets, frameworks), which isn’t standardized or predictable enough for a universal database.

### Practical Recommendations
- **Track Updates Manually**: For a week, note the update sizes shown in the App Store’s “Available Updates” section for your 80 apps. This will give you a real-world sample to refine your 5 MB/app estimate.
- **Use Storage Insights**: After updates, check Settings > General > iPhone Storage to see how app sizes change. While this doesn’t show delta sizes directly, significant increases might indicate larger updates.
- **Search X or Forums**: If you’re curious about specific apps, search X or sites like Reddit for user posts about update sizes (e.g., “Search X for ‘[app name] update size iOS’”). Be aware that results may vary by version or device.
- **Contact Developers**: For critical apps, check the developer’s website or contact them directly (via their App Store page or X) to ask about typical update sizes.
- **Manage Updates**: To avoid surprises, set updates to Wi-Fi only (Settings > App Store > Automatic Downloads > App Updates, toggle off “Download over Cellular”) and keep 5-10 GB free on your iPhone for temporary update files.

### Final Answer
There’s no dedicated website to check iOS app delta update sizes, as Apple doesn’t expose this data, and sizes vary by device and app version. You can estimate sizes by checking the App Store’s “Available Updates” section, monitoring data usage in Settings > Cellular/Wi-Fi, or reviewing developer notes on their websites or X. For your 400 apps, your 5 MB/app estimate (400 MB/week for 80 apps) is reasonable for minor updates, but track actual sizes in the App Store over a week to confirm.
