Dr. Norman Dwight Megill (1950-2021) was a highly influential figure in the field of formal mathematics and automated proof verification, best known as the primary author and driving force behind the **Metamath** project. His work centered on creating a uniquely simple yet powerful system for expressing and rigorously verifying mathematical proofs by computer.

**The Metamath Project:**

Metamath is a computer language and an associated program designed for archiving, verifying, and studying mathematical proofs with absolute rigor. What sets Metamath apart is its foundational simplicity:

* **Minimalist Language:** The Metamath language is incredibly lean, with an almost total absence of hard-wired syntax. It provides a foundational framework for expressing essentially all of mathematics through a small set of basic rules, primarily based on textual substitution. This simplicity makes its proofs highly transparent and amenable to independent verification by various tools.
* **Axiom Agnostic:** Metamath is not tied to any specific set of axioms. Instead, axioms are defined within a "database" (a text file of axioms and theorems). This flexibility allows different axiomatic systems to be formalized and explored. The most prominent database, `set.mm`, constructs mathematics from scratch, primarily based on ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice) and classical first-order logic.
* **Comprehensive Proof Steps:** A hallmark of Metamath proofs is their meticulous detail. Every single step in a Metamath proof is explicitly stated, with each step being an application of an axiom or a previously proven statement. This contrasts with many other proof systems that might use "tactics" or "automation" which obscure the underlying proof steps. This exhaustive approach ensures unparalleled precision and eliminates the possibility of human error in verification.
* **Independent Verification:** The simplicity of the Metamath language has enabled numerous independent proof verifiers to be implemented in various programming languages, further enhancing the trustworthiness of proofs.

**Norman Megill's Contributions:**

Norman Megill's vision and dedication were instrumental in the development and proliferation of Metamath:

* **Author of the Metamath Language:** He conceived and developed the minimalist Metamath language, which allows for the expression of complex mathematical theorems and their proofs in a form verifiable by a computer.
* **Primary Author of the Metamath Program:** He created the original Metamath program (a C-based command-line tool) that can read, verify, modify, and output Metamath databases.
* **Cultivator of the Metamath Community:** Over three decades, Megill fostered an international community of mathematicians, logicians, and computer scientists who shared the dream of digitizing and formally verifying mathematics. His encouragement and technical judgment were vital in building this collaborative environment.
* **Formalization of Mathematics:** He spearheaded the creation and expansion of the Metamath Proof Explorer (MPE) database (`set.mm`), which contains tens of thousands of rigorously proven theorems, covering vast areas of mathematics. This database is a significant achievement in formalizing mathematical knowledge.
* **Authored "Metamath: A Computer Language for Mathematical Proofs":** In 2019, he co-authored this book with David A. Wheeler, providing a comprehensive explanation of the Metamath language and program, with a particular focus on the fundamentals of the MPE database.
* **Research in Logic and Physics:** Beyond Metamath, Megill also engaged in research related to quantum logic and Hilbert spaces, using Metamath to formalize his investigations into properties like Kochen-Specker sets, which are relevant to quantum contextuality. He also contributed to the understanding of finite axiom-schematizations of classical first-order logic.

Norman Megill received his undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 1972 and his Ph.D. from the University of Zagreb, Croatia, in 2010. He passed away suddenly in December 2021, leaving a profound legacy in the field of formal methods and the ongoing endeavor to achieve absolute certainty in mathematics through computational verification. His work with Metamath continues to influence formal mathematics and serves as a testament to the power of simplicity and rigor in tackling complex intellectual challenges.
