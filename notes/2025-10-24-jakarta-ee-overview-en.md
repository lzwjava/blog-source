Jakarta EE is an open-source platform for developing enterprise-level Java applications. It provides a set of specifications, APIs, and tools that extend the core Java SE (Standard Edition) to handle complex tasks like web services, distributed computing, cloud-native deployments, and scalable server-side applications.

### Brief History
- Originally known as Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) and later Java EE, it was developed by Oracle/Sun Microsystems.
- In 2017, Oracle donated the technologies to the Eclipse Foundation, leading to the rebranding as Jakarta EE (named after Jakarta, Indonesia, where the first Eclipse Java conference was held).
- This shift made it fully open-source and community-driven, fostering faster innovation and broader adoption.

### Key Features and Purpose
- **Components**: Includes APIs for servlets, JPA (Java Persistence API) for data access, CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for managing dependencies, JAX-RS for RESTful web services, and more.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for building robust, secure, and portable enterprise software, such as e-commerce platforms, financial systems, and microservices architectures.
- **Current Status**: As of 2025, Jakarta EE 11 is the latest major release, emphasizing cloud-native compatibility, JSON processing, and improved security. It's supported by servers like Open Liberty, Payara, and WildFly.
