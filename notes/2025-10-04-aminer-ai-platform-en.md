### Introduction to AMiner (https://www.aminer.cn)

AMiner is an AI-powered academic search and mining platform developed by researchers at Tsinghua University in China. Launched as a next-generation tool for scientific and technological intelligence, it focuses on analyzing and mining large-scale academic social networks and scholarly data. The platform leverages advanced AI techniques to model and explore "big scholar data," helping users navigate vast amounts of research publications, author profiles, and collaboration networks. It's particularly strong in fields like computer science, AI, and related disciplines, but extends to broader academic exploration.

### What Can It Do?

AMiner offers a range of tools and services tailored for researchers, scientists, and academics. Key capabilities include:

- **Researcher Profile Search and Semantic Matching**: Build detailed, AI-enhanced profiles of scholars based on publications, citations, and affiliations. It uses semantic analysis to connect users with relevant experts and collaborators.
  
- **Expert Finding and Ranking**: Identify top influencers in specific fields (e.g., via lists like the "AI 2000 Most Influential Scholars") using metrics like h-index, citations, and impact scores.

- **Conference and Venue Analysis**: Explore academic conferences, journals, and events with insights into trends, rankings, and participation data.

- **Paper and Patent Search**: Retrieve and track scholarly articles, patents, and literature with advanced filtering, including keyword, author, or topic-based queries. Features like sub-graph search allow drilling into specific networks or citation chains.

- **Course and Resource Discovery**: Search for educational content, courses, and related resources tied to academic topics.

- **Network Mining and Visualization**: Analyze collaboration graphs, co-authorship patterns, and social networks within academia, supporting tasks like trend prediction and recommendation.

Overall, it's designed to streamline academic discovery, from basic searches to deep data mining, making it a valuable resource for staying updated in fast-evolving fields like AI.
