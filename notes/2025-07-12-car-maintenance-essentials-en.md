### Essentials for the Drive and Car Maintenance
Since you're driving about 870 km (roughly 10 hours direct, but spread over 5 days with stops), prioritize safety and reliability. China's expressways (like the G15 Shenhai) have tolls, so bring cash or an ETC card. Check your car's condition before leaving Guangzhou.

- Valid driver's license, vehicle registration, and insurance documents.
- Spare tire, jack, tire iron, and basic toolkit (wrenches, screwdrivers).
- Jumper cables, flashlight (with extra batteries), and reflective warning triangles.
- Emergency roadside kit (flares, tow rope).
- Car charger for phones and devices.
- Dashcam (common in China for disputes).
- Cash for tolls (around 400-500 RMB total) and fuel (expect 600-800 RMB for gas).
- Full tank of gas from Guangzhou; refuel at service areas.

### Sleeping in the Car Gear
Sleeping in your car in China is feasible at highway service areas (which have 24/7 parking, restrooms, and security), but avoid urban streets or remote spots for safety. July weather is hot and humid (highs 32-35°C, lows 24-27°C, with rain), so focus on ventilation and comfort. Park in well-lit areas, lock doors, and use shades for privacy.

- Inflatable mattress or sleeping pad that fits your car's backseat/trunk.
- Sleeping bag (lightweight, rated for warm weather) or blankets.
- Pillow (inflatable or compact).
- Window shades, screens, or curtains for privacy and to block light/heat (also mosquito netting for ventilation without bugs).
- Portable fan (battery-powered) or crack windows slightly for airflow (but use rain guards if needed).
- Earplugs and eye mask for noise/light from service areas.

### Clothing and Personal Items
Pack light, breathable items for the heat and humidity. Expect showers/thunderstorms daily (70-100% chance in the first few days), so quick-dry fabrics. Bring 5-7 days' worth, assuming laundry access isn't easy.

- 5-7 pairs of underwear and socks (quick-dry).
- 3-4 lightweight t-shirts or tank tops.
- 2-3 pairs of shorts or breathable pants (hiking-style for stops).
- 1-2 long-sleeve shirts for sun/insect protection.
- Swimsuit (for beach stops like in Xiamen).
- Flip-flops or sandals for quick stops/showers.
- Packable rain jacket or poncho.
- Hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen (SPF 50+).
- Lightweight jacket or hoodie for cooler evenings/AC in car.

### Food and Water
Stock up in Guangzhou supermarkets (e.g., Walmart or local markets) for non-perishables. Service areas have hot food, but bring snacks for the road. Hydrate heavily—aim for 3-4 liters of water daily in the heat.

- Reusable water bottles or jugs (5-10 liters total; refill at service areas).
- Cooler bag with ice packs for perishables.
- Non-perishable snacks: nuts, dried fruits, instant noodles, energy bars.
- Portable stove or electric kettle (if your car has an inverter) for hot water/meals.
- Basic utensils: plates, cups, cutlery, and trash bags.
- Fruits, bread, or ready meals for the first day.

### Health, Hygiene, and First Aid
Hygiene is key when sleeping in the car—use service area restrooms/showers. Mosquitoes and heat rash are risks in Fujian summers.

- Toiletries: toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, shampoo, soap.
- Baby wipes, hand sanitizer, and toilet paper (essentials for quick clean-ups).
- Towel (quick-dry microfiber).
- First aid kit: bandages, antiseptic, pain relievers (ibuprofen), anti-diarrhea meds, motion sickness pills.
- Insect repellent (DEET-based) and anti-itch cream.
- Prescription meds, plus extras for allergies or stomach issues (common with road food).
- Face masks and disinfectant wipes (for crowded stops).

### Navigation, Tech, and Entertainment
Use apps like Baidu Maps or Gaode for real-time traffic (better than Google in China). Download offline maps.

- Smartphone with charger, power bank (10,000mAh+), and car mount.
- GPS device or app downloads for the route (Guangzhou → Chaozhou → Xiamen → Quanzhou → Fuzhou suggested for scenic stops).
- Entertainment: books, podcasts, or offline music/movies.
- Portable Wi-Fi or extra SIM data for updates.

### Miscellaneous and Safety
For a 5-day trip, plan stops like Chaozhou (temples), Xiamen (beaches), and Quanzhou (historical sites) to break the drive. Total distance allows 150-200 km/day. Check for typhoon warnings—July is peak season.

- Multi-tool or Swiss Army knife.
- Duct tape and zip ties for quick fixes.
- Umbrella for rain.
- Notebook and pen for notes/trip log.
- Emergency cash (1000-2000 RMB) and ID copies.
- Pepper spray or personal alarm (if legal and needed for safety).
