## Leading Chinese LLMs in September 2025

### 1. **DeepSeek-V3 / R1**

* **DeepSeek-V3** (Mixture-of-Experts design, \~250 B parameters) delivers top-tier performance with efficiency in compute. ([Second Talent][1], [Index.dev][2])
* **DeepSeek-R1**, its cost-effective, open-source sibling, has turned heads globally for outperforming Western counterparts on reasoning and reasoning-heavy tasks despite a tiny budget. ([The Guardian][3], [TIME][4], [The Sun][5])

### 2. **Qwen Family (Alibaba Cloud)**

* **Qwen 3** (dense and sparse variants up to 235B parameters, with 128K token context window) released mid–2025, licensed Apache-2.0. ([Wikipedia][6])
* Ranked very high globally—beat many Western models in benchmarks. ([Wikipedia][6], [TechWire Asia][7])

### 3. **Kimi K2 (Moonshot AI)**

* **Kimi K2**, launched July 2025, is a trillion-parameter MoE model (active 32B) with open weights and licensing under a modified MIT license. ([Wikipedia][8])
* Among top models globally; mentioned by technical observers and included among widely used open weights. ([Simon Willison’s Weblog][9], [Wikipedia][8])

### 4. **GLM-4.5 / GLM-4.5V (Zhipu AI / Z.ai)**

* **GLM-4.5** (SOTA on common benchmarks) released mid–2025; **GLM-4.5V**, a 106B vision-language model, launched August 2025. ([Wikipedia][10])
* GLM-4.5 is now positioned as a credible cost-effective alternative to Claude, especially within China. ([Reuters][11])

### 5. **Ernie X1 & Ernie 4.5 (Baidu)**

* **Ernie X1**, a reasoning-focused model, and **Ernie 4.5**, a multimodal model outperforming GPT-4.5 at a fraction of the cost—both introduced in early 2025 and set for open-source release by June. ([Business Insider][12], [Wikipedia][13])

### 6. **Yi (01.AI)**

* **Yi-34B** was recognized early on among top pre-trained base LLMs globally. ([Wikipedia][14])
* **Yi-Coder** (up to 128K token context length) and **Yi-Lightning** are optimized for coding and efficiency. ([Wikipedia][14])

### 7. **Wu Dao 3.0, GLM-4 Plus (ChatGLM), Doubao 1.5 Pro, Kimi k1.5**

* Earlier-generation but still relevant for certain use cases:

  * **Wu Dao 3.0**
  * **ChatGLM (GLM-4 Plus)**
  * **Doubao 1.5 Pro**
  * **Kimi k1.5**
    All are recognized as strong, open-source predecessors with good multilingual and reasoning capabilities. ([Index.dev][15])

### 8. **dots.llm1 (Rednote / Xiaohongshu)**

* A newcomer in 2025, released as open-source, performing on par with Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5 in coding—but trailing behind DeepSeek-V3. ([Reuters][16])

## Quick Summary (Narrative Style)

* **DeepSeek-V3 / R1**: Chart-topping in both performance and affordability.
* **Qwen 3**: Alibaba’s flagship open-axis model family dominating benchmarks.
* **Kimi K2**: Moonshot AI’s MoE, trillion-parameter, open-licensed workhorse.
* **GLM-4.5 / 4.5V (Zhipu/Z.ai)**: SOTA on benchmarks and appealing for Claude migration.
* **Baidu’s Ernie X1 & 4.5**: Performance-efficient rivals, soon open-source.
* **Yi series (01.AI)**: Efficient, long-context models with strong coding prowess.
* **Earlier models (Wu Dao, ChatGLM, etc.)**: Still doing heavy lifting in specialized contexts.
* **dots.llm1**: Emerging, notable open model from a social-media player.

## Why This Matters

China’s AI scene in 2025 is defined by **performance, openness, and cost-effectiveness**. Models like DeepSeek and Kimi undercut Western giants on price while maintaining high accuracy; Alibaba’s Qwen family continues to set benchmarks; Zhipu and Baidu increasingly open their innovations. The shift toward open models is accelerating, as Chinese developers and government strategies focus on broad domestic adoption and global competitiveness.
