It's impossible to definitively say who the "best" painter in history is because art appreciation is subjective. What one person considers the pinnacle of artistic achievement, another might find less appealing.

However, we can identify painters who are consistently recognized for their exceptional skill, innovation, and lasting influence on the history of art. Here are some artists frequently cited as being among the greatest:

**Renaissance Masters:**

* **Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519):** A true polymath, da Vinci's mastery extended to painting, drawing, engineering, science, and more. His works like the "Mona Lisa" and "The Last Supper" are iconic for their technical brilliance, psychological depth, and innovative compositions.
* **Michelangelo (1475-1564):** Primarily known as a sculptor, Michelangelo's painting achievements, most notably the Sistine Chapel ceiling, demonstrate his unparalleled understanding of human anatomy, dramatic composition, and powerful emotional expression.
* **Raphael (1483-1520):** Celebrated for the harmony, balance, and classical beauty of his compositions, such as "The School of Athens." He was a master of perspective and graceful figuration.

**Baroque Period:**

* **Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669):** A Dutch master renowned for his dramatic use of light and shadow (chiaroscuro), his ability to capture human emotion and psychology in his portraits and biblical scenes, and his innovative etching techniques.
* **Johannes Vermeer (1632-1675):** Known for his small but exquisite domestic interior scenes, Vermeer masterfully depicted light, color, and serene atmospheres. His "Girl with a Pearl Earring" is a prime example of his captivating work.

**Post-Impressionism:**

* **Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890):** His emotionally charged and expressive use of color and brushstrokes had a profound influence on 20th-century art. Works like "The Starry Night" and his self-portraits are intensely personal and visually striking.
* **Paul Cézanne (1839-1906):** Often seen as a bridge between Impressionism and Cubism, Cézanne's innovative approach to form, perspective, and the use of color laid the groundwork for modern art.

**Modern Art:**

* **Pablo Picasso (1881-1973):** A revolutionary figure who co-founded Cubism and constantly reinvented his style. His prolific and diverse body of work profoundly impacted the development of 20th-century art.
* **Claude Monet (1840-1926):** A key figure in the Impressionist movement, Monet dedicated his career to capturing the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere on landscapes, most famously in his "Water Lilies" series.

**Other Highly Influential Painters:**

* **Titian (c. 1488-1576):** A Venetian master known for his rich colors, sensual figures, and expressive brushwork.
* **Diego Velázquez (1599-1660):** A Spanish Baroque painter celebrated for his realism, complex compositions, and masterful use of light, as seen in "Las Meninas."
* **Frida Kahlo (1907-1954):** A Mexican painter whose intensely personal and symbolic self-portraits explored themes of identity, pain, and culture.

Ultimately, the "best" painter is a matter of individual taste and the criteria used for evaluation. Each of these artists, and many more, have contributed uniquely and significantly to the vast and rich history of painting.
