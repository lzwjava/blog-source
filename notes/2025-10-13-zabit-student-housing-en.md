### Ziroom and ZABIT in Hong Kong

Ziroom is a major Chinese apartment rental platform known for furnished, hassle-free long-term rentals. They've recently expanded internationally through **ZABIT**, a dedicated platform for global students (especially Chinese students studying abroad). ZABIT launched in mid-2024 and focuses on high-quality, vetted properties in key cities like Hong Kong and the UK. In Hong Kong, they offer around 10,000 units, including shared rooms, studios, and apartments near universities and city centers. It's designed for easy booking with 24/7 support, no hidden fees, and direct pricing.

### Rent Prices on ZABIT in HK
Specific listings on ZABIT aren't publicly detailed in reviews yet (it's a new platform), but based on their student-focused model and similar providers, prices are competitive for quality student housing. Hong Kong's overall rental market is expensive due to high demand, but student options keep costs lower through shared setups.

- **General student accommodation range in HK**: HK$5,000–15,000 per month (about US$640–1,920). This varies by location (e.g., cheaper in New Territories, pricier in Central/Hong Kong Island), room type, and inclusions like utilities/WiFi.
  - **Shared/triple room**: HK$6,000–7,000 per bed (affordable dorm-style).
  - **Double/shared room**: HK$8,000–10,000 per person.
  - **Private single/studio**: HK$12,000–18,000+ for a small 1-bedroom.

ZABIT emphasizes "no price difference" from direct bookings and quality properties, so expect mid-range pricing with perks like furnished units and flexible leases (6–12 months). For comparison:
- A private room in central HK via similar platforms (e.g., Habyt) starts at ~HK$13,300/month.
- Budget student dorms can dip to HK$6,355 for a triple-share bed.

Overall, it's pricey compared to mainland China (where Ziroom averages ~CNY 3,000–5,000/month), but reasonable for HK's market—especially for students avoiding scams or overpriced agents. Demand from mainland students has pushed prices up 10–20% in 2025, so book early. Check ZABIT's site for real-time offers.
