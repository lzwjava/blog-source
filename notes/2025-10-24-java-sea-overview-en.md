### Introduction to the Java Sea

The Java Sea (Indonesian: *Laut Jawa*; Javanese: *Segara Jawa*) is a vast, shallow marginal sea in Southeast Asia, forming part of the Sunda Shelf. It lies between the Indonesian islands of Borneo (Kalimantan) to the north, Java to the south, Sumatra to the west, and Sulawesi to the east. Centered around 5°S 110°E, it connects to the South China Sea via the Karimata Strait and is typically considered an extension of the western Pacific Ocean, though sometimes grouped with the Indian Ocean.

#### Geography
Spanning about 320,000 km² (with a maximum length of 1,600 km east-west and width of 380 km north-south), the Java Sea is remarkably shallow, averaging just 46 meters in depth, with a flat seabed shaped by rising sea levels at the end of the last Ice Age. It receives freshwater from major rivers like the Barito, Bengawan Solo, and Citarum, influencing its brackish waters and rich sediment load. Key islands include Bangka, Belitung, Kangean, and the Thousand Islands near Jakarta, alongside protected areas like Karimunjawa National Park.

#### Ecology and Importance
The sea supports diverse marine life, including coral reefs, mangroves, and fisheries vital to Indonesia's economy. It's a biodiversity hotspot but faces threats from overfishing, pollution, and climate change.

#### Historical Significance
The Java Sea is infamous for the Battle of the Java Sea in February–March 1942, a pivotal World War II naval clash where Allied forces suffered heavy losses against Japan. More recently, it's been the site of tragic aviation incidents, including the crashes of AirAsia Flight 8501 (2014), Lion Air Flight 610 (2018), and Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 (2021).

This sea plays a crucial role in regional trade, navigation, and Indonesia's maritime heritage.
