To optimize the cost-effectiveness and advanced capabilities of the model configuration, you should consider balancing model performance with pricing. Here's a potential configuration based on your requirements:

### Key Considerations:

* **Cost-Effectiveness:** Selecting models that are affordable for everyday usage but can handle complex tasks efficiently.
* **Advanced Features:** Ensuring that the models you choose can handle tasks such as long context processing, complex reasoning, or web search integration.

### Proposed Configuration:

```json
{
  "Router": {
    "default": "openrouter,gemini-2.5-flash",  // Cost-effective for most use cases
    "background": "openrouter,gemini-2.5-flash",  // Low-cost, efficient for background tasks
    "think": "openrouter,claude-sonnet-4",  // Slightly more advanced for thinking tasks
    "longContext": "openrouter,gemini-2.5-pro",  // Advanced for handling large contexts
    "longContextThreshold": 60000,  // Set for contexts over 60k tokens
    "webSearch": "openrouter,claude-sonnet-4"  // Reliable and advanced for web search tasks
  }
}
```

### Explanation:

* **"default"** and **"background"**: Using **Gemini 2.5 Flash** is a great choice for regular and background tasks, as it offers a balance between cost and performance, while still maintaining decent speed.
* **"think"**: **Claude Sonnet 4** is selected here because it provides enhanced performance for reasoning tasks at a reasonable price. It's more advanced than the base models.
* **"longContext"**: **Gemini 2.5 Pro** is better suited for handling longer contexts, as it typically offers larger context windows with better performance.
* **"webSearch"**: **Claude Sonnet 4** is good for web search tasks due to its ability to process and understand context efficiently, while offering advanced capabilities for dealing with web data.

This configuration allows you to use cost-effective models where performance is not as critical, while reserving the more advanced models for tasks like thinking, handling large contexts, and web searches.
