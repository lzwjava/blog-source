No, the Neta V 400 Chao Lite does not support keeping internal electricity on (such as for USB ports or power outlets) while the car is fully locked and left unattended for an extended period like an hour. Based on available information from user manuals, reviews, and comparisons with similar Chinese EVs (e.g., Ora Good Cat), the accessory power typically remains active only for a short time (around 4-5 minutes) after turning off the vehicle and locking it, before the car enters sleep mode to conserve the 12V battery. After that, USB ports and internal outlets shut off to avoid drainage.

If you leave the car in "Ready" mode or accessory mode to keep power on, it generally prevents locking from outside for safety reasons, as the system auto-shuts down upon exit and locking via the door handle button. For charging a phone while away, consider using the vehicle's external V2L (vehicle-to-load) feature if equipped (up to 3.3kW for small appliances), but this is for external use only, not internal. Always check the specific user manual for your model or consult a dealer for any firmware updates or accessories that might enable timed power retention.
