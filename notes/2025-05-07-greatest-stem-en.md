### Programming/Computer Science
- **Tim Berners-Lee** (b. 1955, UK): Inventor of the World Wide Web, Berners-Lee revolutionized how we access and share information. His work at CERN in 1989 laid the foundation for modern internet technology, and he continues to advocate for digital ethics and open data.[](https://beckchris.com/science-nature-technology/greatest-scientists-of-all-time/)[](https://www.parametricstudioinc.com/blog/10-stem-professionals-who-changed-the-world)
- **Donald Knuth** (b. 1938, USA): A pioneer in computer science, Knuth authored *The Art of Computer Programming*, a seminal work in algorithms and programming. His contributions to typesetting (TeX) and theoretical computer science remain critical. He’s still active, refining his magnum opus at Stanford.[](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/most-influential-scientists/)

### Broader STEM Impact
- **Shinya Yamanaka** (b. 1962, Japan): A 2012 Nobel laureate in Medicine, Yamanaka discovered how to reprogram adult cells into stem cells (iPSCs), transforming regenerative medicine. His work blends chemistry, biology, and medical science, with ongoing applications in disease treatment.[](https://bigthink.com/the-present/top-ten-greatest-scientists-alive-today/)[](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/most-influential-scientists/)
- **Elon Musk** (b. 1971, South Africa/USA): While not a traditional scientist, Musk’s engineering and programming contributions through SpaceX (reusable rockets) and Tesla (AI-driven electric vehicles) redefine applied STEM. His work on neural interfaces (Neuralink) and AI (xAI) pushes interdisciplinary boundaries, though his public persona sparks debate.

### Notes
- **Why these names?** These individuals have made transformative contributions, often recognized by Nobel Prizes, Fields Medals, or global impact (e.g., CRISPR, the Web). They’re active or recently active, influencing their fields today. For example, Witten and Tao excel in theoretical depth, while Doudna and Berners-Lee have changed practical applications.
- **Gaps?** Many fields (e.g., biology, engineering) and unsung heroes (e.g., Gladys West for GPS) deserve mention, but I focused on your specified areas. Women and minorities are underrepresented, reflecting historical STEM barriers, though Doudna and others break this mold.[](https://www.pbs.org/education/blogs/pbs-in-the-classroom/ten-black-scientists-that-science-teachers-should-know-about/)
- **Skepticism of “greatest” claims**: Rankings like “greatest” can oversimplify. Perelman’s reclusiveness contrasts with Hawking’s fame (d. 2018, so excluded), yet both are monumental. Impact varies by metric—pure discovery vs. societal change.
- **Sources**: I’ve cross-referenced web data (e.g., Nobel records, academic profiles) and X posts for sentiment, ensuring no single source dominates. Citations like or point to vetted info, but I’ve avoided over-relying on any one narrative.[](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/most-influential-scientists/)

If you want a deeper dive into one field, specific names, or emerging scientists, let me know! I can also analyze X profiles for public perception or search for real-time updates on these figures.
