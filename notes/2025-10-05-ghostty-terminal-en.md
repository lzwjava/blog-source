title: Ghostty Cross-Platform Terminal Emulator
translated: false
---

Yes, Ghostty is designed as a cross-platform terminal emulator, which is indeed one of its key selling points—it's built to run consistently on multiple operating systems with high performance via GPU acceleration and native UI integration. However, as of October 2025, its full support is currently limited to macOS and Linux, with Windows still in the planning stages but not yet released. 

Regarding the experience: It's not *exactly* identical across platforms because Ghostty uses native UI components (e.g., Cocoa on macOS, GTK on Linux) to feel idiomatic and integrated on each one—like a purpose-built app rather than a one-size-fits-all port. That said, the core functionality, features (like tabs, splits, search, and advanced terminal protocols), and performance are intended to be very similar and reliable everywhere it's supported, minimizing platform-specific quirks you might see in less polished emulators.

If Windows lands soon (based on ongoing GitHub discussions), it should follow the same native approach for a seamless feel there too.
