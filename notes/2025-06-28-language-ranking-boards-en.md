You can find programming language ranking boards on several reputable websites that track language popularity based on various metrics like search engine hits, developer surveys, and job listings. Here are some of the most reliable sources:

1. **TIOBE Index**  
   - **Website**: [www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index)  
   - **Description**: Updated monthly, the TIOBE Index ranks programming languages based on search engine queries across 25 platforms, including Google, Bing, and Wikipedia. It’s a widely recognized indicator of language popularity, though it focuses on search volume rather than actual usage or code written.[](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)

2. **PYPL Index (PopularitY of Programming Language)**  
   - **Website**: [pypl.github.io/PYPL.html](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html)  
   - **Description**: The PYPL Index analyzes how often language tutorials are searched on Google, providing insight into developer interest. It’s updated monthly and includes rankings for specific countries like the US, India, and Germany.[](https://statisticstimes.com/tech/top-computer-languages.php)

3. **IEEE Spectrum Top Programming Languages**  
   - **Website**: [spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages)  
   - **Description**: IEEE Spectrum provides annual rankings with multiple perspectives, including a "Spectrum" ranking for IEEE members, a "Trending" ranking for emerging languages, and a "Jobs" ranking based on employer demand. It aggregates data from sources like GitHub, Stack Overflow, and job boards.[](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2024)

4. **RedMonk Programming Language Rankings**  
   - **Website**: [redmonk.com](https://redmonk.com)  
   - **Description**: Released biannually, RedMonk ranks languages by combining GitHub repository activity (code usage) and Stack Overflow discussions (developer engagement). It’s useful for spotting trends in developer communities but may be less reliable due to declining Stack Overflow activity.[](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2024/09/12/language-rankings-6-24/)

5. **Stack Overflow Developer Survey**  
   - **Website**: [survey.stackoverflow.co](https://survey.stackoverflow.co)  
   - **Description**: Conducted annually, this survey polls developers worldwide on the languages they use and prefer. It’s a great source for understanding real-world usage, with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, SQL, and TypeScript topping the 2024 list.[](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology)

6. **GitHub Octoverse**  
   - **Website**: [octoverse.github.com](https://octoverse.github.com)  
   - **Description**: GitHub’s annual report ranks languages based on repository activity and contributions. It highlights languages like JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript, with insights into fast-growing languages like Go and Rust.[](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages)

These sources vary in methodology, so the rankings differ slightly. For example, TIOBE and PYPL emphasize search trends, while RedMonk and GitHub focus on code and community activity. If you’re looking for a specific type of ranking (e.g., job demand or emerging trends), let me know, and I can suggest the best source!
