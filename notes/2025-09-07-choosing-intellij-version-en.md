From your `uname -a` output:

```
Linux to 6.8.0-60-generic ... x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

That `x86_64` means your CPU architecture is **64-bit Intel/AMD (x86-64)**, not ARM.

So when downloading IntelliJ IDEA (or any JetBrains IDE), you should pick the **Linux (x64 / x86-64)** version, not the ARM64 one.

The **Linux ARM64** builds are only for devices with ARM processors (like Apple Silicon Macs, some newer servers, or ARM laptops).

👉 In short:

* **Your machine** → `x86_64` → use **Linux x64**
* **Not your machine** → ARM chips (M1/M2 Macs, some ARM servers) → use **Linux ARM64**

Do you want me to also show you a quick command to double-check your CPU type (e.g., `lscpu` or `arch`) so you can be 100% sure?
