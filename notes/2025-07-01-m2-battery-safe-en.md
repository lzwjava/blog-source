title: M2 MacBook Air Safe Plugged In
translated: false
---

Yes, you can absolutely continue to leave your MacBook Air M2 plugged in, even after it's fully charged, without harming the battery. Here's why, and how the M2's battery technology differs from your 2014 MacBook Pro:

**Leaving Your MacBook Air M2 Plugged In:**

Modern MacBooks, including the M2 MacBook Air, have sophisticated battery management systems. When the battery reaches 100%, the laptop essentially bypasses the battery and runs directly off the power adapter. This means:

* **No Overcharging:** The battery won't be continuously "trickle charged" or overcharged, which could degrade its health.
* **Battery Preservation:** In fact, for optimal long-term battery health, Apple recommends that if you regularly use your MacBook plugged in, you enable a feature called "Optimized Battery Charging."

**Optimized Battery Charging (and how to find it):**

This feature learns your charging habits and, if you keep your MacBook plugged in for extended periods, it might pause charging at 80% and only charge to 100% closer to when it anticipates you'll unplug it. This reduces the time the battery spends at a full charge, which can extend its lifespan.

To enable Optimized Battery Charging:

1.  Go to **System Settings** (or System Preferences on older macOS versions).
2.  Click on **Battery**.
3.  Click on the **Battery Health** button.
4.  Make sure **Optimized Battery Charging** is toggled on.

**Improvements in MacBook Air M2 Battery Technology Compared to 2014 MacBook Pro:**

You're right to be concerned about battery swelling, as that was a more common issue with older lithium-ion batteries. The MacBook Air M2 (and other modern Apple laptops) benefits from significant advancements in battery technology and management:

* **Improved Lithium-Polymer Chemistry:** While still lithium-ion based, the specific chemical composition and manufacturing processes have evolved. Modern batteries are more stable and less prone to the gassing that leads to swelling.
* **Advanced Battery Management Systems (BMS):** The M2's integrated BMS is far more sophisticated than what was in your 2014 model. It constantly monitors various parameters like temperature, voltage, and current to optimize charging, discharging, and overall battery health. This includes:
    * **Better Temperature Regulation:** Heat is a major enemy of battery life and can contribute to swelling. Modern Macs have better thermal management to keep battery temperatures within optimal ranges.
    * **Smarter Charging Algorithms:** These algorithms are designed to reduce stress on the battery, such as the Optimized Battery Charging feature mentioned above.
    * **Protection Against Over-Discharge/Over-Charge:** The BMS prevents the battery from being discharged too low or charged too high, both of which can cause damage.
* **Physical Design:** While not directly battery chemistry, the internal design and construction of modern MacBooks also play a role in mitigating the effects of any potential battery expansion, though the primary focus is on preventing it in the first place.

**In summary:**

You can comfortably leave your MacBook Air M2 plugged in with your Baseus 67W GaN Lite charger. The battery management system is designed to protect the battery from overcharging and other stresses. The likelihood of battery swelling, while never zero for any lithium-ion battery, is significantly reduced in the M2 compared to your older 2014 MacBook Pro due to advancements in battery chemistry and sophisticated management systems.
