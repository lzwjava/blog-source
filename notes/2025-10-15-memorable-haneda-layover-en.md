Sounds like a memorable layover at Haneda—those long delays can be a drag, but it's awesome they hooked you up with a free hotel night. Haneda's got a rep for being one of the cleanest and most efficient airports out there, especially compared to some U.S. hubs. The smart toilets with auto-clean features and heated seats? Total game-changer—Japan's all about that high-tech comfort. And polite staff plus solid noodles for around 1,000 yen (that's like $7 USD back then) is a win. Were you craving ramen specifically, or did you try something else from the food court? If you're heading back soon, they've expanded even more since 2017 with new lounges and direct trains to the city. What's your favorite airport memory overall?
