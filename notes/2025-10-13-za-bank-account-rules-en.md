Here’s what I found about **ZA Bank** (Hong Kong virtual bank) opening account rules, especially re: non-HKID holders / travellers, plus how that compares to if you have HKID or are a traveller with travel permit.

## ZA Bank: What official sources say

From ZA Bank’s website / blog:

* They allow **visiting tourists/travellers** to open an account, under certain conditions. ([blog.za.group][1])

* Requirements as a visitor (“訪港旅客”) include:

  1. A valid *mainland China ID card* (Mainland Resident Identity Card) in addition to the *Travel Permit* (往來港澳通行證) with at least **30 days remaining** from the date of account opening; the permit’s *endorsement/stamp* must still be valid on the day of opening. ([blog.za.group][1])
  2. Be physically in Hong Kong at the time of application. ([blog.za.group][1])
  3. A mainland mobile phone number that can receive local (Hong Kong) SMS/phone calls. ([blog.za.group][1])
  4. A mainland bank savings card, and that the phone number tied to that card is the same number you supply in the ZA Bank application. ([blog.za.group][1])

* They also explicitly say you must be **18 or older**. ([blog.za.group][2])

* The opening process is fully via the ZA Bank app; you scan your identity documents, do face verification, fill in address / phone / employment etc. ([blog.za.group][2])

## Key constraints / “must-have” for travellers / non-HKID

Putting the above together, if you're a Chinese citizen with a Travel Permit, these are minimum requirements for ZA Bank in Hong Kong (as of latest info):

| Requirement                                                                                                 | Are you likely to satisfy?                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Valid Travel Permit (往來港澳通行證), valid for ≥ 30 days from application date, with valid endorsement on the day | Yes, if your permit is in order                                                                     |
| Valid Mainland Resident Identity Card                                                                       | Yes, since you mention being a Chinese citizen with travel permit                                   |
| Be physically in Hong Kong while applying                                                                   | You must physically be in Hong Kong when doing the ZA Bank app’s opening flow. ([blog.za.group][1]) |
| Mainland mobile number (able to receive HK SMS/calls)                                                       | Yes, must have a phone you can use locally (or at least receive Hong Kong SMS) ([blog.za.group][1]) |
| Mainland bank savings card linked to that phone number                                                      | Required, as part of identity / financial verification. ([blog.za.group][1])                        |

## Things that ZA Bank probably *does not allow* (or are unclear / more difficult)

* If you **do not** hold HKID (which seems to be your case), some of the identity verification features (like scanning HKID or e-KYC for HKID holders) are *not* applicable. ZA Bank has separate workflows for HKID holders vs visitors. ([blog.za.group][1])
* If your Travel Permit or endorsement is invalid / about to expire <30 days, likely rejected.
* If your phone number or bank savings card is not from mainland / not matching, that might cause trouble.
* Proof of local Hong Kong address might be relevant for some services, but for just opening a ZA Bank account as a visitor they don’t require a Hong Kong address according to their description. ([blog.za.group][1])

## Summary: Can you open ZA Bank with a Travel Permit?

Yes — but only **if** you meet ZA Bank’s “visiting travellers” criteria. Based on your description (“Chinese citizen with Travel Permit”), here is what you'd need to check/ensure:

1. Your Travel Permit is valid ≥ 30 days from the date you apply, and the **endorsement** (the entry permission part) is still valid that day.
2. You also have a valid Mainland Resident ID.
3. You are physically in Hong Kong when opening the account.
4. You have a mainland mobile phone number (that can receive HK-local SMS) and a mainland bank savings card linked to that number.
5. Be ≥18 years old.

If all those are satisfied, you should be able to use the ZA Bank app to open the account (app‐based, eKYC, etc).

If you like, I can check whether there are recent updates (2025) that loosen or tighten these rules, or whether some branches have made exceptions. Do you want me to check that?
