title: Social Meta Tags for SSI
translated: false
---

The code you provided consists of **Open Graph (OG)** and **Twitter Card** meta tags, which are used to control how content is displayed when shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter (now X), and others that support these protocols. These tags are part of the HTML `<head>` section of a website and provide metadata about the page to enhance its presentation in social media feeds.

In this case, the meta tags are for the website of **Safe Superintelligence Inc.** (SSI), accessible at `https://ssi.inc`. Below, I’ll explain what these tags are, how they work, and provide context about Safe Superintelligence Inc. based on the provided information.

### What Are These Meta Tags?

**Open Graph (OG) Meta Tags**:
- Developed by Facebook, Open Graph tags allow websites to define how their content appears when shared on platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and others that support the Open Graph protocol.
- These tags specify key details such as the page’s title, description, image, and URL, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing preview when the link is shared.

**Twitter Card Meta Tags**:
- Twitter Cards are a similar concept used by Twitter (now X) to enrich link previews in tweets or posts.
- They provide metadata to display a summary, image, or other media when a URL is shared on the platform.

Both sets of tags help optimize the user experience by ensuring shared links look professional and provide relevant information, such as a title, description, and image.

### Breakdown of the Meta Tags

Here’s what each tag in your provided code does:

#### Open Graph Tags
1. `<meta property="og:url" content="https://ssi.inc">`
   - Specifies the canonical URL of the page to be shared. This ensures the correct URL is displayed and tracked, avoiding duplicates (e.g., `ssi.inc` vs. `www.ssi.inc`).
   - **Value**: `https://ssi.inc`

2. `<meta property="og:type" content="website">`
   - Defines the type of content. In this case, `website` indicates a general webpage (other types include `article`, `video`, etc.).
   - **Value**: `website`

3. `<meta property="og:title" content="Safe Superintelligence Inc.">`
   - Sets the title displayed in the social media preview. This is typically the name of the page or organization.
   - **Value**: `Safe Superintelligence Inc.`

4. `<meta property="og:description" content="The world's first straight-shot SSI lab, with one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence.">`
   - Provides a brief description of the page’s content, shown in the preview. This summarizes the mission of Safe Superintelligence Inc.
   - **Value**: `The world's first straight-shot SSI lab, with one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence.`

5. `<meta property="og:image" content="https://ssi.inc/public/og-preview.jpg">`
   - Specifies the image to be displayed in the preview. This is typically a logo, banner, or relevant graphic.
   - **Value**: `https://ssi.inc/public/og-preview.jpg`

#### Twitter Card Tags
1. `<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">`
   - Defines the type of Twitter Card. `summary_large_image` creates a preview with a large image, title, and description.
   - **Value**: `summary_large_image`

2. `<meta name="twitter:site" content="@ssi">`
   - Specifies the Twitter (X) handle associated with the website, linking to the organization’s official account.
   - **Value**: `@ssi`

3. `<meta property="twitter:domain" content="ssi.inc">`
   - Indicates the domain of the website being shared.
   - **Value**: `ssi.inc`

4. `<meta property="twitter:url" content="https://ssi.inc">`
   - Specifies the URL of the page being shared, similar to `og:url`.
   - **Value**: `https://ssi.inc`

5. `<meta name="twitter:title" content="Safe Superintelligence Inc.">`
   - Sets the title for the Twitter Card, matching the Open Graph title.
   - **Value**: `Safe Superintelligence Inc.`

6. `<meta name="twitter:description" content="The world's first straight-shot SSI lab, with one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence.">`
   - Provides the description for the Twitter Card, matching the Open Graph description.
   - **Value**: `The world's first straight-shot SSI lab, with one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence.`

7. `<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://ssi.inc/public/og-preview.jpg">`
   - Specifies the image for the Twitter Card, matching the Open Graph image.
   - **Value**: `https://ssi.inc/public/og-preview.jpg`

### How Do These Meta Tags Work?

1. **Purpose**:
   - When someone shares the URL `https://ssi.inc` on a platform like Facebook or Twitter (X), the platform’s web crawler (e.g., Facebook’s crawler or Twitter’s bot) reads these meta tags from the page’s HTML.
   - The crawler extracts the title, description, image, and other metadata to generate a rich preview card. For example:
     - On **Facebook**, the shared link will display a card with the title “Safe Superintelligence Inc.,” the description “The world's first straight-shot SSI lab…,” and the image at `https://ssi.inc/public/og-preview.jpg`.
     - On **Twitter (X)**, a similar card will appear with a large image, the same title, and description, along with the `@ssi` handle for attribution.

2. **Mechanism**:
   - **Crawling**: When a URL is shared, the social media platform sends a request to the website’s server to fetch the HTML and parse the meta tags.
   - **Rendering**: The platform uses the tag values to create a preview card. For instance, `summary_large_image` on Twitter ensures a prominent image with text below it.
   - **Caching**: Platforms may cache the metadata to reduce server load. If the tags are updated, platforms like Facebook offer tools (e.g., the Sharing Debugger) to refresh the cache.
   - **Validation**: Platforms may validate the image (e.g., ensuring it’s accessible and meets size requirements) and fall back to default text or images if tags are missing or invalid.

3. **Impact**:
   - These tags improve user engagement by making shared links more visually appealing and informative.
   - They ensure branding consistency by allowing the website owner to control the title, description, and image.
   - They can drive traffic to the website by providing a compelling preview.

### Why These Meta Tags Matter for SSI

The meta tags reflect SSI’s branding and mission:
- The consistent title and description (“Safe Superintelligence Inc.” and “The world's first straight-shot SSI lab…”) emphasize its singular focus on safe superintelligence, aligning with its public messaging.[](https://ssi.inc)
- The Twitter handle `@ssi` connects the website to its official X account, where updates like the company’s founding announcement were posted.
- The image (`og-preview.jpg`) is likely a branded graphic or logo, though its content is not publicly described. It ensures visual consistency when the website is shared.

These tags are critical for SSI, a stealth-mode startup with minimal public presence, as they help control its narrative on social media, especially given its high-profile founders and significant investor interest.

### Limitations and Notes
- **Lack of Public Details**: SSI’s website and public information are sparse, reflecting its early-stage and stealth status. The meta tags provide a glimpse into its branding but not its technical approach.[](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/safe-superintelligence)[](https://siliconangle.com/2025/02/17/ilya-sutskevers-safe-superintelligence-reportedly-raising-1b-30b-valuation/)
- **Speculative Nature**: Claims about SSI’s valuation and funding are based on reports, but exact details (e.g., product roadmap) remain undisclosed.[](https://siliconangle.com/2025/02/17/ilya-sutskevers-safe-superintelligence-reportedly-raising-1b-30b-valuation/)
- **X Posts as Sentiment**: Posts on X (e.g.,,) suggest excitement about SSI’s potential but are not factual evidence and may contain speculation.
