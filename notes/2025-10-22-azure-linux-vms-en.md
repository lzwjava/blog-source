Yes, Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) fully support running Linux operating systems. You can deploy a wide range of popular distributions directly from the Azure Marketplace or upload your own custom Linux images.

### Key Highlights:
- **Supported Distributions**: Azure endorses and supports major Linux flavors, including Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Debian, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), Oracle Linux, CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, and more. Over 100 Linux images are available out-of-the-box.
- **Deployment Options**: Use the Azure portal, CLI, PowerShell, or ARM templates to create Linux VMs. For example, you can quickly spin up an Ubuntu Server instance in minutes.
- **Features**: Linux VMs on Azure include full integration with Azure services like storage, networking, security, and monitoring. They also support tools like Azure Arc for hybrid management.
