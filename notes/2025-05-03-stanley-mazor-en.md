Stanley Mazor is an American electrical engineer and a pivotal figure in the development of the first commercial single-chip microprocessor, the Intel 4004. His contributions were fundamental in shaping the architecture and instruction set of this revolutionary invention, which laid the groundwork for the digital age.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1941, Mazor developed an early interest in computers. He studied mathematics and programming at San Francisco State University. His career in the semiconductor industry began at Fairchild Semiconductor, where he worked as a programmer and later a computer designer, contributing to the Symbol computer.

In 1969, Mazor joined Intel Corporation and became part of the small team tasked with developing a set of chips for a Japanese calculator company, Busicom. Working alongside Ted Hoff and later Federico Faggin, Mazor was instrumental in defining the architecture and instruction set for the chip that would become the Intel 4004. His expertise in software and computer architecture complemented the team's efforts to create a general-purpose central processing unit on a single chip.

The Intel 4004, released in 1971, was a groundbreaking achievement that demonstrated the feasibility of a commercially viable microprocessor. While initially designed for a calculator, its programmable nature opened up a vast array of possibilities for future applications.

Following his work on the 4004, Mazor also contributed to the development of the Intel 8008, another early microprocessor. He later transitioned into teaching, sharing his knowledge and experience at Intel's technical training group, Stanford University, and the University of Santa Clara, as well as in various international locations.

As a testament to his significant role in inventing the microprocessor, Stanley Mazor has received numerous accolades, including the Kyoto Prize and the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, sharing these honors with his fellow co-inventors. His work remains a cornerstone of modern computing technology.
