Here is a list of **impactful chemists** who have made significant contributions to the field of chemistry:

### 1. **Marie Curie (1867–1934)**
   - Pioneered research on **radioactivity**, becoming the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different sciences (Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911).
   - Her discoveries of **radium** and **polonium** were groundbreaking and have had lasting effects in medicine and nuclear science.

### 2. **Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907)**
   - Known for creating the **Periodic Table of Elements**, Mendeleev arranged the known elements by their atomic mass, which revealed periodic relationships in their properties.
   - His periodic table was pivotal in the development of modern chemistry.

### 3. **Robert Boyle (1627–1691)**
   - Often considered the "father of modern chemistry," Boyle is known for **Boyle’s Law**, which describes the relationship between the pressure and volume of gas.
   - He helped establish the scientific method in chemistry and advanced the study of chemical reactions and the nature of gases.

### 4. **Linus Pauling (1901–1994)**
   - A two-time Nobel laureate, Pauling received the **Nobel Prize in Chemistry** in 1954 for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances.
   - He also received the **Nobel Peace Prize** in 1962 for his activism against nuclear weapons testing.

### 5. **Gilbert N. Lewis (1875–1946)**
   - Famous for his **Lewis structures**, which help to visualize the bonding between atoms in molecules.
   - His work in **acid-base theory** and **valence bond theory** contributed significantly to the understanding of molecular structure.

### 6. **Marie-Anne Lavoisier (1758–1836)**
   - A key figure in the discovery of the role of oxygen in combustion and respiration, Marie-Anne Lavoisier contributed to the development of the law of **conservation of mass**.
   - She is also recognized for her contributions to **modern chemical nomenclature** and her work in documenting her husband Antoine Lavoisier’s experiments.

### 7. **Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794)**
   - Known as the "Father of Modern Chemistry," Lavoisier established the **law of conservation of mass** and helped develop the modern system of chemical nomenclature.
   - He is credited with discovering the role of oxygen in combustion and recognizing that air is a mixture of gases.

### 8. **John Dalton (1766–1844)**
   - Best known for his **atomic theory**, which proposed that all matter is composed of atoms and that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of these atoms.
   - Dalton also formulated the **Law of Partial Pressures** (Dalton's Law), which laid the foundation for modern chemistry.

### 9. **Rosalind Franklin (1920–1958)**
   - Played a critical role in the discovery of the **DNA double helix** structure through her X-ray crystallography work.
   - Her images, particularly **Photograph 51**, provided crucial information that helped Watson and Crick determine the structure of DNA.

### 10. **Marie-Sklodowska Curie (1867–1934)**
   - A pioneering researcher in **radioactivity**, Curie’s discoveries of **radium** and **polonium** have had lasting effects on the fields of chemistry and medicine.
   - She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and remains a major figure in science history.

### 11. **Alfred Werner (1866–1919)**
   - Known for his work in **coordination chemistry**, Werner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1913 for his work on the structure of complex compounds.
   - His theory of **coordination bonds** was instrumental in the development of modern inorganic chemistry.

### 12. **Friedrich Wöhler (1800–1882)**
   - Often regarded as the father of **organic chemistry**, Wöhler is famous for his synthesis of **urea** from ammonium cyanate, disproving the theory of vitalism and demonstrating that organic compounds could be synthesized from inorganic substances.

### 13. **Richard Feynman (1918–1988)**
   - A physicist whose work on quantum mechanics contributed significantly to chemistry, Feynman developed the **Feynman diagrams**, which visualize interactions between particles.
   - He played a key role in the development of quantum electrodynamics and the understanding of chemical reactions at the atomic level.

### 14. **Sir Humphry Davy (1778–1829)**
   - Known for the discovery of several chemical elements, including **sodium**, **potassium**, and **calcium**, Davy also invented the **Davy lamp**, which was crucial for miners’ safety.
   - His work in electrochemistry led to the development of the **electrochemical series**.

### 15. **Rudolf Clausius (1822–1888)**
   - A physicist and chemist, Clausius contributed to the formulation of the **second law of thermodynamics** and helped develop the concept of **entropy**, which describes the disorder of a system.

### 16. **Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937)**
   - Known for his work in nuclear chemistry, Rutherford discovered the structure of the atom by performing the **gold foil experiment** and identifying the atomic nucleus.
   - He also discovered **radon** and contributed significantly to the field of **radioactivity**.

### 17. **Joseph Priestley (1733–1804)**
   - Discovered **oxygen** (which he called "dephlogisticated air") and contributed to the development of the theory of gases.
   - He also discovered several gases, including **nitrous oxide** and **ammonia**.

### 18. **Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin (1910–1994)**
   - A Nobel laureate in Chemistry (1964), Hodgkin was known for her work using X-ray crystallography to determine the structures of important biochemical substances, including **penicillin** and **vitamin B12**.

### 19. **Lavoisier's Collaborators (e.g., Antoine Lavoisier)**
   - His contributions to **chemical nomenclature** and his systematic approach to chemical reactions and experiments greatly influenced how chemistry was practiced during his time.

### 20. **Henry Cavendish (1731–1810)**
   - Known for discovering **hydrogen** and his work in **gas chemistry**.
   - He also conducted experiments that led to the understanding of **specific gravity** and helped develop the theory of the **chemical composition of water**.

These chemists have greatly advanced our understanding of chemistry, contributing to areas such as atomic theory, molecular biology, thermodynamics, and inorganic chemistry. Their groundbreaking work continues to shape modern science and technology.
