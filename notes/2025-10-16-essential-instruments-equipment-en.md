- **Ukulele**: Compact and beginner-friendly, great for casual strumming and Hawaiian-style tunes.

#### Percussion and Drums
- **Drums/Drum Kit**: Essential for rhythm in bands and electronic production; includes bass drum, snare, and cymbals for dynamic beats.

#### Wind Instruments
- **Flute**: Lightweight woodwind that's melodic and great for beginners in classical or jazz.
- **Saxophone**: Soulful brass/woodwind hybrid, a favorite in jazz and blues.
