### Jeong Eui-sun: Executive Chairman of Hyundai Motor Group

Jeong Eui-sun (정의선; born October 18, 1970), also known in English as Euisun Chung, is a South Korean billionaire business magnate and the third-generation leader of the Hyundai Motor Group, the world's third-largest automaker by volume. As Executive Chairman and CEO of the group since 2020, he oversees a sprawling conglomerate that includes Hyundai Motor Company, Kia Corporation, Genesis (its luxury brand), and affiliates in steel, construction, finance, and emerging mobility sectors. With a net worth estimated at $3.3 billion as of late 2024—making him South Korea's 10th-richest person—Chung has steered Hyundai toward global innovation, emphasizing electrification, hydrogen technology, and sustainable mobility. His leadership has transformed the once-quality-challenged Korean brands into premium players, earning him recognition as a visionary in the automotive industry.

#### Early Life and Education
Born in Seoul, South Korea, Chung grew up in the shadow of one of the nation's most influential industrial dynasties. He is the only son of Chung Mong-koo, the honorary chairman of Hyundai Motor Group and a key figure in its post-founder expansion, and the late Lee Jung-hwa. The Chung family traces its roots to Chung Ju-yung, the legendary founder of the Hyundai Group in 1947, who built an empire from a single auto repair shop into a chaebol (family-controlled conglomerate) spanning shipbuilding, construction, and automobiles. As the eldest among his siblings (three sisters and one younger brother in the broader family context), Euisun was groomed early for leadership, immersed in a legacy of resilience and ambition.

Chung attended Whimoon High School in Seoul before pursuing higher education abroad and domestically. He earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from Korea University in 1993, followed by a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the University of San Francisco in 1997. These experiences equipped him with a blend of Eastern and Western business perspectives, which he later applied to Hyundai's international strategies.

#### Family and Personal Life
Married to Chung Ji-seon—the daughter of Chung Do-won, founder of the Sampyo Group—Euisun has two children: a daughter, Seon A-yeong (born 1987), and a son, Seon Tong-uk (born 1989). The family resides in Seoul and maintains a low public profile, in line with the Chung clan's tradition of blending immense wealth with discretion. The broader Hyundai family tree is complex, with generational naming conventions (e.g., those ending in "-yung" for the founder’s era, "Mong-" for the second generation, and "-seon" for the third) reflecting intricate cross-affiliations across Hyundai entities. Euisun's role as the "heir apparent" solidified the patriarchal succession, ensuring continuity in the group's direction.

#### Career Progression
Chung's professional journey began in 1994 as a deputy manager at Hyundai Precision and Industries Ltd. in San Francisco, giving him hands-on exposure to global operations. From 1997 to 1999, he worked at Itochu Corporation in New York, honing skills in international trade and procurement. Returning to Korea in 1999, he joined Hyundai's Procurement Planning & Coordination Group as director, then advanced through operational roles in IT, sales, marketing, after-sales service, and corporate planning between 2000 and 2005.

A pivotal moment came in 2005 when, at age 35, he was appointed president of Kia Motors—the group's majority-owned subsidiary (Hyundai holds about 34% stake). Over the next four years, he revitalized Kia by championing "design-oriented management," infusing creativity and vitality into product development. This era produced breakout successes like the Kia Cee'd (which won European Car of the Year in 2007), Soul, and Forte, elevating Kia's image from budget-friendly to stylish and competitive.

In 2009, amid the fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis, Chung ascended to vice chairman of Hyundai Motor Group, where he navigated economic turbulence while fostering cross-sector harmony among automotive, parts, steel, construction, and finance units. By 2018, he became executive vice chairman, and in October 2020, he succeeded his father as executive chairman and CEO. This transition marked the full handover of the Hyundai legacy, with Mong-koo stepping into an honorary role.

#### Key Achievements and Business Strategies
Under Chung's stewardship, Hyundai Motor Group has evolved from a traditional carmaker into a "mobility solutions enterprise." He has accelerated investments in electrification (with models like the Ioniq 5 and EV6), autonomous driving, connectivity, urban air mobility (UAM), robotics, purpose-built vehicles (PBV), and smart cities—aiming to redefine transportation for a decarbonized future. In 2015, he spearheaded the launch of the Genesis luxury brand and the high-performance N sub-brand, showcasing Hyundai's technological prowess and closing the gap with luxury rivals like BMW and Mercedes.

A cornerstone of his vision is hydrogen technology. As co-chair of the Hydrogen Council since 2019, Chung unveiled Hyundai's Hydrogen Vision 2040 in 2021, committing to innovations across the hydrogen value chain—from production to fuel cells—to build a global "hydrogen society." This aligns with his philosophy of placing "humanity’s well-being" at the core of tech advancements, with customers driving all decisions. He promotes an open innovation model, collaborating with startups and global partners, while fostering a corporate culture of communication, autonomy, and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) principles.

Chung's sports involvement adds another dimension: He has served as president of World Archery Asia since 2005, currently in his fifth term, blending personal passion with brand ambassadorship.

#### Philanthropy and Social Impact
Chung extends Hyundai's influence through the "MOVE" initiative, a global social contribution program launched under his leadership. It emphasizes sustainable practices, environmental protection, societal benefits, and strong governance, supporting communities worldwide via education, health, and eco-friendly projects. This reflects his commitment to harmonizing business growth with broader societal progress.

#### Recent Developments
As of 2025, Chung's impact continues to resonate. In August 2025, he and the entire founding Chung family received the Automotive News Centennial Award, honoring their century-long contributions to the industry—from Hyundai's 1947 origins to its current status as a top global automaker. This accolade underscores how Chung has not only preserved but elevated the family legacy, positioning Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis among the world's elite brands and solidifying South Korea's automotive dominance. With the group reporting record sales and expanding into AI-driven mobility, Chung remains at the forefront of the EV and hydrogen revolutions, navigating challenges like supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions.

In essence, Jeong Eui-sun embodies the Hyundai ethos of bold innovation and enduring legacy, steering a $150 billion empire toward a future where mobility serves humanity's greater good.
