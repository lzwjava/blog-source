### Syncing Video Speed to Music Rhythm in CapCut

Yes, CapCut allows you to adjust video speed (faster or slower) to create rhythmic effects that sync perfectly with music beats, such as speeding up during high-energy sections and slowing down for dramatic pauses. This is often done using speed ramping (or "velocity" effects) combined with auto-beat detection for precise timing. CapCut's built-in tools make it straightforward, especially with its AI-assisted features for automatic syncing.

## Key Features for Rhythm Matching
CapCut offers:
- **Auto-Beat Detection**: Automatically marks music beats with visual markers, helping you align video cuts or speed changes.
- **Speed Adjustment**: Basic uniform speed changes (e.g., 2x fast or 0.5x slow) or curve-based ramping for smooth transitions between speeds.
- **Velocity Effects**: Advanced tool for dynamic speed variations that follow audio waveforms, ideal for rhythmic syncing like in music videos or TikToks.
These work on both mobile and PC versions of CapCut.[1][2]

## Step-by-Step Guide to Perfect Sync
Follow these steps to import your video, add music, detect beats, and apply speed changes for a flawless match. This process uses CapCut's free features.

1. **Start a New Project and Import Media**:
   - Open CapCut and create a new project.
   - Import your video clip(s) via the "+" button or gallery.
   - Add your music: Tap the "Audio" tab, select "Sounds" or import a track from your device. Drag it to the timeline below your video track.[3][4]

2. **Enable Auto-Beat Detection**:
   - Select the audio track in the timeline.
   - Tap or right-click it, then choose "Beat" or "Extract Beat."
   - Toggle on "Auto Generate" – this will place yellow dots or markers on the beats across the timeline.
   - These markers help visualize the rhythm; you can adjust their sensitivity if needed for a stronger/weaker beat emphasis.[5][6]

3. **Apply Basic Speed Changes to Match Beats**:
   - Select your video clip in the timeline.
   - Go to the "Speed" tab (or "Edit" > "Speed" on PC).
   - Use the slider to set overall speed (e.g., 1.5x for faster sections to hit quick beats, or 0.25x for slow-motion on downbeats).
   - For rhythm-specific adjustments: Split the clip at beat markers (tap the scissor icon at a marker), then apply different speeds to each segment. This creates a "stutter" or rhythmic flow.[7][8]

4. **Use Speed Ramping (Velocity) for Smooth, Perfect Sync**:
   - For pro-level matching where speed ramps up/down fluidly with the music (e.g., accelerating to a drop):
     - Select the video clip, then tap "Speed" > "Curve" or "Velocity" (on PC, it's under "Animation" > "Speed Curve").
     - CapCut will show a graph; drag keyframes at beat markers to create ramps (e.g., slow at verse start, ramp to fast at chorus).
     - Sync to audio: Enable "Link to Audio" or use the waveform view to align keyframes with beat peaks for automatic suggestions.
     - Preview and fine-tune – play the timeline to ensure the video "dances" with the music.[2][1]
   - Tip: For automatic syncing, select both video and audio tracks, then use "Auto Sync" under the audio menu. CapCut's AI analyzes and adjusts timings/speeds to match beats.[4]

5. **Refine and Export**:
   - Add transitions or effects at speed changes (e.g., freeze frame on a beat via "Speed" > "Freeze").
   - Preview the full edit with music to check rhythm – zoom into the timeline for pixel-perfect alignment.
   - Export in your desired resolution (e.g., 1080p for social media).

## Tips for a Perfect Match
- **Practice with Short Clips**: Start with 10-15 second segments to test speeds against beats before scaling up.
- **Manual Tweaks**: If auto-beat misses subtle rhythms, manually add markers (tap "+" on the audio track at key points).
- **Common Issues**: Mismatched sample rates can cause drift – ensure your music is high-quality (e.g., 44.1kHz). For complex rhythms, layer multiple clips with varying speeds.
- **Advanced**: Combine with keyframes for effects like zoom or pan that also sync to beats, creating a more dynamic video.[6][7]

This method can achieve near-professional results, like those in viral TikToks or music edits. For visual demos, check tutorials on YouTube (e.g., search for "CapCut velocity sync tutorial"). If you're on mobile vs. PC, steps are similar but interfaces differ slightly.[2][3]
