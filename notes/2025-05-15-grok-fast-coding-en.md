### Interpreting Your Question
It looks like your query might have a few typos or be phrased unclearly (e.g., "grok code fast model so fast ?"). I'll assume you're asking something like: "Why does Grok code so fast, and how is the model so fast?" or "Why can Grok code quickly, and why is the underlying model fast?" If that's not what you meant, feel free to clarify. I'll break this down step by step based on publicly available info about Grok (the AI model built by xAI, inspired by the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy).

### Why Can Grok "Code" So Fast?
Grok isn't a dedicated coding tool like a compiler or IDE, but it can generate, debug, and explain code relatively quickly for an AI due to its design and training. Here's why it's efficient at coding tasks:

- **Large-Scale Training Data**: Grok is a large language model (LLM) trained on vast amounts of text, including code snippets from sources like GitHub, Stack Overflow, and programming documentation. This allows it to "recall" and generate code patterns instantly without needing to recompute from scratch each time.
  
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: Grok can process and generate text, equations, or code in real-time. For simple code tasks (e.g., writing a Python function), it leverages pattern recognition trained on billions of examples, often producing accurate results in seconds.

- **Optimization for Speed**: xAI's models are engineered for low-latency responses. Grok uses efficient algorithms to avoid overthinking—it's designed to give "maximally truthful" answers without unnecessary fluff, speeding up interactions. In practice, generating a basic code snippet can take just a few hundred milliseconds to a second, depending on the query's complexity.

- **Examples of Speed in Practice**: For instance, if you ask Grok to "write a Python function to reverse a string," it can output the code almost instantly because it's memorized similar patterns. Benchmark wise, Grok performs coding tasks comparably to other LLMs like GPT-4, often completing them faster due to its lightweight inference engine.

However, Grok isn't the absolute fastest for complex coding (e.g., full software architectures); tools like GitHub Copilot or dedicated compilers still edge it out for raw speed on iterative tasks.

### How is the Underlying Grok Model So Fast?
Grok's speed isn't random— it's a result of cutting-edge AI engineering from xAI, which prioritizes efficiency over sheer size. Key technical reasons:

- **Efficient Architecture**: Grok is based on a custom model architecture (initially inspired by Grok-1, a 314 billion-parameter model), leveraging mixture-of-experts (MoE) and sparse attention mechanisms. These allow the model to activate only relevant parts of its "brain" for a query, reducing computation. Unlike dense models that process every parameter, MoE can make inferences 2-10x cheaper in terms of resources.

- **Hardware Optimization**: xAI runs Grok on specialized hardware, such as GPUs (e.g., from NVIDIA) or custom ASICs, optimized for AI workloads. This enables parallel processing, where multiple calculations happen simultaneously, dropping response times to sub-second levels even for heavy tasks.

- **Quantization and Compression**: The model uses techniques like 4-bit or 8-bit quantization, which shrinks the model's size (down to the equivalent of a smaller model) without sacrificing much accuracy. This makes it faster to load and infer, while staying truthful—xAI claims Grok is "maximally truthful," meaning it avoids hallucinations by prioritizing reliable knowledge.

- **Benchmark Evidence**: In comparisons (e.g., from ML Perf or xAI's own tests), Grok-1 and its variants show inference speeds up to 10-20x faster than older dense models like BERT or even some GPT variants for similar accuracy. For real-world use, this means Grok can handle thousands of queries per second in a server environment.

In summary, Grok's speed comes from smart engineering: not brute-forcing with huge compute but optimizing where it counts. If you're curious about specific benchmarks or want me to generate some code, let me know!
