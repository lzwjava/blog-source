title: Python Diagram-as-Code Tool Alternatives

Here are Python-friendly options (beyond Graphviz and NetworkX) that make generating software design/architecture diagrams straightforward. I grouped them by use case and included quick notes and tiny examples.

Diagram-as-code (UML, C4, flowcharts, sequences)
- PlantUML (via python-plantuml or local JAR)
  - Great for UML: class, sequence, component, state, activity, deployment.
  - Works well in CI and with docs.
  - Example:
    @startuml
    class User
    class Order
    User "1" --> "*" Order
    @enduml
- Mermaid (use CLI or a Kroki server; Python can call renderer)
  - Simple syntax for sequence, class, flowchart, ER, state, etc.
  - Renders nicely in many doc tools and wikis.
  - Example:
    flowchart LR
      API --> DB
- BlockDiag family (blockdiag, seqdiag, actdiag, nwdiag)
  - Pure-Python tools to generate block, sequence, activity, and network diagrams from simple text.
  - Example (seqdiag):
    seqdiag {
      Client -> API [label = "GET /users"];
      API -> DB [label = "query"];
    }
- Structurizr (C4 model; community Python client)
  - Model software architecture (Context, Container, Component) and render via Structurizr/PlantUML.
  - Strong for multi-view architecture docs and ADR workflows.
- Kroki (diagram-as-a-service; Python client available)
  - Render many DSLs (PlantUML, Mermaid, Graphviz, BPMN, etc.) via a single HTTP API from Python.

Cloud and infrastructure architecture
- Diagrams (by mingrammer)
  - Diagram-as-code for cloud/system architecture with official provider icons (AWS, Azure, GCP, K8s, on-prem).
  - Very popular for architecture overviews.
  - Example:
    from diagrams import Diagram
    from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2
    from diagrams.aws.database import RDS
    with Diagram("Web Service", show=False):
        EC2("api") >> RDS("db")

Interactive network/graph visualizations (handy for system maps, dependencies)
- PyVis (vis.js)
  - Minimal code to produce interactive HTML graphs.
  - Example:
    from pyvis.network import Network
    net = Network(); net.add_nodes(["API","DB"]); net.add_edge("API","DB"); net.show("arch.html")
- Dash Cytoscape / ipycytoscape (Cytoscape.js)
  - For interactive, customizable graphs in Dash apps or Jupyter. Good for exploring dependencies and flows.
- Plotly
  - Build interactive node-link diagrams with custom styling; easy to embed/share.
- Bokeh / HoloViews
  - Interactive plotting with network support; good for Python-centric dashboards.
- python-igraph
  - Fast graph library with built-in plotting; suitable when you need layout algorithms plus exportable diagrams.

Documentation integrations (keep diagrams close to your docs)
- Sphinx extensions: sphinxcontrib-plantuml, sphinxcontrib-mermaid, sphinxcontrib-blockdiag
  - Write diagrams inline in reStructuredText/Markdown and build them in your docs pipeline.
- MkDocs plugins (for Mermaid/PlantUML)
  - Convenient for modern static sites.

Code and architecture reverse-engineering
- pylint’s pyreverse
  - Generates UML class and package diagrams from Python code (often renders via Graphviz, but workflow is simple).
- pydeps
  - Creates import/dependency graphs of Python packages, handy for architecture maps in large codebases.

Specialized diagrams
- SchemDraw
  - Programmatic circuit/logic/flowchart diagrams in Python; clean vector output.
- railroad-diagrams
  - Generate syntax/grammar diagrams (useful for protocol/spec documentation).

Tips to choose
- Quick UML/sequence docs: PlantUML or Mermaid.
- Cloud/system architecture posters: Diagrams (mingrammer).
- Interactive exploration and sharing: PyVis or Dash Cytoscape.
- C4 model and living architecture docs: Structurizr (with PlantUML/Mermaid via export).
- Auto-diagrams from code: pyreverse, pydeps.

If you tell me your target diagram types (UML class, sequence, C4, cloud, data flow, package deps) and output format (PNG/SVG/HTML/embedded in docs), I can suggest a minimal setup and a starter template.
