### Activating Daily Data Plans on China Telecom Easy+ Prepaid Card (Macau)

The China Telecom Easy+ prepaid SIM card (also known as the China Macau Telecom SIM) supports affordable daily data add-ons for use in Macau, Mainland China, Hong Kong, and sometimes extended roaming. These are activated via SMS commands sent to the short code **1888**. The card provides a local Macau phone number (+853) and is designed for travelers, with automatic activation upon insertion (ensure your phone is unlocked and compatible with China Telecom's network, typically 4G/LTE).

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Activate Daily Plans
1. **Insert the SIM**: Power on your phone with the SIM inserted. It should connect to the China Telecom Macau network automatically. If not, manually select "China Telecom" in your phone's network settings.
2. **Check Balance and Validity**: Dial *122# or #321# (press call/send) to view your remaining balance, expiry date, and active bonuses. The card typically starts with a face value (e.g., MOP 100) and 180-day validity, extendable via top-up.
3. **Activate a Daily Data Plan**:
   - For the **2 MOP/day plan** (basic daily data allowance, suitable for light use like messaging and browsing):
     - Send an SMS with the exact text **602** to **1888**.
     - Deduction: 2 MOP from your balance. Valid for 24 hours from activation.
   - For the **3 MOP/day plan** (enhanced daily data, better for moderate streaming or navigation):
     - Send an SMS with the exact text **903** to **1888**.
     - Deduction: 3 MOP from your balance. Valid for 24 hours from activation.
   
   You'll receive a confirmation SMS from 1888 once activated. Data usage is shared across Macau, Mainland China, and Hong Kong (roaming partners: CTM in Macau, China Mobile/Unicom in Mainland, CSL in HK). Speed may throttle after high usage (e.g., after 1-2 GB).

4. **Top-Up Balance**: If low on credit, top up via vending machines, CTM shops, or apps like CTM Buddy. Minimum top-up is usually MOP 10-50, which extends validity by 180 days.

#### Changing or Switching Daily Plans (Using 3025)
To switch between the 2 MOP and 3 MOP plans (or cancel the current one):
- First, **deactivate the existing plan**: Send SMS with the text **XDATA** to **1888** to stop the current daily data package. This prevents overlapping charges. Remaining data (if any) is not refunded but can be used until expiry.
- Then, activate the new plan using the steps above (602 for 2 MOP or 903 for 3 MOP).
- Note on **3025**: Based on available documentation, this appears to be a legacy or specific code for plan management in some China Telecom Macau setups, potentially for querying/changing plan options via USSD (dial **3025#** and follow prompts to select 2 MOP or 3 MOP). If it doesn't work, contact customer service by dialing 1888 (free from the SIM) or 10000 (China Telecom hotline). Alternatively, use the CTM Buddy app for self-service plan changes.

#### Additional Tips
- **Voice and SMS Rates**: Local calls/SMS in Macau: ~0.40 MOP/min and 0.25 MOP/SMS. Incoming SMS free. For Mainland China/HK calls, prefix with 050 for discounted IDD rates (0.70 MOP/min off-peak).
- **Data Deactivation**: Always send "XDATA" to 1888 if you want to turn off roaming data to avoid accidental charges.
- **Compatibility**: Works on most unlocked GSM/4G phones. Enable data roaming in settings.
- **Expiry**: Plans auto-renew daily if balance sufficient; monitor via *122#.
- If issues arise, visit a CTM store in Macau or dial 1888 for support (Mandarin/Cantonese/English available).

This setup keeps costs low for short trips—e.g., 2 MOP/day for essentials.
