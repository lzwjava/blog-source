Closing all curtains in a bedroom has minimal impact on 4G, 5G, or mobile signals like China Telecom. Mobile signals primarily rely on radio waves, which are affected by physical obstructions like walls, metal, or thick concrete, not lightweight materials like curtains. Curtains, even heavy ones, are generally too thin and porous to significantly block or weaken these signals.

However, if the curtains are lined with metal-backed materials (e.g., blackout curtains with metallic coatings) or the room is already in a weak signal area, there could be a slight reduction in signal strength. For instance:

- **4G/5G Signals**: These operate at frequencies (e.g., 700 MHz to 3.5 GHz for 4G, up to 28 GHz for 5G mmWave) that can penetrate most household materials, but higher-frequency 5G mmWave signals are more susceptible to obstructions. Curtains alone are unlikely to cause noticeable disruption unless combined with other factors like thick walls or being far from a cell tower.
- **China Telecom**: As a major carrier, it uses similar frequency bands (e.g., 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz for 4G, and 3.5 GHz for 5G). The same principles apply—curtains won’t significantly degrade the signal.

If you’re experiencing poor signal, consider:
- **Location**: Proximity to a cell tower or being in a basement/urban area with many obstructions.
- **Building Materials**: Concrete, metal, or tinted windows can block signals more than curtains.
- **Device Position**: Try moving closer to a window or higher elevation in the room.

To confirm, you could test signal strength (e.g., using your phone’s signal bars or dBm readings) with curtains open vs. closed. If you need real-time data or suspect specific issues with China Telecom’s network, I can search for relevant information or analyze related posts on X. Let me know!
