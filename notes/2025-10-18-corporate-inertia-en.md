You're spot on—that inertia in big companies and banks often boils down to the sheer friction of change in a high-stakes, regulated environment. Let me unpack your point a bit and add some layers to it, because it's a classic trap that keeps incumbents playing defense while nimbler players lap them.

### The Consensus Bottleneck
In massive organizations, decisions don't just need sign-off from a boss—they require alignment across layers of middle managers, compliance teams, legal, and sometimes even external regulators. Getting buy-in for something novel (like adopting AI for fraud detection or blockchain for settlements) means endless meetings, RFPs, and pilots that drag on for months. Your point about studying new things hits hard: employees aren't paid to experiment; they're rewarded for shipping reliable quarterly results. Why risk a "learning curve" that could spike errors or delay deadlines when the status quo keeps the lights on?

### The 9-to-5 Overload
Daily ops eat up bandwidth—think patching legacy systems from the '90s, handling compliance audits, or just responding to the flood of routine transactions. There's no built-in "innovation time" like Google famously tried with 20% time (which even they scaled back). Learning a new tool? That could mean after-hours YouTube tutorials or weekend cramming, all while juggling family, burnout, and that elusive work-life balance. Effort compounds: not only does it take more cognitive load upfront, but integrating it into workflows often uncovers hidden dependencies (e.g., "Wait, our COBOL mainframe doesn't play nice with this cloud API").

### Why This Hits Banks Extra Hard
Banks are wired for stability over speed—think Sarbanes-Oxley, Basel III, or endless KYC checks. A single misstep can mean fines in the billions, so "move fast and break things" is heresy. Contrast that with fintech startups: they launch MVPs in weeks because a team of 50 can pivot without a 500-person org chart. Big players know this; that's why they acquire startups (e.g., JPMorgan buying WePay) rather than build in-house. But even acquisitions often get bogged down in "integration hell."

### Quick Fixes? Easier Said Than Done
- **Dedicated "skunkworks" teams**: Isolate innovators from the bureaucracy (like Bell Labs did for transistors).
- **Upskilling incentives**: Tie bonuses to learning milestones, not just output.
- **Cultural shifts**: Flatten hierarchies or use zero-based budgeting to force fresh thinking.

If this resonates with a specific company or trend you're seeing (like banks lagging on crypto regs), what's the context? I'd love to dive deeper.
