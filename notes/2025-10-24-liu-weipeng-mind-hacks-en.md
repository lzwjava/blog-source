### Overview of mindhacks.cn
The website http://mindhacks.cn is the personal blog of Liu Weipeng (刘未鹏), a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft with over 15 years of experience in C++ systems engineering and backend services. Liu is also known for translating technical books like *Imperfect C++*, *Exceptional C++ Style*, and *Working Effectively with Legacy Code*. His blog primarily covers topics in programming, effective learning strategies, psychology, cognitive science, and productivity—often blending technical insights with practical advice on how the mind works.

The site serves as a platform for Liu's essays and articles, which he began publishing in 2003 via CSDN (a Chinese developer community) before consolidating them here. It's written in Chinese and features in-depth, reflective posts rather than short updates, emphasizing "mind hacks" for better thinking and problem-solving.

### Connection to "Dark Time"
Liu's book *Dark Time* (《暗时间》), published around 2012, is a compilation of selected articles from his blog spanning eight years. The title refers to the "hidden" or underutilized time in daily life—those unstructured moments where deep thinking and learning can occur. The book expands on themes from mindhacks.cn, such as time management, learning efficiency, and psychological insights for programmers and knowledge workers. It's praised for its thoughtful, non-prescriptive approach to personal growth.

If you're looking for specific articles, the blog archives older posts on similar themes, though the site may require a Chinese browser or translation tool for full access.
