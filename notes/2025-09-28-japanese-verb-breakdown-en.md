Let me break down **呼んでいる (yondeiru)** character by character and explain the grammatical structure:

## The Verb: 呼ぶ (yobu)

**呼** (yo) - This kanji means "to call" or "summon"
**ぶ** (bu) - This is the verb ending

### Why "yobu" and not "buyo"?
In Japanese, the **root/stem comes first, then the inflection**. This is the standard word order:
- **呼** (yo) = the semantic root meaning "call"
- **ぶ** (bu) = the verb ending that makes it "to call"

Reversing it to "buyo" would be grammatically impossible in Japanese - it would be like trying to say "to-call" instead of "call-to" in English.

## The Te-form: 呼んで (yonde)

When 呼ぶ becomes 呼んで, this follows the **te-form conjugation rule** for verbs ending in -bu:
- Verbs ending in -bu, -mu, -nu → change to -nde
- 呼ぶ → 呼んで (yobu → yonde)

**ん** (n) - This is the phonetic change that occurs
**で** (de) - This is the te-form ending

## The Progressive Form: ている (teiru)

**て** (te) - The te-form connector
**い** (i) - Part of the auxiliary verb いる
**る** (ru) - Completes the auxiliary verb いる (iru, "to exist/be")

### Why "teiru" and not "teriu"?
Japanese syllable structure is very strict. The auxiliary verb is **いる (iru)**, not **いうr**. The order i-ru follows Japanese phonetic patterns:
- **い (i)** - vowel sound
- **る (ru)** - consonant + vowel sound

## Complete Structure:
**呼んでいる** = 呼ん (yon, modified stem) + で (de, te-form) + いる (iru, "to be/exist")

This creates the meaning: "is calling" or "is in the state of calling" - indicating an ongoing action happening right now.

The character order reflects Japanese grammar where auxiliary verbs follow main verbs, and inflections are added systematically according to phonetic rules.
