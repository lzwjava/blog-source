### Overview
Waabi AI Corp is a Toronto-based artificial intelligence company focused on developing autonomous driving technology, primarily for long-haul trucking. Founded in 2021 by AI pioneer Raquel Urtasun (former Uber ATG chief scientist), it aims to revolutionize the trucking industry by creating safer, more efficient self-driving vehicles at scale. With 51-200 employees, Waabi emphasizes "Physical AI"—AI systems that interact with the physical world—starting with trucks to address supply chain challenges like driver shortages.

### Mission and Technology
Waabi's core innovation is an end-to-end interpretable and verifiable AI model that learns directly from data, combined with a high-fidelity neural simulator called Waabi World. This simulator generates realistic driving scenarios (e.g., accidents or unpredictable road events) for training without relying solely on real-world miles, reducing costs and risks. Their generative AI approach, including the Copilot4D model, enables trucks to handle complex, rare situations more effectively than traditional rule-based systems.

### Products
- **Waabi Driver**: An autonomous trucking system that's been tested on public roads since 2023. It's designed for fully driverless operations, with plans to deploy commercial fleets in 2025.
- **Waabi World**: A simulation platform that complements real-world testing, allowing for millions of virtual miles to refine AI models.

### Recent Developments
In June 2024, Waabi raised $200 million in Series B funding to accelerate driverless truck launches. They opened a purpose-built autonomous vehicle terminal in Lancaster, Texas, in 2025 to support operations. Partnerships with NVIDIA and others bolster their generative AI capabilities.
