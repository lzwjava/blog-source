People in large financial institutions often tilt toward caution, and the reasons you named are part of the picture, but the full dynamic is even broader. You can think of it as a combination of structural incentives, career psychology, and organizational physics.

Here’s a clear, narrative explanation without wide-format structures:

**1. The consequences of failure are disproportionate.**
In a major bank, a single outage can halt payments, break compliance rules, and even trigger regulatory scrutiny. Even if the root cause is small, the fallout is huge. This naturally drives people to be conservative. When the cost of one mistake is far higher than the reward of one innovation, people choose protection.

**2. The evaluation system punishes mistakes more than it rewards initiative.**
In hierarchical organizations, your performance is judged by your manager, and your manager’s manager, not by the market. Since managers remember problems more vividly than successes, employees optimize for invisibility and stability. It’s safer to stay in the middle of the pack than to stand out and draw attention.

**3. Bureaucracy creates distance from the customer.**
This alters behavior. When the person doing the work doesn’t feel the win from a customer’s happiness but absolutely feels the pain from messing up, their internal equation shifts toward risk-aversion.

**4. The promotion ladder selects for political skill, not builder instinct.**
Over time, those who rise tend to be good at navigating complexity, smoothing conflicts, and avoiding blame. These are useful skills in a large institution. But they differ from the traits you see in founders: rapid decision-making, willingness to break things, hunger for results.
This means senior leadership often prefers stability and predictability over taking big swings.

**5. Higher-level managers want peace, not trouble.**
They manage many teams and initiatives at once. Any crisis consumes their time, exposes them to scrutiny from above, interrupts their comfortable state, and potentially hurts their long-term compensation. This makes them encourage policies that reduce variance: more reviews, more processes, fewer surprises.

**6. Contractors worsen the dynamic.**
In places like big banks, contractors don’t usually get long-term career upside. Their safe move is to follow rules, not challenge them. This reinforces a culture that values compliance over creativity. And managers who supervise large groups of contractors become even more cautious because they don’t fully trust the variable skill levels.

**7. There is no ownership mindset.**
Startups tie personal identity, wealth, and impact directly to outcomes. Banks do not. In that environment, people choose the safest path that preserves their paycheck and reputation.

**8. Regulation amplifies everything above.**
Financial institutions must report incidents, pass audits, and meet strict compliance requirements. This creates a worldview where innovation looks dangerous and maintaining the status quo seems heroic.

So yes, the pattern you described is correct:
– large blast radius → fear of errors
– layers of hierarchy → focus on pleasing bosses
– bureaucratic culture → risk is punished
– upper management comfort → preference for low-friction operation

All these gradually transform people from builder mode into caretaker mode.

If you want, I can also explain why this pattern is extremely hard to reverse internally and why AI-era small teams are putting pressure on these institutions.
