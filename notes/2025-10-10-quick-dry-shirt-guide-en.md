### Quick-Dry Shirts: English Terms for "Sugan" (速干衫)

Based on your description, "sugan" (or "sù gān shān" in pinyin) refers to **速干衫** in Chinese, which translates directly to **quick-dry shirt** or **fast-dry shirt**. These are lightweight, moisture-wicking tops designed for quick evaporation of sweat, breathability, and comfort—perfect for sports, outdoor activities, or hot weather. They're often made from synthetic fabrics like polyester blends with tech features for drying faster than cotton.

This matches products like:
- **Uniqlo's AIRism**: Their signature line of quick-drying, anti-odor shirts (available in long-sleeve versions for men).
- **JD.com's Jingzao (京造)**: JD's in-house brand for affordable "100 Cool Quick-Dry" shirts, emphasizing fast-drying cotton-poly blends for running, fitness, or casual wear.

#### Common English Ways to Describe Them
- **Quick-dry shirt**: The most straightforward term—highlights the fast-drying feature.
- **Fast-dry T-shirt** (or long-sleeve top): Emphasizes speed of drying, like you mentioned.
- **Moisture-wicking shirt**: Focuses on sweat absorption and evaporation (e.g., "athletic moisture-wicking long-sleeve").
- **Performance shirt**: Broader term for sporty, tech-fabric tops that are breathable and quick-drying.
- **Dri-FIT shirt** (Nike-style) or **AIRism shirt** (Uniqlo-specific): Branded versions.

If you're shopping in English, search for "men's quick-dry long-sleeve shirt" on sites like Amazon or Uniqlo's global store. For that shiny green vibe from our last chat, look for ones with a subtle sheen from spandex blends.
