### NVIDIA Blackwell GPU Architecture

The NVIDIA Blackwell GPU architecture is the latest generation of graphics processing units (GPUs) developed by NVIDIA, succeeding the Hopper and Ada Lovelace microarchitectures. Announced in March 2024 and now in full production as of 2025, it's specifically engineered as the "engine behind AI factories" to power next-generation accelerated computing, particularly for generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and massive-scale AI reasoning. Blackwell combines unprecedented compute performance, energy efficiency, and scalability to handle trillion-parameter models, making it a cornerstone for AI supercomputers, data centers, and professional workstations.

#### Key Features
- **Transformer Engine (2nd Generation)**: Custom Tensor Cores optimized for AI workloads, supporting new precisions like 4-bit floating point (FP4) for up to 2x performance gains in model size and speed without losing accuracy. Ideal for LLMs and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models.
- **Confidential Computing**: Hardware-based security for protecting sensitive data and models during training and inference, with near-identical throughput to non-encrypted modes. Includes Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and support for secure federated learning.
- **NVLink (5th Generation)**: High-bandwidth interconnect scaling up to 576 GPUs, enabling 130 TB/s bandwidth in 72-GPU domains (NVL72) for seamless multi-GPU clusters.
- **Decompression Engine**: Accelerates data analytics (e.g., Apache Spark) by handling formats like LZ4 and Snappy at high speeds, linked to massive memory pools.
- **RAS Engine**: AI-driven predictive maintenance to monitor hardware health, predict failures, and minimize downtime.
- **Blackwell Ultra Tensor Cores**: Offer 2x faster attention-layer processing and 1.5x more AI FLOPS than standard Blackwell GPUs.

#### Specifications
- **Transistor Count**: 208 billion per GPU, built on a custom TSMC 4NP process.
- **Die Design**: Two reticle-limited dies connected via a 10 TB/s chip-to-chip link, functioning as a unified GPU.
- **Memory and Bandwidth**: Up to 30 TB of fast memory in rack-scale systems; 900 GB/s bidirectional link to NVIDIA Grace CPUs.
- **Interconnect**: NVLink Switch Chip for 1.8 TB/s multi-server scaling and 4x bandwidth efficiency with FP8 support.

#### Performance Highlights
- Up to 65x more AI compute than previous Hopper-based systems (e.g., in GB300 NVL72 configurations).
- 30x faster real-time inference for trillion-parameter LLMs compared to Hopper.
- 9x higher GPU throughput in multi-GPU setups, with 25x energy efficiency gains for training and inference.
- Example ROI: A $5M GB200 NVL72 system can generate $75M in token revenue from AI inference.

#### Applications
Blackwell excels in:
- Generative AI and deep learning (e.g., training/inference on exascale models).
- Data analytics, database queries, and visual computing.
- Secure AI workflows, agentic AI, and physical simulations in design/engineering.
- High-performance desktops for creators and researchers.

#### Key Products
- **GB200/GB300 NVL72**: Rack-scale AI supercomputers with 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs for massive inference.
- **DGX SuperPOD/Station/Spark**: Scalable AI infrastructure, desktops, and compact supercomputers.
- **HGX B300**: Enhanced for AI reasoning with more compute/memory.
- **RTX PRO 5000/6000 Blackwell**: Workstation GPUs for professional graphics and AI acceleration.

Blackwell represents a leap in AI hardware, enabling the shift from training-focused systems to efficient, real-time reasoning at planetary scale.
