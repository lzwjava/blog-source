"Mogul" has a few main meanings, depending on the context:

### 1. **A Powerful Person (Most Common Modern Usage)**
   - Refers to an influential or wealthy individual, especially in business, entertainment, or industry.  
     *Example*: "Rupert Murdoch is a media mogul."  
   - This sense comes from the idea of a "magnate" or powerful ruler.

### 2. **In Skiing**
   - A bump or mound of snow on a ski slope, created by skiers making turns.  
     *Example*: "The black diamond run was full of moguls, making it challenging."

### 3. **Historical**
   - A title for a Muslim ruler of the Mughal Empire (16th–19th centuries) in India, derived from the Mongolian word for "Mongol."  
     *Example*: "Shah Jahan was a famous Mughal mogul who built the Taj Mahal."

If you have a specific context in mind (e.g., from a movie, book, or sport), I can refine this!
