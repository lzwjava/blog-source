### iPhone Personal Hotspot Behavior When Screen is Turned Off

Based on reliable sources, here's a clear explanation of how an iPhone handles Personal Hotspot (sharing cellular data) when the screen is turned off (i.e., the device locks or goes to sleep). I'll break it down step by step, addressing your questions about whether it stops immediately, after some time, continues until powered off, etc. Note that this applies to standard iOS versions (like iOS 18 as of 2025); behavior might vary slightly in beta releases or with specific carrier settings.

#### 1. **Does Personal Hotspot Stop Sharing When the Screen Turns Off?**
   - No, it does not stop immediately just because the screen turns off or the iPhone locks. 
   - The hotspot continues to function in the background, sharing your cellular data via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB, even while the screen is off. This is designed to allow uninterrupted use for connected devices (e.g., laptops, tablets) without needing the iPhone's screen to stay active.[1][2]
   - However, there are conditions that can cause it to turn off or disconnect indirectly (see below).

#### 2. **When Does It Stop Sharing (Auto-Turn Off or Disconnect)?**
   - **If No Devices Are Connected**: The Personal Hotspot will automatically turn off after about 90 seconds of no connections. This is a battery-saving feature to prevent unnecessary data and power usage when nothing is using the hotspot.[3][4]
   - **If Devices Are Connected but Inactive**: Connected devices (especially third-party or non-Apple ones) may disconnect if they don't send any IP traffic (data activity) within 90 seconds. The hotspot itself might then turn off if all connections drop due to inactivity.[5]
   - **Low Power Mode or Battery Saving**: If your iPhone is in Low Power Mode (enabled manually or when battery is low), it can restrict background processes, causing the hotspot to turn off or disconnect more frequently.[6]
   - **Other Triggers**: It could disconnect due to network issues, carrier restrictions, interference (e.g., distance from connected devices or electromagnetic sources), or if you've exceeded your data allowance. It won't turn off solely due to screen off, but prolonged inactivity or low battery might lead to it.

#### 3. **How Long Can It Continue Sharing?**
   - **With Active Connections**: It can continue indefinitely until you manually turn it off, the iPhone's battery dies, or you power off the device. There's no built-in time limit as long as devices are connected and sending occasional data traffic.[2]
   - **Screen Off Duration**: Even if the screen stays off for hours (or days), the hotspot remains active if conditions are met. For example, if Auto-Lock is set to a short time (e.g., 30 seconds), the screen will turn off quickly, but sharing continues.[7]
   - **Until Power Off**: Yes, it will keep sharing until the iPhone is fully powered off (holding the power button and confirming shutdown) or restarts.

#### 4. **Tips to Prevent Auto-Turn Off or Disconnections**
   - **Set Auto-Lock to "Never"**: Go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock > Never. This keeps the iPhone "awake" longer, helping the hotspot stay active even during low activity periods (though it drains battery faster—plug in if possible).[2][7]
   - **Disable Low Power Mode**: Settings > Battery > Turn off Low Power Mode.[6]
   - **Disable Low Data Mode**: Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options > Turn off Low Data Mode.[3]
   - **Use Siri Trick**: Lock your screen, then ask Siri to "turn on Personal Hotspot." This can keep it on permanently until you turn it off, bypassing some auto-shutoffs.[8]
   - **Ensure Activity**: On connected devices, run a background task (like pinging a site) to send traffic every minute or so, preventing the 90-second inactivity timeout.
   - **Reset Network Settings**: If issues persist, go to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This clears glitches but erases saved Wi-Fi passwords.[9]
   - **Update iOS and Carrier Settings**: Check for updates in Settings > General > Software Update, and Settings > General > About (for carrier updates).[3]

If you're experiencing frequent disconnects beyond these reasons, it could be a bug—try restarting your iPhone or contacting Apple Support/carrier. Behavior might differ slightly based on your iPhone model (e.g., iPhone 16 series) or iOS version.
