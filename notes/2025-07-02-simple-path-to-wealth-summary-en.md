title: Simplify Investing for Financial Freedom
translated: false
type: note
---

In a discussion with Rachel Smith, J.L. Collins, author of "The Simple Path to Wealth," outlined his philosophy on financial independence and investing. He defines wealth as **security and freedom**, achievable when **4% of your assets cover annual expenses** (the 4% rule).

Collins strongly advocates for **simplicity in investing**, primarily through **broad-based stock and bond index funds** (like Vanguard's VTSAX). He argues that simplicity leads to better results, lower costs, and outperforms most active managers. He recommends starting with his **blog's "Stock Series"** for newcomers before considering his book, noting that all book content is on the blog.

His own investment journey involved **decades of trial and error**, learning from mistakes like trying to pick individual stocks—a common pitfall. He highlights Wall Street's role in overcomplicating finance and pushing investors towards less effective, higher-cost options. Collins stresses that **"average" index returns are, in fact, superior** to what most active managers achieve.

A particularly controversial stance is his view that a **house is often a lifestyle choice, not a good financial investment**, advising people to "run the numbers" before buying. Other popular blog topics include "F-you money" and "How I failed my daughter."

For those looking to get their financial house in order, Collins advises **education** and understanding the distinction between **"investments" (like index funds) and "buckets" (like 401(k)s)**. He believes most people don't need financial advisors for investment decisions, as the simple path makes self-management attainable.

Collins identifies the biggest investing mistakes as **trying to pick individual stocks/managers** and **trying to time the market**. He emphasizes that **"time in the market is more powerful than trying to time the market,"** and that investors should **never panic sell** when the market drops. Instead, during wealth accumulation, market dips are opportunities to buy on sale, and during wealth preservation, bonds act as ballast to rebalance. He also advises against putting all your eggs in one company's stock, even your employer's, due to the importance of diversification.
