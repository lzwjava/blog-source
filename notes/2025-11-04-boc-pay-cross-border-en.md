### What is BOC Pay+?

BOC Pay+ is a mobile app from Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited (BOCHK) designed as a one-stop platform for local payments in Hong Kong and seamless cross-border transactions, especially in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) connecting Hong Kong and Mainland China. It allows users to handle payments, transfers, and rewards without needing a separate Mainland bank account. As a Chinese citizen, your registration using a BOC bank account works well—BOCHK supports this for eligible users with Hong Kong ties (like an HK ID). Linking and topping up from your BOC HK account is a standard feature, enabling easy fund transfers and cross-border use with automatic currency exchange (HKD to RMB).

### What Can BOC Pay+ Be Used For?

Here's a breakdown of its key features and uses:

- **QR Code Payments**: Scan merchant QR codes to pay at stores accepting UnionPay (in Mainland China) or Faster Payment System (FPS) in Hong Kong. You can also display your own QR code for merchants to scan. Supports password-free small payments for convenience.
  
- **Bill Payments**: Settle utilities like electricity, water, or gas bills by scanning FPS QR codes in Hong Kong.

- **Real-Time Fund Transfers**: Send money instantly and for free between banks (up to HKD 10,000 daily limit, no transaction count limit). Use mobile numbers, emails, bank accounts, FPS IDs, or QR codes as recipients.

- **Cross-Border Remittance**: Transfer money to friends/family in Mainland China from your Smart Account—ideal for small, frequent payments like living expenses or bills. Supports 7 major Mainland banks with auto HKD-RMB conversion. Great for GBA travel/commutes.

- **Collect Payments**: Generate your own FPS QR code to receive money from others.

- **Account Management & Top-Ups**: Link your BOC HK account or credit cards for top-ups, balance checks, and transfers back to your bank. Manage daily limits, virtual cards, and multiple BOC credit cards in one place.

- **Rewards & Redemptions**: Earn gift points on spending (e.g., via credit cards or payments), redeem them for eVouchers or cash (from HKD 1), and store/use them in the app's MyLink Mall.

It's widely accepted at labeled merchants in Hong Kong and UnionPay spots in Mainland China. Download it from the App Store, Google Play, or official BOCHK site (iOS 14+ or Android 8.1+ recommended).

If you're using it for Mainland trips, the cross-border tools make it handy without extra accounts. For more setup help, check BOCHK's app FAQ.
