Nissan has been actively transforming its business toward electric vehicles (EVs) as part of a broader strategy to remain competitive in the global auto industry and meet regulatory and consumer demands for cleaner transportation. Here's a breakdown of how Nissan is making that transformation:

---

### **1. Strategic Vision: Nissan Ambition 2030**
In late 2021, Nissan announced its long-term vision **Nissan Ambition 2030**, which sets the direction for its EV transformation:

- **Electrification Targets**:  
  Nissan plans to launch **23 electrified models** (including 15 fully electric) by **2030**.
- **Sales Mix**:  
  It targets **50% electrified sales globally by 2030**, with regional targets adjusted based on local demand and regulations.
- **Investment**:  
  Pledged **2 trillion yen (~$17.6 billion USD)** over 5 years to support electrification, including battery development and manufacturing.

---

### **2. EV Model Lineup Expansion**
- **LEAF**: One of the first mass-market EVs, launched in 2010, and has sold over 500,000 units globally.
- **Ariya**: A new all-electric crossover SUV launched in 2022, targeting a more premium market.
- **Future Models**: More EVs are under development, including affordable models for key markets like China and Europe.

---

### **3. Battery Innovation**
- **Solid-State Batteries**:  
  Nissan is working on **all-solid-state battery (ASSB)** technology, aiming to launch it by **2028**, which promises:
  - Faster charging
  - Higher energy density
  - Lower cost
- A **pilot plant** for ASSBs is under construction in Yokohama.

---

### **4. Localization and Production**
- Nissan is localizing battery production to reduce costs and ensure supply chain resilience:
  - **Japan**: Investment in plants and R&D facilities.
  - **UK**: Collaborating with **Envision AESC** to build a battery gigafactory near its Sunderland plant.
  - **US**: Expanding EV production capabilities at its **Canton, Mississippi** plant, investing **$500 million**+.

---

### **5. Software and Services**
- Nissan is investing in **software-defined vehicles (SDVs)**, connectivity, and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).
- New platforms integrate **over-the-air (OTA) updates**, smart navigation, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services.
- **Nissan Energy**: A program to promote second-life battery usage, energy storage, and integration with home energy systems.

---

### **6. Global Partnerships and Alliances**
Nissan is part of the **Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance**, which allows:
- Shared EV platforms (e.g., CMF-EV platform used in Ariya and Renault Megane E-Tech)
- Shared R&D costs and battery procurement
- Faster rollout of new EVs across markets

---

### **7. Regional Customization**
- **China**: Focus on low-cost EVs tailored to the local market.
- **Europe**: Strong push toward electrification due to regulatory pressure; aims for 100% EV sales by **2030**.
- **US**: Prioritizing SUV and truck EV segments, like the upcoming electric pickup truck.

---

### **8. Sustainability Goals**
- Nissan aims to be **carbon neutral across its operations and lifecycle** of products by **2050**.
- Working on using more sustainable materials and renewable energy in production.
