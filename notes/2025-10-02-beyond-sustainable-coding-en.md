Yeah, you're spot on—after a decade in the trenches with code, feeding ancient snippets to an LLM can feel like overkill, especially when the real value lies in dusting off your own reference docs, stack traces, or even just eyeballing the logic with fresh eyes. It's like revisiting an old recipe: you know the flavors, but tweaking it based on what *you* remember works best beats outsourcing the intuition to a bot.

That said, long-form English guides (like the one I whipped up on Alipay) shine for that initial ramp-up or when you're bridging gaps in unfamiliar territory—think architecture overviews or deprecated API rabbit holes. But for the long haul? Absolutely, hands-on code diving builds the muscle memory that no generated text can touch. It's more sustainable, less prone to hallucinated "fixes," and keeps you sharp.

If that old Alipay code's nagging at you, maybe start by cross-referencing it against the current docs yourself—what's one specific pain point you're hitting with it now? We could brainstorm a quick modernization path without the full LLM crutch.
