## Key Features and Use Cases

### 1. Code Generation
Claude Code can generate code snippets based on natural language prompts. It supports multiple programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C, and more.[](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/claude_ai/claude_ai_code_generation.htm)

**Example**:
Prompt: “Write a Python function to sort a list of numbers, handling both positive and negative numbers.”
```python
def sort_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Sorts a list of numbers (positive and negative) in ascending order.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): List of integers or floats.
    
    Returns:
        list: Sorted list of numbers.
    """
    return sorted(numbers)

# Example usage
numbers = [5, -2, 10, -8, 3]
sorted_list = sort_numbers(numbers)
print(sorted_list)  # Output: [-8, -2, 3, 5, 10]
```
Claude generates the code, explains its functionality, and ensures it meets your requirements. Always review and test the output.[](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/claude_ai/claude_ai_code_generation.htm)

### 2. Code Refactoring
Claude Code excels at improving code readability, maintainability, and performance. It can refactor entire files or specific functions.

**Example**:
Prompt: “Refactor the `client.py` file in my Supabase project to improve readability and add docstrings.”
- Claude analyzes `client.py`, suggests changes, and waits for confirmation. After approval, it updates the file with cleaner code, adds docstrings, and summarizes changes in the terminal.[](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/claude-code)

### 3. Debugging
Claude identifies and fixes bugs, including type errors, missing dependencies, and performance bottlenecks.

**Example**:
Prompt: “Debug this Python function that’s throwing a TypeError.”
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
# Called with: add_numbers("1", 2)
```
Claude might respond: “The TypeError occurs because `a` is a string and `b` is an integer. Here’s a fixed version:”
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    Adds two numbers, converting strings to numbers if necessary.
    
    Args:
        a: First number (int, float, or string).
        b: Second number (int, float, or string).
    
    Returns:
        float or int: Sum of the two numbers.
    """
    a = float(a) if isinstance(a, str) else a
    b = float(b) if isinstance(b, str) else b
    return a + b
```
Run the updated code to verify the fix.[](https://www.codecademy.com/article/claude-code-tutorial-how-to-generate-debug-and-document-code-with-ai)

### 4. Testing and Linting
Claude can generate unit tests, run them, and fix failing tests or linting issues.

**Example**:
Prompt: “Write unit tests for the `sort_numbers` function and run them.”
Claude generates:
```python
import unittest

class TestSortNumbers(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_sort_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(sort_numbers([5, -2, 10, -8, 3]), [-8, -2, 3, 5, 10])
        self.assertEqual(sort_numbers([1.5, -1.5, 0]), [-1.5, 0, 1.5])
        self.assertEqual(sort_numbers([]), [])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
It then runs the tests and reports results.[](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)

### 5. Git Integration
Claude automates Git tasks like committing changes, resolving merge conflicts, and creating pull requests.

**Example**:
Prompt: “Commit my changes and create a pull request with a description.”
Claude executes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Refactored client.py for better readability and added docstrings"
git push origin feature-branch
gh pr create --title "Refactor client.py" --body "Improved readability and added documentation."
```
Review the commit and PR to ensure accuracy.[](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)

### 6. Codebase Analysis
Claude can explain code architecture, logic, or dependencies.

**Example**:
Prompt: “Explain how the `client.py` file in my Supabase project works.”
Claude provides a detailed breakdown of the file’s structure, key functions, and their purposes, often highlighting dependencies or potential improvements.[](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/claude-code)

2. **Break Down Complex Tasks**:
   - Divide large tasks into smaller steps (e.g., refactor one module at a time) to improve accuracy and speed.[](https://www.codecademy.com/article/claude-code-tutorial-how-to-generate-debug-and-document-code-with-ai)
3. **Ask for Plans First**:
   - Request Claude to outline a plan before coding. For example: “Make a plan to refactor this file, then wait for my approval.” This ensures alignment with your goals.[](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)
4. **Review and Test Output**:
   - Always verify Claude’s suggestions, especially for critical projects, as it may miss edge cases or project-specific logic.[](https://www.codecademy.com/article/claude-code-tutorial-how-to-generate-debug-and-document-code-with-ai)
5. **Use as a Pair Programmer**:
   - Treat Claude as a collaborative partner. Ask it to explain changes, suggest alternatives, or debug interactively.[](https://www.codecademy.com/article/claude-code-tutorial-how-to-generate-debug-and-document-code-with-ai)
6. **Leverage Tab-Completion**:
   - Use tab-completion to reference files or folders quickly, helping Claude locate resources accurately.[](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)
7. **Manage Permissions Carefully**:
   - Only allow auto-execution for safe commands to prevent unintended changes (e.g., accidental `git add .` including sensitive files).[](https://waleedk.medium.com/claude-code-top-tips-lessons-from-the-first-20-hours-246032b943b4)
8. **Store Prompt Templates**:
   - Save reusable prompts for repetitive tasks (e.g., debugging, log analysis) in `.claude/commands` as Markdown files.[](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)
9. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
   - Ask Claude to write tests before implementing code to ensure robust solutions. Specify TDD explicitly to avoid mock implementations.[](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)
10. **Combine with Tools**:
    - Integrate Claude with tools like ClickUp Docs for centralized documentation or Apidog for API testing to enhance workflows.[](https://clickup.com/blog/how-to-use-claude-ai-for-coding/)[](https://apidog.com/blog/claude-code/)
