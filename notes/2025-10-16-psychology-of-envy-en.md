### Why Do People So Easily Become Envious?

Envy is one of those universal human emotions that sneaks up on us because it's wired into our psychology—it's not just a personal flaw, but a response to how we navigate the world. At its core, envy arises when we compare ourselves to others and feel a sting of pain or resentment because they have something we want: success, looks, relationships, wealth, or even just effortless confidence. This isn't random; it's often triggered by everyday triggers like scrolling social media, hearing about a friend's promotion, or seeing someone thrive in a way that highlights our own gaps.

Psychologically, several factors make us prone to it:

- **Social Comparison**: We humans are wired to measure ourselves against others—it's a survival mechanism from our evolutionary past. Back when resources were scarce, noticing what others had (or didn't) helped us strategize. Today, it backfires in a world of constant visibility, turning neutral observations into "Why them and not me?" moments.

- **Low Self-Esteem and Insecurity**: When our sense of worth feels shaky, even small differences amplify into threats. If deep down we doubt our value, someone else's win can feel like a personal loss, sparking bitterness or inadequacy.

- **Unmet Desires and Perceived Injustice**: Envy thrives on "what ifs." If we're chasing goals that feel out of reach—due to circumstances, timing, or effort—it breeds resentment. It's not just wanting what they have; it's the frustration that life seems unfair.

- **The Motivation Trap**: Ironically, envy can push us to improve (like "benign envy" that inspires action), but it often tips into "malicious" territory, where we wish for the other person's downfall instead.

In short, we're "easy" to envy because our brains are comparison machines in a hyper-connected, highlight-reel society. It's normal, but unchecked, it erodes joy and relationships.

### Tying It to "自卑与超越" (Inferiority and Transcendence)

You're spot on referencing Alfred Adler's classic work *自卑与超越* (often translated as *Inferiority and Transcendence* or drawing from his ideas on overcoming inferiority feelings). Adler, a pioneer in individual psychology, argued that envy is deeply rooted in what he called an "inferiority complex"—that nagging sense of "low dignity" or not measuring up, which starts in childhood from things like physical weaknesses, family dynamics, or social comparisons.

According to Adler, everyone feels some inferiority early on (it's universal, like feeling small next to stronger peers), but when it festers without healthy outlets, it manifests as envy, jealousy, or overcompensation (like aggressive superiority strivings). Envy isn't just petty—it's a signal of unresolved feelings of inadequacy. The "transcendence" part is the antidote: by building genuine self-worth through meaningful goals, cooperation, and contribution (not domination), we rise above it. Adler saw this as key to mental health—envy fades when we stop seeing others as rivals and start viewing life as a collaborative journey.

If you're diving into the book, it flips envy from a dead-end emotion into a call to grow. Ever notice how the most secure people seem envy-proof? That's Adler's point: transcendence isn't suppressing feelings; it's channeling them productively.
