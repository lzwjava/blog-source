### Notes on Finding Such Researchers:
- **Interdisciplinary Expertise**: Researchers excelling in all these areas are rare because LLMs and computer vision are distinct fields, and generative models (text, image, video) require additional specialization. Multimodal learning is often the bridge, so focusing on experts in vision-language models (e.g., CLIP, DALL-E, PaLI) is key.
- **Big Tech and Academia**: Many top researchers are affiliated with institutions like Google, Meta AI, OpenAI, or universities (Stanford, Berkeley, MIT). Teams at these organizations often collaborate, making it hard to pinpoint one individual with expertise in all areas.
- **Emerging Researchers**: Younger researchers like Hao Tan or those working on models like **CogVLM2** (Zhipu AI/Tsinghua) may be closer to your criteria due to their focus on cutting-edge multimodal and generative AI.[](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/09/08/cogvlm2-advancing-multimodal-visual-language-models-for-enhanced-image-video-understanding-and-temporal-grounding-in-open-source-applications/)
- **Conferences and Papers**: Check recent papers from conferences like **NeurIPS**, **ICCV**, **CVPR**, **ACL**, or **ICLR** for authors working on multimodal LLMs, vision, and generative models. ArXiv searches for terms like “multimodal large language models” or “vision-language models” can reveal active researchers.
- **X Platform**: Many researchers share updates on X. Searching for hashtags like #MultimodalAI, #VisionLanguage, or #GenerativeAI, or following accounts like @ylecun, @JeffDean, or @drfeifei, can help identify active contributors.

### Recommendation:
If you’re looking for a single researcher, **Hao Tan** stands out due to his direct contributions to **CLIP** and **OFA**, which cover LLMs, computer vision, multimodal learning, and generative tasks. For broader impact, **Jeff Dean** or **Yann LeCun** are giants whose work influences all these areas, though their focus is more supervisory. For a more academic perspective, **Jiajun Wu** or **Fei-Fei Li** are excellent choices with hands-on research in multimodal and generative AI.
