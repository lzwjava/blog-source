Here’s a clearer breakdown—no tables, just straightforward insights—on what it might cost for a large financial institution like HSBC or DBS to switch engineers from high-end Windows laptops to Macs.

---

### 1. **Hardware Purchase Prices**

#### **Mac (High-End)**

* A **16‑inch MacBook Pro** with the M4 Pro chip (24 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD) is listed at **SGD 3,499** locally in Singapore ([Gartner][1], [The Verge][2]).
* Base prices for MacBook Pros in the U.S. start at around **USD 1,599** for a 14‑inch M4 model; high-end 16‑inch models easily exceed **USD 2,499–3,199**, going up to **USD 3,499+** for top specs ([Wikipedia][3], [WIRED][4]).

#### **Windows (High-End)**

* A typical enterprise-grade Windows laptop runs about **USD 1,100** on average ([Forrester][5]).
* But more powerful configurations—like a high‑end ThinkPad—can cost around **USD 2,000–3,000**, especially when compared to similar Mac performance ([Gartner][1]).
* For example, the Dell “14 Premium” competitive with MacBook Pro starts at **USD 1,499.99** and scales up with GPU, memory, and display upgrades ([TechRadar][6]).

---

### 2. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**

Beyond upfront hardware costs, Macs often yield better long-term value.

* **Residual Value**: Forrester research shows that over a 4-year period, enterprise PCs retain about **15%** of their initial value, while MacBook Airs hold roughly **30%**—translating into substantial value retention ([Forrester][5]).
* **Lifecycle Savings**: Another study suggests using Macs can save businesses around **USD 843 per device** over a 3-year lifecycle, thanks to lower maintenance and IT support costs ([daylite.app][7]).

---

### What This Means in Practice

To estimate total—hardware plus lifecycle—cost for a high-end Mac vs. a comparable Windows laptop:

1. **Hardware Cost Example**:

   * **MacBook Pro 16" (M4 Pro, 24GB RAM)**: \~SGD 3,499 (\~USD 2,600).
   * **High-end Dell or Lenovo Windows laptop**: \~USD 2,000–2,500.

2. **Depreciation Recovery**:

   * After 4 years, a Mac might still recover \~30% of cost (\~USD 780), whereas a PC might recover only \~USD 165 (15%).

3. **Support & Maintenance**:

   * Savings per device across 3 years: \~USD 843 in favor of Mac ([Laptop Mag][8]).

---

### Summary in Plain Language

* **Upfront**: High-end Macs cost more—roughly 20–30% higher than high-end Windows laptops of similar spec.
* **Over Time**: Macs retain more value and typically require less IT support, evening out or even reversing the cost gap—especially for long-term deployments.
* **Enterprise Context**: For a bank deploying thousands of units, those lifecycle savings and residual value advantages can add up significantly.

### Final Thoughts

* **Upfront cost**: Expect MacBook Pro to be around **USD 2,500–3,500**, while high-end Windows laptops sit around **USD 2,000–2,500**.
* **Ongoing value**: Macs often end up cheaper when factoring in support costs and resale value.
* **Recommendation**: If your organization values long-term total cost savings, durability, and residual value, **Macs could be the smarter long-term investment for high-end engineering teams**—even if the initial budget is higher.
