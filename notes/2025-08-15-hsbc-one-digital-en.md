Here's a clearer breakdown of your questions regarding HSBC One and its UnionPay debit card in the Hong Kong context:

---

## 1. What is HSBC One Account?

**HSBC One** is an **integrated, all-in-one banking account** offered by HSBC Hong Kong. It consolidates multiple accounts—such as HKD savings and current, multi-currency savings (including RMB), time deposits, investments, and insurance—into **one streamlined account** with a **consolidated monthly statement** and **no minimum balance requirement** or below-balance fees.([HSBC Hong Kong][1])

It’s designed for digital-first banking—applying is fast (about 5 minutes through the HSBC HK Mobile Banking app) and includes handy tools like spending summaries, automatic payroll setup, Flash Friday rewards, and digital investment options.([HSBC Hong Kong][2])

In short, **HSBC One is a customer-facing product**, not an internal-only system—it’s a publicly available digital banking account with broad functionality and integrated multi-currency access.([HSBC Hong Kong][2])

---

## 2. What about its UnionPay debit card? Relationship to HSBC One?

HSBC One customers can apply for a **HSBC Mastercard® Debit Card**, which supports spending and ATM withdrawals in up to 12 currencies, with features like cashback, HSBC ATM access worldwide, and no extra currency conversion fees.([Statrys][3])

There is also mention that HSBC One allows you to apply for a **UnionPay ATM card**, which would function on the UnionPay network.([Wise][4]) This suggests HSBC offers both Mastercard and UnionPay options—but the **default debit card for HSBC One is the Mastercard**.

On user forums (e.g., Reddit), it's noted that:

> “UnionPay cards are not the default debit card… there is a UnionPay card you can ask to apply for.”([Reddit][5])

So, while UnionPay debit cards are available, they are **not automatically issued** with HSBC One. They must be specifically requested.

## 3. So, what’s the connection between HSBC One and the UnionPay debit card?

* **HSBC One is the account platform**—the central hub combining multiple banking services and currencies.
* The **Mastercard® Debit Card** is the standard debit card typically associated with HSBC One, offering multi‑currency convenience and app‑based management.([HSBC Hong Kong][1], [Statrys][3])
* A **UnionPay debit card can be issued**, but it’s **optional**, not the default. It’s available “upon request” to users who specifically want UnionPay network access.([Reddit][5], [Wise][4])

The UnionPay option may be useful if you frequently travel or transact in Mainland China, where UnionPay is widely accepted both ATM‑ and POS‑wise.([HSBC Hong Kong][6])
