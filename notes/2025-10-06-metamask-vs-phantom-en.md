### Key Differences Between MetaMask and Phantom

MetaMask and Phantom are both popular non-custodial crypto wallets that give users full control over their private keys. MetaMask is a veteran in the Ethereum ecosystem, while Phantom started as a Solana-focused wallet but has expanded. Below is a comparison across major aspects:

| **Best For**         | DeFi enthusiasts, developers, multi-chain EVM users                      | Solana users, NFT collectors, beginners seeking simplicity and low fees |
