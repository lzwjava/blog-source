### Getting from Haneda Airport (HND) to Your Destinations

Haneda Airport is conveniently located about 15-20 km south of central Tokyo, making it easy to reach attractions like Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree by train or bus (20-45 minutes). For Osaka, which is about 550 km west, options include high-speed train (Shinkansen) or domestic flights (2.5-3.5 hours total). Below, I'll outline the main options for each, focusing on cost-effective and reliable public transport. Prices are approximate in JPY (as of 2025) and can vary; use IC cards like Suica/Pasmo for seamless payments. Taxis are available but expensive (¥10,000+ for Tokyo spots, ¥50,000+ to Osaka).

#### To Tokyo Tower (Minato Ward, central Tokyo)

From there, walk 10-15 min or take a short subway ride on Toei Oedo Line to Akabanebashi (1 stop, ¥220). Total: 40 min, ¥500-600.
- **Airport Limousine Bus**: Direct buses from Haneda terminals to stops near Tokyo Tower (e.g., Shiba Park or Onarimon), running every 15-30 min. Travel time: 30-45 min, ¥600-1,000. Comfortable with luggage space.

Board Nozomi or Hikari Shinkansen to Shin-Osaka (2.5 hours, ¥14,000 unreserved seat; book via JR Pass if eligible). Total: 3 hours, ¥11,000-18,000. Trains every 10-15 min.

**Tips**: Download apps like Hyperdia or Google Maps for real-time schedules. If arriving late, check last train times (around midnight). For Osaka, consider a JR West Kansai Pass if planning side trips.
