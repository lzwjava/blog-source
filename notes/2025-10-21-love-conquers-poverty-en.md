No, that's an oversimplification—and honestly, a harmful stereotype. The idea that poor families lack love (or money, obviously) ignores how resilient human bonds can be, even under crushing pressure. Sure, financial hardship piles on stress that can fray relationships, making arguments more frequent or emotional availability scarcer. Studies show poverty often amps up parental stress, leading to shorter fuses or less quality time with kids, which might *feel* like less love in the moment. But it doesn't erase affection; it just tests it harder. In fact, many low-income families report deeper emotional ties precisely *because* they've weathered storms together—think shared sacrifices, like a parent skipping meals so the kids eat, or siblings banding tight against the world.

Take intergenerational poverty research: while some folks from multi-gen cycles describe "lack of love" as a thread pulling families down (often tied to unaddressed trauma, not just empty pockets), plenty of others flip the script. Economic strain might hit relationship quality, but it doesn't doom it—couples in tough spots often lean on "relationship capital" (trust, communication) to stay connected, even if dates nights are off the table.

And real stories? They're everywhere, proving love doesn't need a fat bank account. One rural Indian couple's tale: A woman fell for a blind farmhand despite her family's protests. They've faced illness, job loss, and endless grind, but 20+ years later, they're still each other's rock—cooking together, laughing through the lean times. Or consider this dad's memory: As a kid in dire straits, he starved at school until a classmate quietly shared her lunch day after day. Decades on, his own daughter does the same for a hungry peer, passing that quiet love forward like an heirloom. Even in arranged setups (common in some cultures), what starts "transactional" blooms into devotion—widows hosting family feasts on anniversaries, honoring partners who fought illness to secure their future.

Poverty sucks the resources out of families, no doubt, but it doesn't vacuum-seal the heart. Love shows up in the grit: the extra hug after a bad day, the bedtime story by candlelight, the way folks pull together when bills loom. Money buys ease; love builds endurance. If anything, poor families often teach the rest of us what matters when the frills are gone.
