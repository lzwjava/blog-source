### Overview
The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is a decentralized, non-profit corporation classified as a 501(c)(3) organization in the United States. It serves as a global hub for open-source software development, supporting a community of developers who create and maintain software distributed under the permissive Apache License. This license allows for broad reuse, including in proprietary products. The ASF emphasizes "community over code," prioritizing collaborative contributions from volunteers worldwide over rigid processes. As of 2021, it has around 1,000 members, and it operates as a meritocracy where active contributors can earn membership. The foundation provides legal protection for volunteers, safeguards the "Apache" brand, and hosts events like the Community Over Code conferences to promote its projects.

### History
The ASF traces its roots to the Apache HTTP Server project, which began in February 1995 when a group of eight developers (the "Apache Group") patched and enhanced the NCSA HTTPd web server daemon. The name "Apache" was chosen for its connotation of resilience and rebellion, inspired by a documentary about the Apache tribe's resistance against oppression. The foundation was formally incorporated on March 25, 1999, in Delaware, with its first board meeting on April 13, 1999. Initial members included key figures like Brian Behlendorf (a co-founder) and Roy T. Fielding. By June 1, 1999, the incorporation was fully effective after resolving legal and governance issues. Since then, the ASF has grown from a single project to overseeing hundreds, expanding into areas like big data, cloud computing, and mobile development.

### Mission and Governance
The ASF's core mission is to provide open-source software for the public good, fostering innovation in fields such as data processing, cloud infrastructure, search engines, libraries, geospatial tools, IoT, and more. It acts as a neutral incubator, offering tools, expertise, and support to help projects mature. Anyone can contribute—through code, documentation, or ideas—and newcomers are encouraged to join. Governance is handled by a board of directors (elected annually by members) for corporate oversight, while technical decisions are made by self-selected Project Management Committees for each top-level project. As of March 2025, the board includes members like Rich Bowen, Jim Jagielski, and Greg Stein. Financially, the ASF reported $2.31 million in revenue and $2.01 million in expenses for 2023, funded largely through donations and sponsorships.

### Key Projects
The ASF hosts over 300 active open-source projects, many of which power critical internet infrastructure. Notable examples include:
- **Apache HTTP Server**: The world's most popular web server software.
- **Apache Hadoop**: A framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.
- **Apache Kafka**: A distributed event streaming platform.
- **Apache Tomcat**: An open-source web server and servlet container.
- **Apache Spark**: A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
- Other highlights: Apache Arrow (in-memory data interchange), Apache ZooKeeper (coordination service), Apache Commons (reusable Java components), and Apache NetBeans (integrated development environment).

Projects start in the Apache Incubator before graduating to top-level status. For a full list, visit the ASF's projects page.
