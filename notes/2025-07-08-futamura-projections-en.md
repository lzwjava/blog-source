Yoshihiko Futamura is a distinguished Japanese computer scientist, widely recognized for his pioneering work in programming methodology, particularly in the field of partial evaluation. He is credited with the invention of the "Futamura Projections," which are fundamental concepts in partial evaluation and automatic program generation.

Futamura's academic journey began with a B.S. in mathematics from Hokkaido University in 1965, followed by an M.S. in applied mathematics from Harvard University in 1973, and a Ph.D. from Hokkaido University in 1985. His career includes significant roles at Hitachi Central Research Laboratory, a professorship at the Department of Information and Computer Science, and Director of the Institute for Software Production Technology (ISPT) of Waseda University. He has also served as an editor and advisory board member for prominent journals such as the "Journal of New Generation Computing" and the "Journal of Higher Order and Symbolic Computation."

His main research fields revolve around the automatic generation of computer programs and programming methodology. Beyond the Futamura Projections, he is also the inventor of the Problem Analysis Diagram (PAD), which has been adopted as an international standard (ISO8631) and a national standard of China (GB13502).

Futamura's work on partial evaluation, particularly the concept of generating a compiler from an interpreter, has had a profound impact on theoretical computer science and software engineering. He has contributed over 200 research papers and patents throughout his extensive career.

Even after retiring from Waseda University, he continues to be active in the field, serving as director of InfiniteBio and the President and Chairman of Futamura Institute, Inc. His expertise is also applied to novel areas such as drug discovery and gene therapy, where the Futamura Projections are utilized to formulate general theories and derive specialized applications for diseases like Cancer and Alzheimer's. He is a fellow of the Japan Society for Software Science and Technology.
