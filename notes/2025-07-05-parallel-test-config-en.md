To enable parallel test execution in your Maven project, particularly for the provided `MavenTest.java` class, you can configure the Maven Surefire Plugin to run tests in parallel. The `MavenTest.java` class uses JUnit 4 with dynamic tests to execute Maven commands for different problems, and the stack trace from your original error indicates that tests are already running in parallel (evidenced by `ForkJoinPool` in the stack trace). However, you can explicitly control parallel execution by configuring the Surefire Plugin in your `pom.xml` file. Below, I’ll explain how to set up parallel test execution and address the use of a `-DParallel` flag as requested.

### Why Parallel Execution Is Happening
Your test output shows `ForkJoinPool` in the stack trace, indicating that JUnit or Maven is already using a thread pool for parallel execution. The `MavenTest` class uses `@TestFactory` with `DynamicTest`, and the tests are likely running in parallel due to JUnit’s default behavior or an existing Surefire configuration. The goal now is to explicitly configure parallel execution and allow control via a command-line flag like `-DParallel`.

### Steps to Configure Parallel Test Execution

1. **Update the `pom.xml` to Configure Maven Surefire Plugin**:
   The Maven Surefire Plugin supports parallel test execution for JUnit 4.7+ (which your project uses, as it’s compatible with `DynamicTest`). You can specify the level of parallelism (e.g., `classes`, `methods`, or `both`) and the number of threads. To enable control via `-DParallel`, you can use a Maven property to toggle or configure parallelism.

   Add or update the Surefire Plugin configuration in your `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <project>
       <!-- Other configurations -->
       <properties>
           <!-- Default to no parallel execution unless specified -->
           <parallel.mode>none</parallel.mode>
           <thread.count>4</thread.count>
       </properties>
       <build>
           <plugins>
               <plugin>
                   <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                   <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                   <version>3.5.3</version>
                   <configuration>
                       <parallel>${parallel.mode}</parallel>
                       <threadCount>${thread.count}</threadCount>
                       <perCoreThreadCount>false</perCoreThreadCount>
                       <!-- Optional: Timeout for parallel tests -->
                       <parallelTestsTimeoutInSeconds>10</parallelTestsTimeoutInSeconds>
                       <!-- Forking configuration to isolate tests -->
                       <forkCount>1</forkCount>
                       <reuseForks>true</reuseForks>
                   </configuration>
               </plugin>
           </plugins>
       </build>
   </project>
   ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - `<parallel>`: Specifies the level of parallelism. Valid values for JUnit 4.7+ are `methods`, `classes`, `both`, `suites`, `suitesAndClasses`, `suitesAndMethods`, `classesAndMethods`, or `all`. For your `MavenTest` class, `classes` is suitable since each `DynamicTest` represents a problem, and you want to run tests for different problems in parallel.[](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/fork-options-and-parallel-execution.html)
     - `<threadCount>`: Sets the number of threads (e.g., `4` for four concurrent tests). You can override this via `-Dthread.count=<number>`.
     - `<perCoreThreadCount>false</perCoreThreadCount>`: Ensures `threadCount` is a fixed number, not scaled by CPU cores.
     - `<parallelTestsTimeoutInSeconds>`: Sets a timeout for parallel tests to prevent hanging (matches your `TEST_TIMEOUT` of 10 seconds in `MavenTest.java`).
     - `<forkCount>1</forkCount>`: Runs tests in a separate JVM process to isolate them, reducing shared state issues. `<reuseForks>true</reuseForks>` allows reusing the JVM for efficiency.[](https://www.baeldung.com/maven-junit-parallel-tests)
     - `<parallel.mode>` and `<thread.count>`: Maven properties that can be overridden via command-line flags (e.g., `-Dparallel.mode=classes`).

2. **Running Tests with `-DParallel`**:
   To use a `-DParallel` flag to control parallel execution, you can map it to the `parallel.mode` property. For example, run:

   ```bash
   mvn test -Dparallel.mode=classes -Dthread.count=4
   ```

   - If `-Dparallel.mode` is not specified, the default value (`none`) disables parallel execution.
   - You can also use a simpler flag like `-DParallel=true` to enable parallelism with a predefined mode (e.g., `classes`). To support this, update the `pom.xml` to interpret `-DParallel`:

   ```xml
   <project>
       <!-- Other configurations -->
       <properties>
           <parallel.mode>${Parallel ? 'classes' : 'none'}</parallel.mode>
           <thread.count>4</thread.count>
       </properties>
       <build>
           <plugins>
               <plugin>
                   <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                   <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                   <version>3.5.3</version>
                   <configuration>
                       <parallel>${parallel.mode}</parallel>
                       <threadCount>${thread.count}</threadCount>
                       <perCoreThreadCount>false</perCoreThreadCount>
                       <parallelTestsTimeoutInSeconds>10</parallelTestsTimeoutInSeconds>
                       <forkCount>1</forkCount>
                       <reuseForks>true</reuseForks>
                   </configuration>
               </plugin>
           </plugins>
       </build>
   </project>
   ```

   Now, you can run tests with:

   ```bash
   mvn test -DParallel=true
   ```

   - `-DParallel=true`: Enables parallel execution with `parallel=classes` and `threadCount=4`.
   - `-DParallel=false` or omitting `-DParallel`: Disables parallel execution (`parallel=none`).
   - You can override the thread count with `-Dthread.count=<number>` (e.g., `-Dthread.count=8`).

3. **Ensuring Thread Safety**:
   Your `MavenTest` class executes Maven commands (`mvn exec:exec -Dproblem=<problem>`) in parallel, which spawns separate processes. This is inherently thread-safe since each process has its own memory space, avoiding shared state issues. However, ensure that:
   - The `com.lzw.solutions.uva.<problem>.Main` classes don’t share resources (e.g., files or databases) that could cause conflicts.
   - Input/output files or resources used by each problem (e.g., test data for `p10009`) are isolated to avoid race conditions.
   - If shared resources are used, consider using `@NotThreadSafe` on specific test classes or synchronizing access to shared resources.[](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/fork-options-and-parallel-execution.html)

4. **Handling the Skip List with Parallel Execution**:
   Your `MavenTest.java` already includes a `SKIP_PROBLEMS` set to skip problems like `p10009`. This works well with parallel execution, as skipped problems are excluded before tests are scheduled. Ensure the skip list is updated as needed:

   ```java
   private static final Set<String> SKIP_PROBLEMS = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(
       "p10009", // Skips p10009 due to NumberFormatException
       "p10037"  // Add other problematic problems here
   ));
   ```

5. **Running the Tests**:
   To run tests in parallel with the skip list and the `-DParallel` flag:

   ```bash
   mvn test -DParallel=true -Dthread.count=4
   ```

   - This runs up to four problem tests concurrently, skipping `p10009` and any other problems in `SKIP_PROBLEMS`.
   - If you want to disable parallelism for debugging:

     ```bash
     mvn test -DParallel=false
     ```

6. **Addressing the `NumberFormatException` for `p10009`**:
   The `NumberFormatException` in `p10009` (from your original error) indicates a `null` string being parsed. While skipping `p10009` avoids the issue, you may want to fix it for completeness. Check `com.lzw.solutions.uva.p10009.Main` at line 17 (`readInt` method) and add null-checks:

   ```java
   public int readInt() {
       String input = readInput(); // Hypothetical input reading method
       if (input == null || input.trim().isEmpty()) {
           throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input cannot be null or empty");
       }
       return Integer.parseInt(input);
   }
   ```

   Alternatively, keep `p10009` in the skip list until the issue is resolved.

### Notes on Parallel Execution
- **Performance**: Parallel execution with `parallel=classes` is suitable for your `MavenTest` class, as each `DynamicTest` represents a distinct problem. This minimizes overhead compared to `methods` or `both`.[](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/fork-options-and-parallel-execution.html)
- **Resource Usage**: Parallel execution increases CPU and memory usage. Monitor your system to ensure `threadCount` (e.g., `4`) doesn’t overwhelm your hardware. Use `forkCount` to isolate tests in separate JVMs if memory issues arise.[](https://www.baeldung.com/maven-junit-parallel-tests)
- **Timeouts**: The `parallelTestsTimeoutInSeconds` setting ensures tests don’t hang indefinitely, aligning with your `TEST_TIMEOUT` of 10 seconds in `MavenTest.java`.[](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/fork-options-and-parallel-execution.html)
- **Thread Safety**: Since your tests execute `mvn exec:exec` commands, which run in separate processes, thread safety is less of a concern. However, ensure that test inputs/outputs (e.g., files) are isolated per problem.
- **Debugging**: If tests fail unexpectedly in parallel mode, run them sequentially (`-DParallel=false`) to isolate issues.

### Example Full Command
To run tests in parallel, skipping `p10009`, with four threads:

```bash
mvn test -DParallel=true -Dthread.count=4
```

To debug a specific problem (e.g., `p10009`) without parallelism, temporarily remove it from `SKIP_PROBLEMS` and run:

```bash
mvn test -DParallel=false -Dproblem=p10009
```

### Additional Considerations
- **JUnit 4 Limitations**: Your project uses JUnit 4 (based on the `org.junit.jupiter.api` imports and `DynamicTest`). JUnit 4.7+ supports parallel execution via Surefire, but JUnit 5 offers more flexible parallelization options. Consider upgrading to JUnit 5 if you need advanced features like per-class parallelism or custom strategies.[](https://rieckpil.de/parallelize-only-java-unit-tests-with-junit-5-and-maven/)[](https://www.baeldung.com/junit-5-parallel-tests)
- **Maven Version**: Ensure you’re using a recent version of Maven (e.g., 3.9.10, as in your error output) and Surefire (e.g., 3.5.3) for optimal parallel execution support.
- **Error Handling**: To make tests more robust, consider catching exceptions in `runMavenExecTests` (as suggested in the previous response) to log failures without stopping the test suite:

   ```java
   @TestFactory
   Collection<DynamicTest> runMavenExecTests() {
       return PROBLEMS.stream()
               .map(problem -> DynamicTest.dynamicTest("Test problem: " + problem, () -> {
                   String command = String.format("mvn exec:exec -Dproblem=%s", problem);
                   System.out.println("Executing command for " + problem + ": " + command);
                   try {
                       Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
                       // ... (rest of the process handling code)
                       int exitCode = process.exitValue();
                       Assertions.assertTrue(
                               exitCode == 0,
                               "Maven command failed for problem: " + problem + "\nError output:\n" + errorOutput);
                   } catch (Exception e) {
                       System.err.println("Exception for problem " + problem + ": " + e.getMessage());
                       // Optionally continue instead of failing
                   }
               }))
               .collect(Collectors.toList());
   }
   ```

This setup allows you to control parallel execution with `-DParallel=true`, skip problematic tests like `p10009`, and maintain robust test execution. Let me know if you need further customization, such as dynamic skip lists via command-line arguments or advanced JUnit 5 configurations!
