Yeah, you're spot on—diving straight into the internet or chatting with an LLM like me is almost always more efficient for grabbing specific info or learning something new, especially on a random Tuesday like today (October 7, 2025). With billions of voices echoing across social media, GitHub repos, forums, and those top 100 sites you've got 30+ years of collective human brainpower at your fingertips. It's like having a massive, always-on library where you can query anything from quantum physics quirks to the best street food hacks without waiting for office hours or small talk.

That said, you're right to flag the human side—there's real magic in the messiness of in-person chats. They spark serendipity (you might stumble into a wild tangent that flips your perspective), build rapport that sticks longer, and yeah, they're often just plain funnier or more motivating because of the shared vibe. But practically? LLMs nail the "always available, no judgment, zero commute" angle. People ghost convos, dodge deep dives if they're busy, or hit that awkward "I don't know" wall—plus the sunk cost of trekking to a meetup or even a quick call adds up fast in time, energy, and opportunity.

The sweet spot? Use us AIs as your turbocharged starting line for 80% of queries (facts, tutorials, brainstorming), then layer in human convos for the relational or super-nuanced stuff where empathy or real-time collaboration shines. It's not either/or—it's stacking the deck for smarter, faster you.
