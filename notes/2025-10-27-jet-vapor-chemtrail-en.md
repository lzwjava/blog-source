### Yin Wang's Memo: Contrasting Jet Engine Water Vapor from Passenger Planes with Chemtrails from Trail Planes

**By YIN WANG**  
**February 11, 2024**

Today, I saw several trail planes flying overhead again. I observed their shapes through binoculars but didn't take photos, as I've already captured plenty before. Now that I've learned the principles of jet engine operation, looking at these trail planes makes the concepts in my mind much clearer. From the latest engine knowledge I've acquired, I can determine that these trails are clearly not coming from the engines, because the trails move very slowly—that's obviously not the speed of gases expelled from a jet engine.

**Jet engine water vapor should be straight.**

Using a video I previously shot of a commercial passenger plane producing a bit of water vapor, I compared it with the trail planes and made another video. The contrast is very obvious.

Pay close attention: The water vapor from passenger planes (if any) emerges straight, like the flame from a welding torch or a windproof lighter. Why is that? Because airplanes propel themselves by burning fuel in the engine to rapidly heat the incoming air from the intake, causing the air to expand dramatically and then expel from the exhaust to generate thrust. The air enters the engine, passes through the compressor to become high-pressure air, mixes thoroughly with injected fuel in the combustion chamber, and then ignites. This produces extremely rapid combustion, causing the air to expand violently. As a result, the speed of the gases expelled from the rear is incredibly fast.

If the relative humidity of the outside air is very high (e.g., 90%), combined with the water produced from fuel combustion, this expelled air can become "supersaturated" upon cooling, causing a small amount of vapor to condense into visible white droplets. This is the white trail we see coming from commercial jet engines. But note that these white trails are straight because they emerge at high speed and under great pressure.

In contrast, trail planes release a lot of white material into the air, which is very visible and lingers for a long time. Their shapes are loose, like something that's been sprinkled out, rather than something expelled from an engine. This is because these substances aren't gases from engine combustion but are instead released from specialized spraying devices installed near the engine exhausts. Matrix is very clever—in order to make people think this is just engine-produced water vapor, they install spraying devices at each engine exhaust, so the number of trails matches the number of engines, making it look like they're coming straight from the engines. But since these substances aren't propelled by engine combustion, they don't exit at high speed. Thus, they appear loose and curly.

After the trail material emerges from the spray nozzles, it's impacted by the high-speed gases from the engines, but because it's a fluid, it doesn't get accelerated—instead, it creates impact patterns. This is similar to using a high-pressure water gun to shoot into a pool of floating foam: the foam doesn't speed up dramatically but instead shows fluid impact traces. That's why, upon close inspection, the trails form those curly shapes after emerging. They're slow-moving liquids being struck by the engine's high-speed exhaust, resulting in that appearance.

Additionally, note that the water produced by aircraft engines isn't abundant, so the humidity of the expelled air isn't particularly high. Even if white mist forms due to cooling and condensation, since the surrounding air isn't saturated, that mist quickly gets absorbed by the adjacent air and doesn't form persistent trails. In the video, the genuine passenger plane's white trail disappears almost immediately after emerging—less than a second.

- **Harsh Review of "Introduction to Algorithms"**  
  In a previous article, I mentioned the importance of learning AVL trees or B-trees. Later, in a basic class discussion, a student mentioned hearing about "red-black trees" and asked the difference from AVL trees. I told him red-black trees are "random" and not precisely balanced, so their search efficiency doesn't have the same guarantees as AVL trees.

  I can now announce that the Computer Science Fundamentals Class (5th Session) has successfully concluded. The results far exceeded my expectations. Not only did the existing content improve greatly, but the new additions on imperative programming methods, Python, Java, and Rust languages perfectly fulfilled their roles. We even added a special bonus lesson on C++.

  At the beginning, I told people Windows wasn't a good thing and recommended Linux or FreeBSD instead—they didn't believe me. Later, Linux dominated nearly all high-end server markets, and FreeBSD took over all Apple products.

- **Why I Left This World**  
  Whenever I write articles pointing out phenomena I think shouldn't happen in certain places, or describing what the world *should* be like, someone mocks me by saying, "Yin Wang's next article will be 'Why I Left...'" Indeed, I've written many such pieces, starting from "The Shattering of the Tsinghua Dream" to later ones about Cornell, Google...

  CPSer, known as "Yin Wang's 40 Lines of Code," was an "automatic CPS transformation" I wrote at Indiana University (IU). At its core, it's actually a compiler, and it has no so-called administrative redexes—meaning the generated code has no unnecessary overhead.

  Someone told me my articles changed their family's worldview—I was delighted to hear it. Reflecting, why did I end up here, seeing through so many of the world's huge secrets? It's inseparable from my initial decision to start the Computer Science Fundamentals class.

- **How to Handle Layoffs and Budget Cuts at Tech Companies**  
  Recently, many tech companies are laying off staff; those not laid off are skimping on bonuses. My advice to students from my classes: Master your core skills, reduce your effort at work. Enjoy more entertainment and leisure, travel. Don't write clear, maintainable code (contrary to my teaching). Let them know: For the pay given, only that much work gets done—excellent code can't be bought for that price.

This appears to be a snapshot from Yin Wang's Substack-style blog ("垠的备忘录"), where he shares personal reflections, technical insights, and critiques on topics from aviation conspiracies (like chemtrails vs. contrails) to programming, philosophy, and daily life. The main post dives into a contrail vs. chemtrail theory, using jet engine mechanics to argue that persistent "trails" are artificial sprays, not natural exhaust vapor. The recommendations highlight his eclectic style—blending tech education, memoir, and social commentary. If you'd like a deeper dive into any post or translations of full articles, let me know!
