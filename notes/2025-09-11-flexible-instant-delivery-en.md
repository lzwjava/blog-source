title: Flexible Instant Delivery Services Versus Standard E-Commerce
translated: false
---

You're absolutely right—**instant delivery (即时配送) services** (like Meituan, Ele.me, or Dada) are much more flexible for small errands or extra requests compared to **standard e-commerce deliveries** (JD.com, Pinduoduo, Taobao, etc.). Here’s why and how to navigate both scenarios:

---

### **1. Instant Delivery (Meituan/Ele.me/Dada) – Best for Extra Help**
These riders are **paid per order** and often have more flexibility to assist with small tasks, especially if you tip (even 2–5 RMB helps). Examples of what you can ask:
- **Carry heavy items** (e.g., a box of water, large groceries) to your door:
  > *“帮忙送到家里，有点重，给您5块红包，谢谢！”*
  > (*"Please help bring it to my home—it’s heavy. I’ll give you a 5 RMB tip, thanks!"*)
- **Buy small items** from nearby stores (if the rider is willing):
  > *“能不能顺路帮我买包烟/瓶水？给您10块”*
  > (*"Could you buy a pack of cigarettes/a bottle of water on the way? I’ll give you 10 RMB."*)
- **Wait for you** if you’re running late:
  > *“我下楼慢，能等我5分钟吗？谢谢！”*
  > (*"I’m slow coming down—could you wait 5 minutes? Thanks!"*)

**Why they’ll help:**
- They’re independent contractors (not tied to a single company like JD/Pinduoduo).
- Tips are a big incentive (many rely on them for income).
- Their routes are hyper-local (same building/community).

### **2. Standard E-Commerce (JD/Pinduoduo/Taobao) – Less Flexible**
These deliveries are handled by **company employees** (JD’s own logistics, Cainiao for Taobao, etc.) with strict routes and time limits. They **won’t** help with extra tasks because:
- **No tipping culture**: Their salaries are fixed; tips aren’t expected.
- **High volume**: They deliver 100+ packages/day and can’t deviate.
- **Company rules**: JD, for example, prohibits riders from accepting tips or doing errands.

**What you *can* ask (politely):**
- **Leave at a specific spot** (if they’re in a hurry):
  > *“放门口就行，谢谢！”* (*"Just leave it at the door, thanks!"*)
- **Call before arrival** (if you need to buzz them in):
  > *“到楼下打个电话，我下来拿，谢谢！”*
- **Handle fragile items carefully**:
  > *“易碎品，轻放，谢谢！”* (*"Fragile—please handle with care, thanks!"*)

**What they *won’t* do:**
- Carry heavy items upstairs (unless it’s JD’s "上门安装" service for appliances).
- Take your trash, buy things, or wait for you.

---
### **3. Workarounds for Heavy/bulky Items (JD/Pinduoduo)**
If you need help with large purchases (e.g., water, furniture):
- **JD.com**:
  - Choose **"上门安装" (doorstep installation)** for appliances (extra fee, but they’ll carry it up).
  - For water/heavy groceries, some JD Fresh (*京东到家*) riders *might* help if tipped (but not guaranteed).
- **Pinduoduo/Taobao**:
  - Look for **"送货上门" (doorstep delivery)** options (some sellers offer this for a fee).
  - Use **"同城配送" (local delivery)** services (like Dada) instead of standard Cainiao logistics.
- **Hire a helper**:
  - Use apps like **58同城** or **闪送** to hire someone to carry items upstairs (cheap, ~10–20 RMB).

---
### **4. Cultural Tips for Success**
- **Phrase it as a request, not a demand**:
  > ❌ *“你必须帮我拿上去！”* (You must carry it up!)
  > ✅ *“麻烦您帮忙送到家里，可以吗？”* (Could you please help bring it to my home?)
- **Offer a tip upfront** in the delivery notes:
  > *“帮忙拿上楼，给您5块红包，谢谢！”*
- **Be understanding if they refuse**:
  > Many riders (especially JD) are overworked—don’t take it personally.

### **Final Advice**
- For **errands/help**, stick to **instant delivery apps** (Meituan/Ele.me/Dada).
- For **e-commerce orders**, manage expectations—runners won’t go beyond basic delivery.
- If you frequently need help with heavy items, consider **buying a small foldable cart** (like IKEA’s *Rull*) or using **local moving services** (闪送/58同城).
