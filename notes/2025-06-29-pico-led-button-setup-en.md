To set up a Raspberry Pi Pico to run the provided MicroPython code, which controls an LED based on a button press, follow these steps:

### Hardware Requirements
- **Raspberry Pi Pico** (or Pico W)
- **LED** (with an appropriate current-limiting resistor, e.g., 220–330 ohms)
- **Pushbutton switch**
- **Jumper wires**
- **Breadboard** (optional, for easier connections)
- **USB cable** (to connect the Pico to your computer)

### Hardware Setup
1. **Connect the LED**:
   - Connect the LED's anode (longer leg) to **GPIO 25** (physical pin 30) on the Pico.
   - Connect the LED's cathode (shorter leg) to a **ground (GND)** pin (e.g., physical pin 3) through a 220–330 ohm resistor to limit current.

2. **Connect the Button**:
   - Connect one side of the pushbutton to **GPIO 14** (physical pin 19).
   - Connect the other side of the button to a **3.3V** pin (e.g., physical pin 36, 3V3(OUT)).
   - The code uses an internal pull-down resistor (`Pin.PULL_DOWN`), so no external pull-down resistor is needed. When the button is pressed, GPIO 14 will read HIGH (1); when not pressed, it will read LOW (0).

3. **Verify Connections**:
   - Ensure all connections are secure. Use a breadboard or direct wiring, and double-check that the LED polarity is correct and the resistor is properly placed.
   - Refer to the Pico pinout diagram (available online or in the Pico datasheet) to confirm pin assignments.

### Software Setup
1. **Install MicroPython on the Pico**:
   - Download the latest MicroPython UF2 firmware for the Raspberry Pi Pico from the [official MicroPython website](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/).
   - Connect the Pico to your computer via a USB cable while holding the **BOOTSEL** button.
   - The Pico will appear as a USB drive (RPI-RP2). Drag and drop the downloaded `.uf2` file onto this drive.
   - The Pico will automatically reboot with MicroPython installed.

2. **Set Up a Development Environment**:
   - Install a MicroPython-compatible IDE, such as **Thonny** (recommended for beginners):
     - Download and install Thonny from [thonny.org](https://thonny.org).
     - In Thonny, go to **Tools > Options > Interpreter**, select **MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)**, and choose the appropriate port (e.g., `COMx` on Windows or `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux/macOS).
   - Alternatively, you can use tools like `rshell`, `ampy`, or Visual Studio Code with the MicroPython extension.

3. **Upload and Run the Code**:
   - Copy the provided code into a file named `main.py`:
     ```python
     from machine import Pin
     import time

     led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT)
     button = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_DOWN)

     while True:
         if button.value():
             led.on()
         else:
             led.off()
         time.sleep(0.05)
     ```
   - In Thonny:
     - Open a new file, paste the code, and save it to the Pico as `main.py` (MicroPython automatically runs `main.py` on boot).
     - Click the **Run** button or press **F5** to upload and execute the code.
   - Alternatively, use `ampy` to upload the file:
     ```bash
     ampy --port /dev/ttyACM0 put main.py
     ```
     Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with your Pico’s port.

4. **Test the Program**:
   - Once the code is uploaded, the LED should turn on when the button is pressed and turn off when released. The `time.sleep(0.05)` adds a 50ms delay to debounce the button and reduce CPU load.

### Troubleshooting
- **LED doesn’t light up**:
  - Check LED polarity (anode to GPIO 25, cathode to GND via resistor).
  - Verify the GPIO pin (25) matches the code and physical connection.
  - Ensure the LED and resistor are functional (test with a multimeter or another circuit).
- **Button doesn’t work**:
  - Confirm GPIO 14 is connected correctly and the button connects to 3.3V when pressed.
  - Check that `Pin.PULL_DOWN` is appropriate; if the button is wired differently (e.g., to GND), adjust the code to use `Pin.PULL_UP` and reverse the logic (`if not button.value()`).
- **Code doesn’t run**:
  - Ensure MicroPython is installed correctly.
  - Verify the file is saved as `main.py` on the Pico.
  - Check the USB connection and port settings in your IDE.

### Notes
- The code assumes the button connects GPIO 14 to 3.3V when pressed. If your button connects to GND instead, modify the code to use `Pin.PULL_UP` and reverse the logic:
  ```python
  button = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)
  while True:
      if not button.value():  # Button pressed = LOW
          led.on()
      else:
          led.off()
      time.sleep(0.05)
  ```
- If you experience button bounce (flickering LED), increase the `time.sleep` value or implement software debouncing.
- For a Pico W, the setup is identical, but ensure you’re using the correct GPIO pins, as the pinout is the same.
