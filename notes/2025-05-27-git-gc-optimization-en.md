### What Git GC Does
Git GC (garbage collection) is a maintenance command that optimizes your Git repository by cleaning up unnecessary files and compressing data to save space and improve performance. It operates on the `.git` directory, which stores all the history, objects, and metadata for a repo.

Key actions it performs:
- **Pruning unreachable objects**: Removes commits, trees, and blobs that are no longer referenced (e.g., after rebasing or deleting branches). These become "loose objects" in `.git/objects`, and GC cleans them up.
- **Repacking objects**: Compresses loose objects (stored individually) into pack files (`.git/objects/pack`), which are more efficient. This uses delta compression to store differences between similar files, reducing disk usage.
- **Updating references**: Refreshes the repository's internal state, like rewriting the pack index for faster lookups.
- **Running related tools**: It often invokes commands like `git prune`, `git repack`, and `git rerere` (for reuse resolution) as part of the process.

Evidence: From Git's official documentation (e.g., `git gc --help`), GC is designed to "housekeep" repositories. For instance, a repo with 10,000 loose objects might shrink from hundreds of MB to a fraction once packed, as delta compression leverages similarities (e.g., between file versions in a code history).

### How It Works Internally
1. **Triggers**: GC runs manually via `git gc` or automatically when Git detects certain conditions (see below). It doesn't run on every command to avoid slowdowns.
2. **Process**:
   - Counts loose objects and pack files.
   - If thresholds are exceeded (e.g., >6,700 loose objects by default, configurable via `gc.auto`), it repacks aggressively.
   - It creates temporary files (e.g., `.git/objects/tmp_*`) to avoid data loss, then swaps them in atomically.
   - Milder modes like `git gc --auto` only prune without full repacking.
3. **Compression Details**: Uses zlib for compression. Repacking builds pack files where objects are stored as deltas (differences) from base objects, making it efficient for repositories with evolving code—e.g., adding a line to a file in a large codebase creates a small delta instead of duplicating the whole file.

This is backed by Git's source code (available on GitHub), which implements GC as a series of shell calls to pruning and packing utilities for reliability.

### Why It Runs Suddenly
GC often triggers "suddenly" because it's automatic, not real-time, to balance performance. Common reasons:
- **Thresholds hit**: After accumulating loose objects (e.g., from frequent commits or fetches without packing). Git checks this after operations like `git commit`, `git merge`, or `push`. If loose objects exceed the `gc.auto` limit (default: around 6,700), it runs. This is why it might happen after a burst of activity, seeming "sudden."
- **Prune schedule**: If `gc.prune` is set, it prunes stale refs periodically, but the main auto-GC is based on object counts.
- **Large operations**: Heavy rebasing or cloning can generate many loose objects quickly, triggering it.
- **Post-command hooks**: Some workflows or tools (e.g., Git hooks or IDEs) might invoke `git gc` after big changes.

To control it: Adjust settings like `git config --global gc.auto 0` to disable auto-GC if you prefer manual runs, or increase the threshold to reduce interruptions. Running it prevents repos from ballooning—e.g., the Linux kernel repo uses GC to keep history manageable despite its massive scale. If issues persist, check `git count-objects -v` for loose object stats.
