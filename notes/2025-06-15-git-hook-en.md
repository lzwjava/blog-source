title: Maven Compile Before Git Commit

Yes, you can run `mvn compile` in a local Git repository before executing `git commit`. Here's a concise explanation and steps:

1. **Ensure Maven is Installed**: Make sure Maven is installed and configured on your system (`mvn -version` to verify).

2. **Navigate to Your Git Repository**: Use `cd path/to/your/repo` to go to your local Git repository containing the Maven project (with a `pom.xml` file).

3. **Run Maven Compile**: Execute `mvn compile` to compile your Java code. This will:
   - Compile the source code in `src/main/java`.
   - Place compiled classes in `target/classes`.
   - Report any compilation errors.

4. **Check Compilation Status**:
   - If `mvn compile` succeeds (ends with `BUILD SUCCESS`), you can proceed with Git operations.
   - If it fails (e.g., due to syntax errors), fix the code before committing.

5. **Git Workflow**:
   - Stage changes: `git add .` (or specific files).
   - Commit changes: `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.

### Optional: Automate with Git Hooks
To ensure `mvn compile` runs before every `git commit`, you can use a Git pre-commit hook:
1. Navigate to `.git/hooks` in your repository.
2. Create or edit `pre-commit` (no file extension).
3. Add a script like:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   mvn compile
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
       echo "Compilation failed, commit aborted."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```
4. Make it executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`.
   - Now, `git commit` will only proceed if `mvn compile` succeeds.

### Notes
- **Dependencies**: Ensure `pom.xml` is correctly configured, and dependencies are downloaded (`mvn dependency:resolve` if needed).
- **Performance**: Running `mvn compile` before every commit ensures code quality but may slow down your workflow for large projects.
- **Alternative Commands**: If you want to include tests, use `mvn test` instead of `mvn compile` to compile and run unit tests.

This approach ensures your code compiles successfully before committing to the Git repository.
