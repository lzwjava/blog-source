### Playing Golf in Guangzhou

Guangzhou, in Guangdong Province, China, offers a variety of golf courses, mostly located on the city's outskirts due to urban density. As a tourist, playing golf is straightforward—there's no specific visa or restriction for foreigners in 2025, but you'll need to book tee times in advance, especially on weekends. Caddies are often mandatory (included in fees), and English-speaking staff may be limited at some clubs, so using a booking app helps. Expect to pay extra for rentals (clubs ~200-400 RMB) and transport (taxis or Didi rides from city center: 100-300 RMB one-way).

#### How to Book and Play
1. **Book Online**: Use platforms like BaiGolf (baigolf.com), Golf007 (golf007.com), or Tiger Booking (tigerbooking.golf) for instant reservations. These sites handle payments in RMB (via WeChat/Alipay or credit card) and confirm availability. Aim to book 1-2 weeks ahead.
2. **On-Site Arrival**: Arrive 1 hour early for check-in. Bring your passport for registration. Most courses provide buggies and lockers.
3. **Best Time**: Weekdays for lower crowds and prices; avoid rainy season (April-June). Rounds typically take 4-5 hours.
4. **Tips for Tourists**: Join a golf tour package (e.g., 4-day trips ~$580 including multiple rounds) if new to the area. Courses are 30-90 minutes from downtown Guangzhou.

#### Popular Areas
Golf courses cluster in Guangzhou's southern and eastern suburbs:
- **Panyu District**: Most accessible from city center; home to Dragon Lake and South Lake.
- **Nansha District**: Coastal, scenic; features Nansha Golf Club.
- **Huadu District**: Northern, near airport; includes Luhu Golf.
- **Conghua District**: Hilly, spa-like; Jiulong Lake is here.
Nearby Foshan (30-45 min drive) has options like Peach Garden for variety.

#### Prices and Courses
Prices are for 18-hole green fees (including caddie and shared buggy unless noted). They vary by season and promotions—check sites for 2025 deals. Expect 700-3,000 RMB (~$100-420 USD) per person. Weekends add 20-50%.
