The **Boston Tea Party** was a political protest that took place on **December 16, 1773**, at Griffin’s Wharf in Boston, Massachusetts. It was a pivotal event leading up to the American Revolution. Here’s a concise overview based on historical accounts:

- **What Happened**: A group of American colonists, frustrated by British taxation without representation, particularly the **Tea Act of 1773**, boarded three British ships (the Dartmouth, Eleanor, and Beaver) and dumped **342 chests of tea** (over 92,000 pounds, valued at about £18,000 at the time, or roughly $1 million today) into Boston Harbor. Many participants, organized by the **Sons of Liberty**, disguised themselves as Mohawk Indians to conceal their identities and symbolize their alignment with American rather than British identity.[](https://www.britannica.com/event/Boston-Tea-Party)[](https://www.history.com/articles/boston-tea-party)[](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/boston-tea-party)

- **Why It Happened**: The Tea Act granted the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies, allowing them to sell surplus tea at a lower price, but still taxed, undercutting colonial merchants and smugglers. Colonists saw this as an attempt to enforce taxation without their consent, reigniting the cry of “no taxation without representation.” Boston’s Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to let the tea ships leave without paying the duty, escalating tensions.[](https://www.britannica.com/event/Boston-Tea-Party)[](https://www.history.com/articles/boston-tea-party)[](https://www.masshist.org/revolution/teaparty.php)

- **Key Figures**: The protest was led by **Samuel Adams** and supported by figures like **John Hancock** and **Paul Revere**, with the Sons of Liberty playing a central role. Approximately 30 to 130 men directly participated, though thousands gathered at the Old South Meeting House to debate the issue beforehand.[](https://www.history.com/articles/boston-tea-party)[](https://revolutionaryspaces.org/explore/past-programs/boston-tea-party-250th-anniversary-commemoration/)[](https://www.bostonteapartyship.com/boston-tea-party-history)

- **Impact**: The Boston Tea Party was a bold act of defiance that united colonial resistance. Britain responded with the **Intolerable Acts (1774)**, including the Boston Port Act, which closed the harbor until the tea was paid for, further inflaming tensions. This led to the **First Continental Congress** in 1774 and, ultimately, the **American Revolutionary War** starting in 1775. The event also shifted cultural preferences, with coffee becoming more popular than tea in the colonies as a patriotic statement.[](https://www.britannica.com/event/Boston-Tea-Party)[](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/boston-tea-party)[](https://www.britannica.com/video/Boston-Tea-Party/-281362)

- **Legacy**: Initially called the “Destruction of the Tea,” the term “Boston Tea Party” emerged in the 1830s. It inspired other colonial protests and became a symbol of resistance, influencing later movements like the modern **Tea Party movement**. The 250th anniversary in 2023 was marked by reenactments in Boston.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party)[](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/250-anniversary-boston-tea-party-schedule-of-events/)[](https://revolutionaryspaces.org/explore/past-programs/boston-tea-party-250th-anniversary-commemoration/)

**Note**: The term “Boston Drop Tea Movement” seems to be a misstatement; you likely meant the **Boston Tea Party**. There’s no historical event explicitly called the “Boston Drop Tea Movement.” If you were referring to something else, please clarify, and I’ll tailor the response! Also, while I’ve used reliable sources, historical narratives can carry biases, so I’ve aimed to stick to verified facts and cross-checked details for accuracy.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party)[](https://www.britannica.com/event/Boston-Tea-Party)[](https://www.history.com/articles/boston-tea-party)
