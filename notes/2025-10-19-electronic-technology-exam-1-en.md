### 📝 **II. Sample Exam Questions**
Below are some typical questions based on the exam pattern and textbook content. These cover core topics like analog/digital circuits, semiconductor devices, and practical applications.

#### **1. Multiple-Choice Questions**
1. **What is the relationship between RMS voltage and maximum voltage for a sine wave?**  
   A. \\( V_{\text{RMS}} = V_{\text{max}} \\)  
   B. \\( V_{\text{RMS}} = 0.707 \times V_{\text{max}} \\)  
   C. \\( V_{\text{RMS}} = 1.414 \times V_{\text{max}} \\)  
   D. \\( V_{\text{RMS}} = 0.5 \times V_{\text{max}} \\)  
   **Answer**: B 【turn0search14】

2. **In a series DC circuit with a 3Ω and 5Ω resistor carrying 10A, what is the total voltage?**  
   A. 10V  
   B. 50V  
   C. 80V  
   D. 100V  
   **Answer**: C (Calculation: \\( V = I \times R = 10A \times (3Ω + 5Ω) = 80V \\)) 【turn0search16】

#### **2. Calculation and Analysis**
1. **Amplifier Circuit**:  
   Given a BJT amplifier with \\( \beta = 100 \\), \\( R_C = 2.2kΩ \\), and \\( V_{CC} = 12V \\), calculate the collector current \\( I_C \\) and voltage gain \\( A_V \\) if the input resistance \\( R_{in} = 1kΩ \\).

2. **Op-Amp Application**:  
   Design an inverting amplifier with a gain of -10 using an ideal op-amp. Choose \\( R_{in} = 1kΩ \\) and determine \\( R_f \\).

#### **3. Conceptual Questions**
1. **Semiconductor Devices**:  
   Explain the difference between enhancement-mode and depletion-mode MOSFETs.

2. **Digital Circuits**:  
   Describe the advantages of CMOS logic over TTL logic in terms of power consumption and noise immunity.

#### **4. Practical Problem-Solving**
1. **Oscillator Circuit**:  
   Draw a Colpitts oscillator circuit and explain how the feedback network generates sustained oscillations.

2. **Power Supply**:  
   Design a simple 5V regulated power supply using a 7805 IC. Include the required components and calculate the minimum input voltage.
