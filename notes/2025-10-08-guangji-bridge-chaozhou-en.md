### Introduction to Chaozhou's Guangji Bridge

Guangji Bridge, also known as Xiangzi Bridge, is a historic landmark in Chaozhou, Guangdong Province, southern China. This ancient structure spans the Han River, linking the Xiangqiao District to the Chengxi District and serving as a vital connection between the ancient city of Chaozhou and the nearby Hanwengong Memorial Temple. Renowned for its architectural ingenuity and enduring presence, it stands as one of China's four most famous ancient bridges, alongside the Zhaozhou Bridge in Hebei, the Lugou Bridge in Beijing, and the Luoyang Bridge in Fujian.

#### History
Construction began in 1171 during the Southern Song Dynasty, initially as a floating bridge supported by 86 wooden boats to accommodate the river's seasonal floods and shifting waters. Over the centuries, it underwent significant reinforcements, incorporating stone piers and arches to create a hybrid pontoon-arch design. This evolution allowed it to withstand natural forces while maintaining its functionality as a major crossing point for trade and travel. Designated a key national heritage site, the bridge has been preserved as a testament to medieval Chinese engineering.

#### Architecture and Features
Stretching over 518 meters in length with 17 arches, Guangji Bridge is celebrated for its unique layout—a blend of fixed stone sections and flexible floating spans that adapt to water levels. Its name, "Guangji," translates to "extensive salvation," reflecting its role in facilitating safe passage across the river. The bridge's timeless charm draws visitors for its scenic views, especially at dusk when lanterns illuminate the structure, evoking Chaozhou's rich Teochew cultural heritage.

Today, it remains a popular tourist spot, offering pedestrian walkways and opportunities to explore the surrounding historic areas. Whether you're interested in history, architecture, or local culture, Guangji Bridge provides a captivating glimpse into China's ancient ingenuity.
