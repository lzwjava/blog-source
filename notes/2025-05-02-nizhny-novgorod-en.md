Nizhny Novgorod is a major city in Russia, situated at the confluence of the Volga and Oka rivers. It serves as the administrative center of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and the Volga Federal District. Located in central European Russia, approximately 400 km east of Moscow, it holds a significant geographical position at the intersection of major transport corridors.

Founded by Grand Prince Yuri II of Vladimir in 1221, Nizhny Novgorod began as a wooden hillfort and a strategic outpost marking the eastern edge of East Slavic settlements. Its location at the convergence of two vital rivers contributed to its early importance as a defense stronghold and later as a prominent commercial center. In 1392, it was incorporated into the Grand Principality of Moscow and played a crucial role in the Russian campaigns against the Golden Horde and later the Kazan Khanate. The city's Kremlin, built in the early 16th century, remains a significant historical landmark. In the 19th century, the transfer of the Makaryev Monastery Fair to Nizhny Novgorod further boosted its economic standing, making it a major trade hub of the Russian Empire.

During the Soviet era, the city was known as Gorky from 1932 to 1990, named after the writer Maxim Gorky, who was born there. It transformed into a crucial industrial center, particularly known for its automobile manufacturing with the establishment of the Gorky Automobile Plant (GAZ). Due to its industrial and military importance, the city was closed to foreigners during the Soviet period.

Today, Nizhny Novgorod is one of the largest cities in Russia, with a population exceeding 1.2 million people. It remains a vital economic, transportation, scientific, educational, and cultural hub. The city's economy is diverse, with a strong emphasis on mechanical engineering, metalworking, and information technology. It is also a major center for river cruise tourism on the Volga.

Nizhny Novgorod boasts a rich cultural heritage with numerous historical and architectural landmarks, including the Kremlin, churches, and preserved buildings from the 18th to early 20th centuries. The city has a vibrant cultural scene with theaters, museums, and educational institutions. In recent years, it has also gained recognition as a host of significant events, having been designated the Youth Capital of Russia in 2023 and the first Capital of Culture in Russia for 2024.
