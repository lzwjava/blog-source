### Recommendation
- **For beginners or simplicity**: **Meld** or **VS Code** for their ease of use and intuitive interfaces.  
- **For power users**: **Beyond Compare** for its advanced features or **P4Merge** for a free alternative with similar power.  
- **For cross-platform, free reliability**: **KDiff3** is a great balance of functionality and accessibility.

To use any of these, ensure the tool is installed, configure Git with the appropriate commands, and run `git mergetool` when resolving conflicts. If you’re unsure, try **Meld** for its simplicity or **VS Code** if it’s already your editor of choice. If you need help setting one up or have specific requirements (e.g., platform or project size), let me know!
