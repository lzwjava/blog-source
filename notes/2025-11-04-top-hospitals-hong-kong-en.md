### Top Hospitals in Hong Kong

Hong Kong's healthcare system is world-class, with a mix of public hospitals (managed by the Hospital Authority, offering subsidized care) and private hospitals (known for shorter waits, English-speaking staff, and premium facilities). Public hospitals handle most emergency and routine care, while private ones cater to expats and those seeking specialized or faster service. Based on recent rankings, patient reviews, and expert guides (as of 2025), here's a curated list of top performers. I've focused on highly rated ones across both sectors.

#### Top Public Hospitals
These are affiliated with universities and excel in teaching, research, and high-volume care. They often have long wait times for non-emergencies but are cost-effective.

1. **Queen Mary Hospital** (Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong Island)  
   HKU's teaching hospital with 1,706 beds; renowned for oncology, cardiology, and trauma care. It's a major referral center with advanced robotics and research facilities.

2. **Prince of Wales Hospital** (Sha Tin, New Territories)  
   CUHK-affiliated with 1,300+ beds; top for neurology, orthopedics, and diabetes management. Features a dedicated children's hospital wing and cutting-edge imaging tech.

3. **Queen Elizabeth Hospital** (Yau Ma Tei, Kowloon)  
   One of Asia's largest with 1,928 beds; excels in emergency services, geriatrics, and infectious diseases. Known for its 24/7 A&E and community outreach.

4. **Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital** (Chai Wan, Hong Kong Island)  
   1,845 beds; strong in respiratory medicine, rehabilitation, and elderly care. It's a key player in pandemic response with specialized isolation units.

5. **Princess Margaret Hospital** (Lai Chi Kok, Kowloon)  
   1,686 beds; leads in rheumatology, rehabilitation, and mental health. Offers comprehensive stroke and palliative care programs.

#### Top Private Hospitals
These emphasize comfort, quick access, and international standards. Many provide A&E services and English/ multilingual support. Gleneagles frequently tops expat surveys.

1. **Gleneagles Hong Kong Hospital** (Wong Chuk Hang, Hong Kong Island)  
   Modern multispecialty facility (opened 2017) with 500 beds; voted Hong Kong's best private hospital in 2024–2025 surveys. Specialties: orthopedics, oncology, cardiology; 24/7 A&E and research partnerships.

2. **Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital** (Happy Valley, Hong Kong Island)  
   Established 1922 with 500 beds; premium care in fertility, endoscopy, and neurology. Features a nursing school and luxurious patient rooms with sea views.

3. **CUHK Medical Centre** (Sha Tin, New Territories)  
   Non-profit academic hospital (opened 2021) with 516 beds; focuses on holistic care with minimal waits. Strong in neurosurgery, oncology, and preventive wellness programs.

4. **Hong Kong Adventist Hospital – Stubbs Road** (Happy Valley, Hong Kong Island)  
   152 beds; Christian-affiliated with 50+ years of service. Excels in cardiology, urology, and corporate health checks; 24/7 A&E.

5. **Matilda International Hospital** (The Peak, Hong Kong Island)  
   Boutique hospital with 48 beds; award-winning for orthopedics, maternity, and women's health. Known for personalized care and scenic private balconies.

For emergencies, public A&Es are free for residents but crowded; private ones cost HKD 1,000–2,000 upfront. Always check insurance coverage, as private care is pricier (e.g., room rates HKD 1,000–10,000/night). Consult the Hospital Authority website for public bookings.
