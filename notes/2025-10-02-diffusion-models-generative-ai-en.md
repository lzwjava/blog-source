A **diffusion model** is a type of generative AI model that creates new data (like images or videos) by gradually refining random noise into a structured output. Here’s how it works in simple terms:

---

### **Core Idea: Noise to Data**
- **Start with Noise**: The process begins with a random noise image (or video frame).
- **Step-by-Step Refinement**: The model iteratively removes noise, transforming it into a coherent image or video that matches the desired output.

---

### **Key Steps in a Diffusion Model**

1. **Forward Process (Adding Noise)**
   - A real image is gradually corrupted by adding Gaussian noise over many steps.
   - This creates a sequence of increasingly noisy versions of the original image.

2. **Reverse Process (Generating Data)**
   - The model learns to reverse this process: starting from pure noise, it predicts and removes noise step-by-step.
   - At each step, the model uses a neural network (often a U-Net or transformer) to estimate and remove the noise, slowly revealing the final image or video.

3. **Conditioning (Optional)**
   - The process can be guided by text prompts, class labels, or other inputs to ensure the output matches the user’s request.

### **Why Diffusion Models?**
- **High Quality**: They produce sharp, detailed, and diverse outputs.
- **Stability**: The gradual refinement process makes training more stable compared to other generative models.
- **Flexibility**: They can be applied to images, videos, audio, and more.

### **Example: Image Generation**
- You start with a blank canvas of noise.
- The model iteratively “denoises” it, guided by your prompt (e.g., “a cat sitting on a couch”).
- After many steps, the noise transforms into a realistic image of a cat on a couch.

### **Diffusion Models in Sora**
In Sora, the diffusion model is paired with a transformer to handle both the high-level structure (transformer) and fine visual details (diffusion), enabling the generation of complex, high-quality videos.
