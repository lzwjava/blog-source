To run the `MultiMark.java` file directly, similar to how you run a Python script, you have a few options. Since you're on a Unix-like system (as indicated by the `~/projects` path and `ls` command), I'll provide steps to make running the Java program as seamless as possible. Here are two main approaches:

---

### **Option 1: Run `MultiMark.java` Directly with `java` Command (Java 11+)**
Since Java 11, you can run a single Java source file directly without explicitly compiling it first, which makes it feel closer to running a Python script.

1. **Ensure Java is Installed**
   Check if you have Java 11 or later installed:
   ```bash
   java --version
   ```
   If Java is not installed or is an older version, install a compatible version (e.g., OpenJDK):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
   ```

2. **Run the Java File Directly**
   Navigate to the directory containing `MultiMark.java`:
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/lzwjava.github.io/scripts/benchmark
   ```
   Run the Java file directly using:
   ```bash
   java MultiMark.java
   ```
   This command compiles and executes the `MultiMark.java` file in one step. The output (e.g., CPU cores, thread counts, and times) will appear in the terminal.

---

### **Option 2: Create a Shell Script for Convenience**
To make running `MultiMark.java` even more like running a Python script (e.g., `./multimark`), you can create a shell script wrapper.

1. **Create a Shell Script**
   Create a file named `multimark` (no extension) in the `scripts/benchmark` directory:
   ```bash
   nano ~/projects/lzwjava.github.io/scripts/benchmark/multimark
   ```
   Add the following content:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   java MultiMark.java
   ```
   Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` in nano).

2. **Make the Script Executable**
   Set execute permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x multimark
   ```

3. **Run the Script**
   Now you can run the program like a Python script:
   ```bash
   ./multimark
   ```
   This will execute `java MultiMark.java` under the hood.

---

### **Option 3: Compile and Run Separately (Traditional Approach)**
If you prefer or need to compile the Java file explicitly (e.g., for older Java versions or to check for compilation errors), follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Java File**
   Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/lzwjava.github.io/scripts/benchmark
   ```
   Compile the Java source file:
   ```bash
   javac MultiMark.java
   ```
   This generates a `MultiMark.class` file.

2. **Run the Compiled Program**
   Execute the compiled class:
   ```bash
   java MultiMark
   ```
   Note: Use `MultiMark` (without `.java`) because you're running the compiled class file.

---

### **Making It Python-Like**
To make the experience as close as possible to running a Python script, **Option 1** (direct `java MultiMark.java`) is the simplest, as it skips manual compilation. **Option 2** (shell script) is ideal if you want a single command like `./multimark` that feels like running `./script.py`.

### **Notes**
- **Java Version**: The code uses standard Java libraries (`java.util.*` and `System.nanoTime`), so it should work with Java 8 or later. The direct-run feature (`java MultiMark.java`) requires Java 11+.
- **Performance**: The `MultiMark.java` program benchmarks sorting with multiple threads. Running it directly or via a script won't affect its performance, but ensure your system has enough resources (CPU/memory) for the thread counts tested (up to 64 threads).
- **Directory Context**: Since you showed `ls scripts/benchmark/`, I assumed `MultiMark.java` is in that directory. Adjust paths if it's elsewhere.
- **Error Handling**: If you encounter errors (e.g., `java: command not found`), ensure Java is installed and added to your `PATH`. If the program fails (e.g., due to memory or thread limits), check the stack trace for details.

If you want to integrate this into a workflow with your Python scripts (`executormark.py`, `multimark.py`, `threadmark.py`), let me know, and I can suggest ways to combine them (e.g., calling the Java program from Python).
