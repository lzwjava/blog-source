The phrase "吃喝拉撒睡" (eat, drink, poop, pee, sleep) captures the basic biological necessities of human life. Beyond these, it’s absolutely possible for someone to choose to do nothing else in a day, assuming their basic needs are met and they have no immediate obligations. People can opt for minimal activity—lounging, daydreaming, or just existing—especially if they’re in a position where survival doesn’t demand more effort (e.g., food and shelter are secured). 

However, this choice might not be universal. For some, external pressures like work, social expectations, or personal goals drive them to do more. Others might find doing "nothing" mentally or emotionally challenging due to restlessness, societal conditioning, or a need for stimulation. It also depends on how you define "nothing"—some might see reading, scrolling on a phone, or watching TV as "nothing," while others see those as activities.
