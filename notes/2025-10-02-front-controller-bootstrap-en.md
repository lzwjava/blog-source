title: CodeIgniter Front Controller Bootstrap Process
translated: false
type: note
---

The PHP code you've provided is the main entry point (typically `index.php`) for a web application built using CodeIgniter, an open-source PHP framework. This script acts as a "front controller" that bootstraps (initializes) the framework, handles incoming HTTP requests, and routes them to the appropriate parts of your application. It doesn't directly render web pages—its job is to set everything up so that the rest of the framework (and your code) can do its work.

I'll break down how it works step by step, based on the code. This is a high-level explanation of the flow; CodeIgniter is designed for performance, security, and modularity, so it loads components incrementally and uses object-oriented principles. If you're new to CodeIgniter, think of this as the "conductor" that gets the orchestra ready before the concert starts.

### 1. **Initial Checks and Constants**
   - **CodeIgniter Version**: It defines `CI_VERSION` (e.g., '3.0.2' here), which tracks the framework version.
   - **Check for Direct Access**: `defined('BASEPATH') OR exit('No direct script access allowed');` prevents anyone from accessing this file directly via a URL (a security measure to protect sensitive code).
   - **Load Constants**: It includes configuration files for constants (e.g., `APPPATH.'config/'.ENVIRONMENT.'/constants.php'` and `APPPATH.'config/constants.php'`). These define paths, settings, and other globals.
   - **Load Global Functions**: Requires `BASEPATH.'core/Common.php'`, which includes utility functions used throughout the framework (e.g., for loading classes or error handling).

### 2. **Security Procedures**
   - **PHP Version Check**: Ensures PHP 5.4 or higher is running.
   - **Security Tweaks**:
     - Disables `magic_quotes_runtime` (deprecated feature).
     - Handles "register globals" (another deprecated feature that could expose variables globally). It scans superglobals (`$_GET`, `$_POST`, etc.) and unsets unprotected ones to prevent injection attacks.
   This section protects against common PHP vulnerabilities from older versions.

### 3. **Error Handling**
   - Sets custom error handlers (`_error_handler`, `_exception_handler`) and a shutdown function (`_shutdown_handler`) to log PHP errors/exceptions. This ensures problems are tracked instead of spitting raw errors to users.

### 4. **Configuration Overrides**
   - Checks for a `subclass_prefix` override (from `index.php` variables) and loads it via `get_config()`. This allows you to extend core classes.

### 5. **Composer Autoloader (Optional)**
   - If `composer_autoload` is enabled in your config, it loads Composer's autoloader (for third-party libraries). If not found, it logs an error.

### 6. **Benchmarking Init**
   - Loads the `Benchmark` class and starts timers (e.g., for `total_execution_time_start` and `loading_time:_base_classes_start`). CodeIgniter tracks performance here—times are logged/marked for debugging.

### 7. **Hooks System**
   - Loads the `Hooks` class.
   - Calls the `pre_system` hook. Hooks let you inject custom code at key points (e.g., plugins or extensions).
   - Later, it will check for and call other hooks like `post_system`.

### 8. **Core Class Instantiation (Loading Key Components)**
   - **Config Class**: First to load, as other classes depend on it. It handles configuration (e.g., database settings). If `$assign_to_config` is set (from `index.php`), it applies overrides.
   - **Charset and Unicode Handling**: Configures `mbstring` and `iconv` for UTF-8 support, sets defaults to prevent encoding issues.
   - **Compatibility Files**: Loads polyfills for older PHP versions (e.g., for string hashing, passwords).
   - **Core Classes**: Instantiates essentials like:
     - `Utf8`: For Unicode support.
     - `URI`: Parses the incoming URL/request path.
     - `Router`: Maps the URL to a controller/method (e.g., `/users/profile` → Users controller, profile method).
     - `Output`: Handles response rendering (HTML, JSON, etc.).
   - **Caching Check**: If there's a valid cache for this request, it skips the rest and directly outputs the cached version (for performance).
   - **More Classes**: Loads `Security` (CSRF/XSS protection), `Input` (sanitize GET/POST data), and `Lang` (language/localization).

### 9. **Controller Loading and Sanity Checks**
   - Defines a global `get_instance()` function (returns the main controller object).
   - Loads the base `Controller.php` and any subclass (extended controller from your app).
   - **Sanity Checks**: Ensures the requested controller/method exists and is valid:
     - Checks if the controller class exists (e.g., `Users.php`).
     - Verifies the method isn't private (`_` prefix) or already defined in `CI_Controller`.
     - If using `_remap`, it adjusts the routing.
     - If invalid, sets a 404 error flag.
   - **404 Handling**: If `$e404` is true, it tries the `404_override` route (from config) or shows a 404 page.
   - Stops benchmarking for "loading_time".

### 10. **Request Execution**
   - Calls `pre_controller` hook.
   - **Instantiate Controller**: Creates an instance of your requested controller class (e.g., `$CI = new Users();`).
   - Calls `post_controller_constructor` hook.
   - **Call the Method**: Uses `call_user_func_array()` to execute the controller method (e.g., `profile()`) with parameters from the URL.
   - Benchmarks the controller execution time.
   - Calls `post_controller` hook.

### 11. **Output and Cleanup**
   - If no `display_override` hook blocks it, uses `Output` to send the final response to the browser (e.g., renders the view/html).
   - Calls `post_system` hook.
   - Script ends here—PHP handles the rest (sending output).

### Key Concepts and How It All Fits Together
- **MVC Pattern**: CodeIgniter follows Model-View-Controller. This script routes to a Controller (your logic), which might load a Model (data/database) and a View (template/output).
- **Hooks**: Allow extensibility—e.g., run custom code before/after parts of the flow.
- **Environment Awareness**: Checks for `ENVIRONMENT` (e.g., 'production') to load env-specific configs.
- **Performance**: Uses lazy loading (classes instantiated only when needed) and caching to keep things fast.
- **Common Pitfalls**: If something breaks (e.g., 404), it's often due to misconfigured routes, missing controllers, or file paths not matching `APPPATH`.
- **Version Note**: This is from CodeIgniter 3.x. Newer versions (4.x) have a different structure.

If this script runs successfully, your app loads. Errors logged here can be checked in logs. For deeper dives, refer to the [official CodeIgniter docs](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/index.html). If you meant something specific (e.g., "how does routing work?"), provide more details!
