### What is an SR Latch?
An **SR Latch** (Set-Reset Latch) is a fundamental building block in digital electronics and computer architecture. It's a type of **flip-flop** that stores a single bit of information (0 or 1) and "remembers" it until explicitly changed by input signals. The "SR" stands for **Set** (to force the output to 1) and **Reset** (to force the output to 0).

A basic SR Latch is typically built using two **NOR gates** (or NAND gates in a variant) cross-coupled together. Here's a simple textual diagram of the NOR-based version:

```
   S ───┐
        │ NOR1 ── Q
        │    │
   R ───┘    │
             │
             └─ NOR2 ── Q' (complement of Q)
                  │
                  └────── feedback to NOR1
```

- **S** (Set): When high (1), sets Q to 1.
- **R** (Reset): When high (1), sets Q to 0.
- **Q**: The stored output (the "memory").
- The feedback loop between the gates makes the circuit "latch" the state even after S and R return to 0.

### What Does "Latch" Mean Here?
The term **latch** refers to the circuit's ability to **hold (or "latch onto") a stable state** over time, without needing continuous input power to maintain it. It's like a switch that stays in position after you flip it—until you flip it again.

- **Not just abstract**: While "latch" is a conceptual idea in digital logic design (an abstraction for memory behavior), it's implemented as a **real electric circuit**. You can build it with physical components like transistors or logic gates on a chip (e.g., in ICs like the 7400 series).
  
- **Logic vs. Circuit**: It's both!
  - **Logic setup**: In theory, it's a boolean logic model where the outputs depend on inputs and feedback (e.g., Q = ¬(S ∨ ¬Q) in the NOR version).
  - **Electric circuit**: In practice, it's wired hardware that operates on voltage levels (e.g., 5V logic). The gates are powered by electricity, and signals propagate as currents/voltages.

### Is It an Abstract Concept?
Yes, partially—**latch** is an **abstract model** in computer science and digital design, representing the simplest form of bistable memory (two stable states). But it's grounded in physics: the circuit exploits electronic hysteresis (feedback) to store state. Without the physical circuit, the abstraction wouldn't work.

If you're simulating or studying it:
- Use tools like Logisim or Tinkercad for a virtual circuit.
- Truth table for SR Latch (NOR version):

| S | R | Q (next) | Q' (next) | Description     |
|---|----|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0 | 0 | Q (prev) | Q' (prev) | Hold (latch)    |
| 0 | 1 | 0        | 1         | Reset           |
| 1 | 0 | 1        | 0         | Set             |
| 1 | 1 | ?        | ?         | Invalid (race)  |

This "hold" behavior when S=R=0 is what makes it a latch—it's memory!
