title: Jasmine Core Testing Framework Overview
translated: false
---

### Jasmine-Core
Jasmine-core is the core library of Jasmine, a popular JavaScript testing framework. It provides tools for writing behavior-driven development (BDD) tests, including features like test suites (describe blocks), individual tests (it blocks), and matchers for assertions (e.g., expect().toBe()). It's standalone and can run in browsers or Node.js environments.

- **Purpose**: Enables developers to write and run unit tests for JavaScript applications in a readable, spec-like format.
- **Installation**: Typically via npm (`npm install jasmine-core`).
- **Usage Example**: You can set up tests manually or integrate with tools like Karma. It's open-source and maintained on GitHub (https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine), with the latest version (as of my last update) being around 5.x.
- **Evidence of Relevance**: It's a foundational dependency for many JavaScript testing setups, used by projects like Angular and React apps for TDD/BDD practices.

### Karma-Jasmine-HTML-Reporter
The karma-jasmine-html-reporter is an NPM package that provides an HTML-based reporter plugin for Karma, the JavaScript test runner. It integrates with Jasmine tests by displaying results in a user-friendly web interface, showing passed/failed tests, stack traces, and timing info, all rendered in an HTML page that updates in real-time during test execution.

- **Purpose**: Enhances test feedback by offering a browser-based HTML UI instead of console output, making debugging easier for developers. It relies on jasmine-core for test logic and karma for running tests across multiple browsers.
- **Installation**: Via npm (`npm install karma-jasmine-html-reporter --save-dev`).
- **Configuration**: Added to Karma's config file (e.g., `karma.conf.js`) as a plugin and reporter. Requires both karma and karma-jasmine to be set up.
- **Evidence of Relevance**: It's a popular choice for Karma users, with documentation on the official Karma site (https://karma-runner.github.io) and frequent updates. It doesn't alter test execution but improves visualization, as seen in many dev workflows.

Both tools are often used together: jasmine-core handles the testing logic, while karma-jasmine-html-reporter visualizes results in a Karma-run test suite. If you're setting up JS testing, start with Karma's docs for integration.
