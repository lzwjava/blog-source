title: Comparing JSON Parsing Speeds Across Languages
translated: false
---

Comparing JSON parsing speeds across different languages like Rust, Java, and C is complex because performance depends on many factors:

* **Library Choice:** Each language has multiple JSON libraries, and their performance can vary wildly. Some focus on speed, others on ease of use or features.
* **Data Structure:** Parsing into a strongly-typed struct/object is generally faster than parsing into a generic, untyped `Value` (like `serde_json::Value` in Rust or `Map<String, Object>` in Java) because the parser knows the data shape beforehand and can avoid dynamic lookups and allocations.
* **JSON Document Size and Complexity:** Performance can differ for small vs. large JSON files, and for flat vs. deeply nested structures.
* **Zero-copy vs. Copying:** Some parsers try to minimize copying data, working directly on the input buffer, which can be faster.
* **Optimization Flags/Settings:** Compiling with release profiles and specific compiler flags (e.g., SIMD instructions) can significantly impact performance.
* **Runtime Environment:** JVM warm-up in Java, operating system, and hardware all play a role.
* **Benchmarking Methodology:** Consistent and fair benchmarks are crucial.

**General Observations and Fastest Libraries:**

Here's a general overview, keeping in mind that specific benchmarks can yield varying results:

**Rust:**

* **`serde_json`**: This is the most popular and widely used JSON library in Rust. It's generally fast, especially when deserializing into custom structs.
* **`json-rust`**: Benchmarks sometimes show `json-rust` as faster than `serde_json` for general object parsing, particularly for large objects.
* **`simd-json`**: This is a Rust port of the highly optimized C++ `simdjson` library, leveraging SIMD instructions for very fast parsing on compatible CPUs. It can be significantly faster, especially for large JSON files. It also has `serde` compatibility.
* **`jsonic`**: Aims for high-speed extraction and a small footprint, and does not convert JSON to structs initially.
* **`hifijson`**: Focuses on high-fidelity parsing (preserving input data faithfully) and aims for minimal allocations. Performance is mixed, being faster on numbers and strings without escape sequences but slower on keywords and deeply nested arrays.

**Java:**

* **`jsoniter` (Json-Iterator)**: Often cited as one of the fastest JSON parsers in Java, claiming to be 3x faster than Jackson/Gson/Fastjson in some scenarios. It uses lazy parsing for schema-less data extraction.
* **`Jackson`**: A very popular and powerful JSON library. Its streaming API can be very fast when the format is known. Jackson generally performs well with large JSON files.
* **`GSON`**: Another widely used Google library. Benchmarks have shown GSON to be very fast for small JSON files.
* **`LazyJSON`**: Aims for very fast parsing, especially for extracting individual JSON objects from an array by maintaining index locations, minimizing work until data is accessed.

**C/C++:**

* **`simdjson`**: This C++ library is a groundbreaking parser that uses SIMD instructions to achieve extremely high parsing speeds, often outperforming other C++ libraries. It's so fast that it has inspired ports to other languages, including Rust's `simd-json`.
* **`RapidJSON`**: A highly optimized C++ JSON parser and generator that emphasizes performance and memory efficiency.
* **`Jsonifier`**: A newer C++ library that claims to be very fast, with reflection for member names and compile-time hash maps for parsing.

**Direct Comparison (General Trends):**

* **C/C++ (especially with SIMD libraries like `simdjson`) often hold the edge in raw parsing speed.** This is due to direct memory management, highly optimized low-level operations, and the ability to leverage CPU-specific instructions (SIMD).
* **Rust, with libraries like `simd-json` (a port of `simdjson`), can achieve performance very close to C/C++.** Rust's memory safety guarantees (without a garbage collector) and control over data layout allow for highly optimized parsing. `serde_json` is also very performant when deserializing into known Rust structs.
* **Java's fastest libraries (like `jsoniter` and optimized `Jackson` usage) are highly performant.** While Java has the overhead of the JVM and garbage collection, its JIT compiler can produce highly optimized code, and its JSON libraries are incredibly mature and optimized. In some specific microbenchmarks, Java has even been observed to be faster than Rust or C in certain scenarios due to specific optimizations or workloads (e.g., heavy allocation of very small objects).

**Key Takeaway:**

For absolute, raw parsing speed, highly optimized C/C++ libraries (especially those using SIMD) are often at the top. However, Rust's best JSON parsers (like `simd-json` and `serde_json` when used optimally) can come very close. Java's leading libraries also offer excellent performance, and for many applications, the difference might be negligible compared to the development speed and ecosystem benefits of each language.

**To get the most accurate comparison for your specific use case, it's always recommended to perform your own benchmarks with your actual JSON data and target hardware.**
