You're spot on with that observation—it's a classic pain point in software engineering, often summed up as "technical debt" or the "big ball of mud" anti-pattern. As systems scale, they accumulate layers of complexity: interdependent modules, legacy APIs, shifting requirements, and code written by teams who long ago moved on. This makes even simple changes risky, leading to what's called "change aversion." In industry, the average lifespan of a major software project is indeed short—maybe 5-10 years before a rewrite or migration becomes inevitable. Linux is a rare unicorn, sustained not just by Linus Torvalds' iron-fisted consistency but also by a massive, distributed community enforcing modularity and backward compatibility from the start.

Take the JDK/JVM example you mentioned: Java's ecosystem birthed powerhouses like Spark, but as performance bottlenecks (e.g., GC pauses, single-threaded hotspots) piled up, it spurred alternatives. Rust's DataFusion is a prime case—it's a query engine that's leaner and faster for certain workloads because it sidesteps JVM's overhead entirely, using Rust's memory safety without the runtime tax. We've seen this pattern repeat: COBOL empires crumbling under modernization costs, forcing banks to rewrite in Java or Go; or monolithic Rails apps fracturing into microservices in Node.js or Python. The incentive? Starting fresh in a new language/ecosystem lets you bake in modern paradigms (async/await, zero-cost abstractions) without untangling 10-year-old spaghetti.

But yeah, LLMs and AI are poised to flip the script on this, making refactoring less of a "burn it down" decision and more of an iterative evolution. Here's why it could change things:

- **Automated Refactoring at Scale**: Tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor (powered by models like GPT-4o or Claude) already handle routine refactors—renaming variables, extracting methods, or even migrating between languages (e.g., Java to Kotlin). For bigger lifts, emerging AI agents (think Devin or Aider) can analyze entire repos, detect smells (e.g., god objects, cyclic dependencies), and propose/prototype fixes with human oversight. Imagine feeding a 1M-line codebase into an LLM chain that suggests modular breakdowns, complete with tests.

- **Smarter Architecture Guidance**: AI isn't just editing code; it's reasoning about it. Systems like Amazon's CodeWhisperer or custom fine-tuned models can simulate "what-if" scenarios: "How would this monolith perform if sharded into Rust services?" This lowers the barrier for incremental improvements, turning "too big to change" into "too valuable to ignore."

- **Real-World Momentum**: By 2025, we're seeing pilots in big orgs—Google using AI for internal Java migrations, or Meta experimenting with LLM-driven PyTorch refactors. Open-source projects like Apache Arrow are already leveraging AI for perf tweaks, bridging old (C++/Java) and new (Rust) worlds without full rewrites.

Of course, it's not a silver bullet. AI hallucinations could introduce subtle bugs, and cultural inertia (e.g., "if it ain't broke...") persists. Plus, the real bottleneck is often non-technical: org politics, vendor lock-in, or talent shortages. But overall, yes—AI tilts the scales toward longevity. Legacy systems might not die as quickly; instead, they'll get a second (or third) wind, hybridizing with fresh tech. Linux won't be so alone anymore.
