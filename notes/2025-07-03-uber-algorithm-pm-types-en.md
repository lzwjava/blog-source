You're correct, and I appreciate the clarification. At Uber, **Algorithm Product Manager** (sometimes referred to as AI Product Manager or Marketplace PM with a focus on algorithms) is indeed a distinct type of product management role, particularly given Uber’s heavy reliance on machine learning (ML) and algorithmic systems. Below, I’ll revise the list to include Algorithm PM as one of the five types, replacing the previously mentioned Data Product Manager, and provide details on this role based on available information.

### Five Types of Product Managers at Uber

1. **Consumer Product Manager**  
   - **Focus**: Designs products for end-users (riders, eaters) to enhance engagement and satisfaction, such as improving the Uber app or Uber Eats ordering experience.  
   - **Responsibilities**: Analyzes user behavior and market trends to optimize consumer funnels, collaborating with design and marketing teams.  
   - **Example Projects**: Streamlining the Uber Eats checkout process or adding group ordering features.

2. **Platform Product Manager**  
   - **Focus**: Manages the technical infrastructure, such as APIs, marketplace systems, or experimentation platforms, ensuring scalability and reliability.  
   - **Responsibilities**: Works with engineering and data science teams to build systems like matching algorithms or pricing engines.  
   - **Example Projects**: Scaling Uber’s machine learning platform or enhancing the experimentation framework.

3. **Business Product Manager (B2B Product Manager)**  
   - **Focus**: Develops products for corporate clients, like Uber for Business or Eats for Business, catering to enterprise needs.  
   - **Responsibilities**: Collaborates with sales and operations to address business client needs, focusing on retention and adoption.  
   - **Example Projects**: Building Uber Vouchers or scaling Eats for Business for corporate meal programs.

4. **Growth Product Manager**  
   - **Focus**: Drives user acquisition, engagement, and revenue growth across Uber’s ecosystem, such as converting riders to Uber Eats users.  
   - **Responsibilities**: Uses data-driven strategies and A/B testing to optimize onboarding and key metrics like order frequency.  
   - **Example Projects**: Optimizing ad experiences or scaling consumer growth platforms.

5. **Algorithm Product Manager**  
   - **Focus**: Oversees the development and optimization of machine learning and algorithmic systems that power Uber’s core operations, such as dynamic pricing, rider-driver matching, and ETA calculations.  
   - **Responsibilities**: Collaborates with data scientists, machine learning engineers, and software engineers to design, test, and deploy algorithms that drive efficiency, fairness, and profitability. They translate business needs into algorithmic solutions, manage complex data pipelines, and ensure real-time performance at scale. Requires strong technical fluency in ML workflows and algorithmic decision-making.  
   - **Example Projects**: Improving the dynamic pricing (surge pricing) algorithm or optimizing the rider-driver matching algorithm to reduce wait times.[](https://www.productmanagementexercises.com/blog/fundamentals-ai-product-management/)[](https://www.uber.com/global/en/careers/list/140770/)[](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/product-manager-marketplace-dynamic-pricing-at-uber-186334769)

**Additional Context**:  
Algorithm PMs are critical at Uber due to the company’s reliance on ML for nearly every user interaction, from authentication to pricing and routing. These roles demand a deep understanding of marketplace dynamics and technical expertise to work with cross-functional teams on complex, data-driven systems.
