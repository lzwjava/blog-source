### What is Ant Bank in Alipay HK?

Ant Bank (Hong Kong) is a fully digital virtual bank licensed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and wholly owned by Ant International, the international arm of Ant Group (the company behind Alipay). Launched in 2019, it serves as the official banking partner for AlipayHK, the Hong Kong version of the Alipay mobile payment app. 

Key features and services integrated into AlipayHK include:
- **Savings and deposits**: High-interest eM+ savings accounts with no minimum balance.
- **Loans and credit**: Products like Ant Bank PayLater, a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) option allowing installment payments for purchases over HKD 100 via AlipayHK.
- **Wealth management**: A mini-app within AlipayHK for investing in funds and other products.
- **Payments and transfers**: Seamless integration for cross-border payments, including to mainland China, Japan, and other regions.

You can access Ant Bank services directly through the AlipayHK app without needing a separate download—it's embedded as a mini-app for easy banking on the go.

### Can You Open an Ant Bank Account as a Mainland Chinese Citizen with a Macau/HK Pass Card or Home Return Permit?

Yes, as a mainland Chinese citizen, you can open an Ant Bank account in Hong Kong using your Chinese Mainland Resident Identity Card (combined with your Home Return Permit, also known as the Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao). The "Macau HK pass card" likely refers to the same Home Return Permit, which allows mainland residents to travel to and stay in Hong Kong/Macau.

#### Key Eligibility and Requirements:
- **Age**: Must be 18 years or older.
- **ID Documents**: 
  - Valid Chinese Mainland Resident Identity Card.
  - Home Return Permit (as proof of your visit and eligibility to open accounts in HK).
  - No HKID required—mainland Chinese ID is explicitly accepted for virtual banks like Ant Bank.
- **Location**: You must be physically present in Hong Kong to complete the process (virtual banks require in-person verification for non-residents).
- **Other**: A Hong Kong mobile number (you can get a tourist SIM upon arrival) and proof of address (e.g., hotel booking or the permit itself may suffice for short stays).
- **Process**:
  1. Download the AlipayHK app (available on iOS/Android) and register an account using your Chinese phone number or email.
  2. In the app, navigate to the Ant Bank mini-app.
  3. Submit your ID details and permit for eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer) verification—approval is usually instant or within minutes.
  4. No initial deposit is required, and there's no opening fee.

This applies to personal accounts; business accounts have stricter rules. Note that while mainland Chinese can link their accounts for cross-border use (e.g., payments in China via AlipayHK), some features like RMB transfers may have limits based on HKMA regulations.

If you're planning a trip, head to a popular spot like Tsim Sha Tsui for a SIM and easy access—many mainland visitors do this successfully.
