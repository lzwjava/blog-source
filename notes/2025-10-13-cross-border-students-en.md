### Who Are "Kuaijing Sheng" (Cross-Border Students)?

"Kuaijing sheng" (跨境生), often translated as cross-border students (CBS), refers to a unique group of around 30,000 children who hold Hong Kong permanent residency but live in Shenzhen, Mainland China, and commute daily across the border to attend primary or secondary schools in Hong Kong. These students are typically born in Hong Kong to Mainland Chinese parents who traveled there for delivery to secure HK citizenship for their child (a practice known as "cross-border birth"). This gives the kids automatic right of abode in HK, including access to free public education.

The families often relocate to Shenzhen for its lower living costs—rent and daily expenses are much cheaper than in HK—while prioritizing HK's higher-quality education system, English-medium instruction, and international opportunities. Most are from middle-class backgrounds, with parents working in Shenzhen's tech or business sectors. The daily commute involves border checkpoints like Futian Port or Lok Ma Chau, taking 15-30 minutes by high-speed rail or bus, though it can be exhausting with early starts and crowds. This phenomenon has grown since the 2000s due to HK's birthright policies (partially restricted in 2013) and the Greater Bay Area's integration.

### How to Arrange Becoming a Cross-Border Student

To set this up, the child must first obtain HK permanent residency, usually via birth in HK (parents need a temporary visit permit). Once that's secured:

1. **School Admission**: As HK residents, kids apply directly to local primary or secondary schools through the Education Bureau's centralized allocation system. They qualify for subsidized places without competing as non-locals.

2. **Border Crossing Permissions**: The child gets a HK ID card and applies for an Exit-Entry Permit for Hong Kong and Macao (EEP, or "回乡证" in Chinese) from Mainland authorities. This allows unlimited daily crossings. Parents, if non-HK residents, use their own travel permits but don't need student-specific visas.

3. **Daily Logistics**: Families live in Shenzhen (e.g., near border areas like Futian or Longgang districts) and use student-designated coaches or MTR lines. Schools often provide shuttle services. Costs include transport (around HK$500-1,000/month) and potential tutoring for bilingual needs.

Challenges include long queues (up to 2 hours during peaks), health checks during pandemics, and emotional strain from the "rat race" lifestyle. Recent policies aim to cap numbers and encourage local enrollment in Shenzhen to ease border pressure.

### How Shenzhen or Mainland Chinese Citizens Can Study in Hong Kong

For Shenzhen residents or other Mainland Chinese citizens without HK residency, the process differs by education level—it's harder for school than university, as free public schooling is reserved for HK residents. Non-residents can't easily become daily commuters like kuaijing sheng without residency.

#### For Primary/Secondary School:
- **Eligibility**: Limited spots for non-local students via private international schools (e.g., ESF schools) or direct applications to public ones, but these are fee-paying (HK$50,000-150,000/year) and competitive.
- **Visa**: Apply for a student visa through the Immigration Department (ImmD), sponsored by the school. Submit proof of acceptance, finances, and accommodation.
- **Living Arrangement**: Most live in HK full-time (dorms or family rentals), but Shenzhen residents could commute if approved for multiple-entry permits. Daily crossing requires an EEP and school coordination.
- **Challenges**: High costs and quotas; not as seamless as for residents.

#### For University (Undergraduate/Postgraduate):
- **Application**: Mainland students apply via non-JUPAS (for international quals like IB/A-levels) or Gaokao (national exam) through the Joint Entrance Examination system. Top unis like HKU, CUHK, or HKUST admit ~8,000-10,000 Mainland undergrads yearly, often 75% of non-local intake.
  - Gaokao route: Score well and apply via the National Colleges system; unis set quotas.
  - Non-Gaokao: Submit transcripts, English tests (IELTS/TOEFL), and interviews.
- **Visa**: Student visa (IANG for post-study work) sponsored by the university. Processing takes 4-6 weeks; need proof of funds (HK$200,000+).
- **Living**: Many rent in HK (HK$10,000-20,000/month), but Shenzhen proximity allows commuting via high-speed rail (30-45 mins to Kowloon). Dorms are subsidized for internationals.

Overall, ~75% of HK unis' non-local undergrads are from the Mainland, drawn by global rankings and English programs.

### For Guangzhou Citizens (or Further Afield)
Guangzhou students follow the same university application process as other Mainlanders, but without HK residency, school-level commuting is impractical due to distance (1-2 hours by train to border). To mimic kuaijing sheng:

- **Rent in Shenzhen**: Many do this—affordable apartments near Futian (RMB 3,000-6,000/month) make daily HK commutes feasible for university classes. It's a "Greater Bay Area hack" for lower costs while accessing HK education. For school, families might relocate temporarily or use boarding.
- **Logistics**: Get a multiple-entry EEP; use Lo Wu or Futian ports. Post-2018 border optimizations help, but peaks (e.g., mornings) add time.

This setup leverages the Bay Area's integration, but visas and quotas remain hurdles.
