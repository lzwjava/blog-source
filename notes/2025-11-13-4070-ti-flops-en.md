### FLOPS Calculation for NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti has a peak single-precision (FP32) floating-point performance of approximately 40.1 TFLOPS (teraflops), based on its specifications: 7,680 CUDA cores and a boost clock speed of 2.61 GHz. This is calculated as follows:

- Theoretical peak FP32 FLOPS = (Number of CUDA cores) × (Boost clock in GHz) × 2 (for fused multiply-add operations per cycle).
- So: 7,680 × 2.61 × 2 = 40.09 TFLOPS (rounded to 40.1 TFLOPS).

Assuming 90% utilization non-stop for one year:
- Effective FLOPS rate = 40.1 TFLOPS × 0.9 = 36.09 TFLOPS.
- Convert to operations per second: 36.09 × 10¹² FLOPS.
- Seconds in a year (accounting for leap years): 365.25 days × 24 hours × 3,600 seconds = 31,557,600 seconds.
- Total FLOPs over the year = (36.09 × 10¹²) × 31,557,600 ≈ 1.14 × 10²¹ FLOPs.

To compute this yourself:
1. Start with the peak TFLOPS (40.1).
2. Multiply by utilization (0.9) to get effective TFLOPS.
3. Convert to FLOPS per second by multiplying by 10¹².
4. Multiply by seconds in a year (use 365.25 × 86,400 for precision).
5. The result is the total floating-point operations.

Note that real-world utilization depends on workload, cooling, and power limits, so this is a theoretical estimate. Also, your build lists an RTX 4070 (not Ti), which has a lower peak of about 29.1 TFLOPS—let me know if you meant that instead.

### PC Build Review

Your build looks solid for a high-end gaming or productivity setup, with good compatibility across components. The Intel i9-13900KF (13th gen) pairs well with the B760 motherboard (LGA 1700 socket, supports DDR5). The RTX 4070 is a strong mid-high GPU for 1440p/4K gaming, and the 750W PSU should handle the load (CPU TDP ~125W base, up to 253W turbo; GPU ~200W). Total power draw under load might hit 500-600W, leaving headroom.

A few notes from my research (prices fluctuate, and since the date is 2025, older gen parts like 13th-gen Intel may be cheaper than 2024 figures):
- Your total (~14,000 CNY) seems reasonable for China, though some items like the PSU at 398 CNY feel low—current estimates put similar 750W units around 500-700 CNY.
- The GPU is an RTX 4070, but your query mentioned 4070 Ti. If you're considering upgrading, 4070 Ti models start around 7,000-8,000 CNY historically, but could be lower now (pushing your budget to ~16,000 CNY total).
- Everything else checks out: DDR5 RAM is fast, storage mix is balanced, cooler should tame the i9's heat.
- Minor: The PSU is listed as "CX650F RGB, 750 Watt"—likely a typo for CX750F. Ensure it's 80+ Bronze or better for efficiency.

If this is for gaming, it's overkill but future-proof. For AI/ML (given the FLOPS query), the 4070 Ti would offer ~38% more performance. Let me know if you want alternatives or tweaks!
