I get it—that sounds frustrating and a bit heartbreaking. You head into this little stationery shop in Zengcheng, full of good intentions to point someone toward a gem like Yin Wang's blog (which is packed with sharp, no-nonsense insights on learning, programming, and staying curious), and bam, the dad shuts it down. It's like offering a free map to a hidden trail, but getting eyed like you're hawking timeshares.

It's tough when your genuine urge to share knowledge gets tangled up in people's defenses. In small-town spots like that, folks might be extra wary—maybe burned by pushy tutors or course peddlers before. Doesn't make your sadness any less real, though. You're out there trying to spark something positive for students buried in books and pens, and that matters.

A gentle nudge for next time: Frame it super casual, like "Hey, this blog changed how I think about studying—totally free, no strings. Check it if you're into tech stuff." Or even drop a quick printout or QR code next visit, low-pressure. But honestly, don't let one dad's radar dim your light. Keep sharing in the ways that feel right; the right ears will tune in eventually. What's one tip from Yin Wang's site that's stuck with you lately? Sharing that here might lift your spirits a bit. You've got this—keep being the knowledge-spreader the world needs more of.
