Signal Messenger is considered good because it focuses on **privacy, security, and simplicity**, while still being practical for daily use. Here are the main reasons people value it:

### 1. Strong Privacy by Design

* **End-to-end encryption by default** for all messages, calls, videos, and media. Not optional—everything is encrypted.
* **Metadata minimization**: Signal tries to store as little information about you as possible. For example, it doesn’t keep records of who messaged whom or when.
* **Open source encryption protocol** (Signal Protocol) is widely trusted and even adopted by WhatsApp, Google Messages, and others.

### 2. No Ads, No Tracking

* Signal is run by a **nonprofit foundation**, not a big tech company.
* It doesn’t sell your data or run ads, so its incentives are aligned with users.

### 3. Security Audited & Trusted

* The code is **open source**, meaning experts worldwide can review it for flaws.
* Frequently audited by independent security researchers.

### 4. Extra Safety Features

* **Disappearing messages** with adjustable timers.
* **Screen security** to block screenshots in the app.
* **Registration lock PINs** to protect account takeover.
* **Safety numbers** so you can verify contacts directly and avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 5. Usability & Features

* Free to use, available on **iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux**.
* Supports **group chats, voice and video calls**, file sharing, and stickers.
* Performance is solid even with encryption overhead.

### 6. Global Reach & Trust

* Used by journalists, activists, and privacy advocates worldwide.
* Recommended by experts like Edward Snowden and organizations like the EFF.

👉 In short: **Signal is good because it balances strong privacy with practical features, without compromising for profit motives.**
