In the context of semiconductors like those used in a BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor), **doping** refers to the process of intentionally adding small, controlled amounts of impurity atoms (called dopants) to a pure semiconductor material, such as silicon or germanium. This alters the material's electrical conductivity by introducing extra charge carriers (electrons or holes).

### Key Points:
- **Pure semiconductors** (intrinsic) have limited conductivity because they have roughly equal numbers of electrons (negative charge carriers) and holes (positive charge carriers).
- **Doping creates extrinsic semiconductors** with enhanced conductivity:
  - **N-type doping**: Adding impurities with more valence electrons than silicon (e.g., phosphorus or arsenic, Group V elements). This creates an excess of free electrons, making the material negatively charged overall.
  - **P-type doping**: Adding impurities with fewer valence electrons (e.g., boron or gallium, Group III elements). This creates "holes" (missing electrons) that act as positive charge carriers, making the material positively charged overall.
- In a BJT, the three regions (emitter, base, and collector) are alternately doped to form either an NPN structure (n-p-n) or PNP structure (p-n-p), enabling the two p-n junctions that allow current control and amplification.

Doping levels are precisely controlled during manufacturing to achieve desired performance, typically at concentrations of 10^15 to 10^19 atoms per cubic centimeter in the semiconductor lattice.
