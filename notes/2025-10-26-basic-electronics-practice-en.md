### Practice Questions for Basic Electronic Technology (III) - 04730 (National Self-Study Exam, 610201)

To help you prepare for the exam, I've compiled a set of practice questions based on past papers. This is a partial extraction from the April 2021 national exam, translated to English for clarity. The exam typically includes 15 single-choice questions (1 point each), 15 fill-in-the-blank questions (1 point each), short-answer questions, calculation problems, and design/analysis questions. Topics cover circuit analysis, semiconductors, amplifiers, operational amplifiers, power supplies, and digital logic.

Focus on understanding concepts like resonance, transistor biasing, op-amp circuits, rectification, and logic gates. Practice calculations and circuit analysis.

### Tips for Preparation
- **Review Key Topics**: Sinusoidal signals, passive networks, semiconductors (diodes/transistors), BJT amplifiers (common-emitter, emitter-follower), op-amps (inverting/non-inverting, integrators), rectifiers/filters, voltage regulators, digital logic (gates, flip-flops, counters, decoders).
- **Practice Calculations**: Use Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's laws, resonance formulas (\\( f = 1/(2\pi\sqrt{LC}) \\)), transistor equations (\\( I_c = \beta I_b \\)), op-amp gains (\\( A = -R_f/R_{in} \\)).
- **Exam Structure**: 100 points total, 150 minutes. Aim for 60% to pass.
- For full past papers and answers, download from reliable self-exam sites (often in PDF). Practice under timed conditions.
