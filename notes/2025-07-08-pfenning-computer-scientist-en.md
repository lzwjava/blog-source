Frank Pfenning is a distinguished German-American computer scientist, currently serving as a Joseph F. Traub Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He held the position of head of the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University from 2013 to 2018.

Pfenning's academic journey began with studies in mathematics and computer science at Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany. He then moved to Carnegie Mellon University on a Fulbright Scholarship, where he earned his Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1987.

His research interests are broad and significant, primarily focusing on the applications of mathematical logic in computer science. Key areas of his work include:

* **Programming Languages:** He has concentrated on extending the expressive power of type systems to allow more properties of programs to be checked statically.
* **Logic and Type Theory:** This forms the core of much of his research, including work on refinement types, dependent types, and modal types.
* **Logical Frameworks:** He is one of the principal authors of the Twelf system, a meta-logical framework for deductive systems that supports specification, implementation, and formal reasoning about programming languages and logics.
* **Automated Deduction:** His contributions in this area have been recognized with the ACM Fellow award in 2015 "for contributions to the logical foundations of automatic theorem proving and types for programming languages."
* **Trustworthy Computing.**

Beyond his research, Pfenning has also significantly impacted computer science education. He developed Carnegie Mellon's introductory imperative programming course for undergraduates and the C0 programming language used in this course. He has also advised numerous Ph.D. students and held various leadership roles within Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, including Director of Graduate Programs and Associate Dean for Graduate Education.

His influence is evident in his many publications, and he has received several accolades, including the LICS Test of Time Award for his paper "A Linear Logical Framework" (co-authored with Iliano Cervesato) and the Herbert A. Simon Award for Teaching Excellence. He has also served on various editorial boards, conference committees, and advisory boards for international professional organizations.
