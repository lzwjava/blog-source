Learning in your 30s may not feel easier than in your 20s, despite a decade more experience, due to several factors:

1. **Neuroplasticity Decline**: The brain's plasticity, or ability to form new neural connections, peaks in youth and gradually declines with age. While still adaptable in your 30s, the brain requires more effort to rewire itself for new skills or knowledge compared to your 20s.

2. **Cognitive Load and Responsibilities**: By your 30s, life often involves more responsibilities—career demands, family, finances—which compete for mental energy. This can reduce focus and make learning feel harder than in your 20s, when you likely had fewer obligations.

3. **Learning Style and Habits**: Over 10 years, you may have developed rigid learning habits or relied on familiar methods from work or reading. These may not be as effective for new types of learning, and adapting to new approaches can feel challenging.

4. **Confidence and Risk Aversion**: In your 20s, you’re often more open to trial and error. By your 30s, self-expectations or fear of failure can make learning new things feel more daunting, even with experience.

5. **Time and Practice**: While 10 years of reading or work builds expertise, it may not translate to learning unrelated skills. Specific, deliberate practice is needed for new domains, and time constraints in your 30s can limit this.

That said, your 30s bring advantages—like better discipline, problem-solving skills, and contextual understanding—that can make learning more effective if you manage stress and prioritize practice. It’s not necessarily harder, just different due to life’s complexities.
