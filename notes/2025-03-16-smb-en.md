Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up an SMB (Server Message Block) server on Ubuntu to serve media files. SMB is a protocol that allows you to share files across a network, making it ideal for serving media to devices like computers, TVs, or mobile devices. We’ll use Samba, the software that provides SMB functionality on Linux, and configure it to share a directory containing your media files.

---

### Step 1: Install Samba
First, you need to install Samba on your Ubuntu system. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba
```

- `sudo apt update` refreshes the package list to ensure you get the latest version.
- `sudo apt install samba` installs the Samba package, which includes the necessary tools and services.

---

### Step 2: Back Up the Samba Configuration File
Before making changes, it’s a good practice to back up the default Samba configuration file. Run:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.backup
```

This creates a copy of the original file (`smb.conf.backup`) in case you need to revert changes later.

---

### Step 3: Configure the Media Share
The Samba configuration file is located at `/etc/samba/smb.conf`. You’ll edit this file to define a share for your media files. For this example, assume your media files are stored in `/home/user/media` (replace `user` with your actual username).

1. Open the configuration file in a text editor, such as `nano`:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
   ```

2. Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following section:
   ```ini
   [media]
       path = /home/user/media
       browseable = yes
       read only = yes
       guest ok = yes
   ```

3. Save and exit:
   - In `nano`, press `Ctrl+O`, then `Enter` to save, and `Ctrl+X` to exit.

#### Explanation of the Configuration:
- `[media]`: The name of the share, visible to users browsing the network.
- `path = /home/user/media`: The directory you want to share (adjust this to match your media folder’s location).
- `browseable = yes`: Makes the share visible when browsing the network.
- `read only = yes`: Prevents users from modifying or deleting files (ideal for media serving).
- `guest ok = yes`: Allows access without a username or password, keeping it simple for media access.

---

### Step 4: Verify the Configuration
To ensure there are no syntax errors in your configuration, run:

```bash
testparm
```

This command checks the `smb.conf` file and displays the loaded services. If there are no errors, you’re good to proceed.

---

### Step 5: Restart Samba Services
Samba runs two services: `smbd` (handles file sharing) and `nmbd` (handles network discovery). Restart them to apply your changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
sudo systemctl restart nmbd
```

To ensure these services start automatically on boot (usually enabled by default), you can run:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable smbd
sudo systemctl enable nmbd
```

---

### Step 6: Adjust File Permissions
For guest access to work, the media directory and its files must be readable by everyone. Set the appropriate permissions with:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /home/user/media
```

- `755` means the owner has full permissions (read, write, execute), while others have read and execute permissions (needed to access and list files).
- `-R` applies the change recursively to all files and subdirectories.

---

### Step 7: Configure the Firewall
If Ubuntu’s firewall (UFW) is active, you need to allow SMB traffic. First, check the firewall status:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

If it’s active, open the necessary ports:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 139/tcp
sudo ufw allow 445/tcp
sudo ufw allow 137/udp
sudo ufw allow 138/udp
```

- Ports 139 and 445 (TCP) are used for SMB file sharing.
- Ports 137 and 138 (UDP) are used by `nmbd` for network discovery.

Reload the firewall to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo ufw reload
```

If the firewall is inactive, you can skip this step.

---

### Step 8: Test the SMB Share
Your SMB server should now be running. To test it:

1. Find your Ubuntu machine’s IP address:
   ```bash
   ip addr show
   ```
   Look for the IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) under your network interface (like `eth0` or `wlan0`).

2. From another device on the network (e.g., a Windows PC):
   - Open File Explorer and enter: `\\<ubuntu-ip-address>\media` (e.g., `\\192.168.1.100\media`).
   - You should see your media files. Since guest access is enabled, no login is required.

---

### Troubleshooting Tips
If you encounter issues:
- **Check Samba Logs**: Logs are located in `/var/log/samba/` (e.g., `log.smbd` or `log.nmbd`). Use `cat` or `tail` to view them:
  ```bash
  sudo tail -f /var/log/samba/log.smbd
  ```
- **Test Locally**: Use `smbclient` to list shares on your Ubuntu machine:
  ```bash
  smbclient -L localhost
  ```
  Or connect to the share:
  ```bash
  smbclient //localhost/media -N
  ```
  (`-N` skips the password prompt for guest access.)

---

### Summary of Commands
Here’s the complete sequence:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba
sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.backup
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf  # Add the [media] section
testparm
sudo systemctl restart smbd
sudo systemctl restart nmbd
sudo chmod -R 755 /home/user/media
sudo ufw allow 139/tcp
sudo ufw allow 445/tcp
sudo ufw allow 137/udp
sudo ufw allow 138/udp
sudo ufw reload
```

Your SMB server is now set up to serve media files from `/home/user/media`! Access it from any device on your network using the IP address and share name (`\\<ip-address>\media`).
