Based on the most recent available data from GitHub's Octoverse reports, the number of workflow jobs run in GitHub Actions has grown significantly over the years, driven by increasing developer adoption and automation needs.

In 2022 (the last year with explicit reporting on job counts), GitHub Actions ran approximately 263 million workflow jobs per month. This translates to:
- About 8.77 million jobs per day (263 million / 30 days).
- About 365,000 jobs per hour (8.77 million / 24 hours).

Since then, overall usage has increased substantially. GitHub Actions minutes (a proxy for activity) grew from 7.3 billion in 2023 to 10.54 billion in 2024, a 30% year-over-year increase. Developer count on GitHub also rose from around 94 million in 2022 to over 150 million by mid-2025. Assuming similar growth in job volume, the daily figure as of 2025 is likely in the tens of millions (e.g., 10-15 million per day), and hourly in the hundreds of thousands to low millions (e.g., 400,000-600,000 per hour).

These are estimates for total global usage across all repositories (public and private). Exact 2025 figures aren't publicly available, but trends indicate it's in the tens of millions per day.
