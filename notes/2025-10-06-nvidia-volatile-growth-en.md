### NVIDIA's Performance from 2000 to 2010

NVIDIA (assuming "NVIIDA" refers to NVIDIA) experienced significant volatility during the 2000-2010 period, marked by the dot-com bust, recovery in gaming and graphics tech, and early forays into parallel computing. The company navigated a major crash in 2002 but rebounded strongly, driven by hits like the GeForce series and the launch of CUDA in 2006, which expanded GPUs beyond graphics into general-purpose computing. Financially, revenue grew from about $374 million in 2000 to $3.33 billion in 2010, despite setbacks like a $200 million write-down in 2008 due to manufacturing defects in mobile chips.

Stock performance was erratic but ultimately positive, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 15-20% over the decade (adjusted for splits). Here's a year-by-year breakdown of annual total returns:

| Year | Return (%) |
|------|------------|
| 2000 | +39.61    |
| 2001 | +308.36   |
| 2002 | -82.80    |
| 2003 | +101.56   |
| 2004 | +1.55     |
| 2005 | +55.18    |
| 2006 | +102.46   |
| 2007 | +37.88    |
| 2008 | -76.28    |
| 2009 | +131.47   |
| 2010 | -17.56    |

Key highlights:
- **Boom and bust (2000-2002)**: Explosive growth in 2001 from GeForce 2 launches, but the 2002 crash wiped out gains amid the broader tech downturn.
- **Recovery (2003-2007)**: Strong rebounds fueled by Xbox partnerships, multiple acquisitions (e.g., 3dfx in 2002, MediaQ in 2003), and S&P 500 inclusion in 2001. Forbes named NVIDIA "Company of the Year" in 2007.
- **Challenges and pivot (2008-2010)**: Global financial crisis hit hard in 2008, but 2009's surge came from CUDA adoption in scientific computing. By 2010, NVIDIA settled a lawsuit over defective chips and inked a $1.5 billion deal with Intel.

Overall, a $1,000 investment at the start of 2000 would have grown to about $2,500-$3,000 by end-2010, adjusted for splits.

### Jensen Huang's Growth During This Period

Jensen Huang, NVIDIA's co-founder and CEO since 1993, solidified his role as a visionary leader during 2000-2010. Entering the decade as a battle-tested exec post-IPO (1999), he steered the company through near-collapse in the dot-com era, emphasizing relentless innovation in GPUs. Key aspects of his growth:
- **Strategic pivots**: Huang championed acquisitions like 3dfx (2000-2002) to dominate 3D graphics and bet big on mobile/embedded tech (e.g., PortalPlayer in 2007). He launched CUDA in 2006, foreseeing GPUs' role in AI and HPC— a move that positioned NVIDIA for future dominance.
- **Recognition and compensation**: By mid-decade, Huang was among the highest-paid CEOs (peaking at $23.5 million in 2007 salary/bonuses), reflecting NVIDIA's turnaround. Forbes highlighted his leadership in 2007.
- **Personal evolution**: From a hands-on engineer (early jobs at AMD/LSI), Huang became a industry icon, often credited with NVIDIA's survival odds (he once said "0% chance" at founding). By 2010, his net worth tied to NVIDIA stock exceeded $1 billion, and he was building a culture of "first principles" thinking.

Huang's tenure saw NVIDIA's market cap rise from ~$5 billion in 2000 to ~$7 billion in 2010, laying groundwork for explosive AI growth later.

### Team Growth from 2000 to 2010

NVIDIA's workforce expanded steadily, reflecting its shift from a niche graphics startup to a broader tech player. Employee count roughly quintupled, fueled by acquisitions, R&D in GPUs/CUDA, and global offices. Approximate annual figures (based on fiscal year-end reports):

| Year | Employees (approx.) | Growth Notes |
|------|---------------------|--------------|
| 2000 | 400                | Post-IPO hiring for GeForce ramp-up. |
| 2003 | 1,510              | Recovery hiring after 2002 layoffs. |
| 2004 | 1,830              | +21% YoY; MediaQ acquisition adds mobile talent. |
| 2005 | 2,100              | +15% YoY; Focus on chipsets and southbridge tech. |
| 2009 | 3,772              | Steady amid recession; CUDA teams grow. |
| 2010 | 5,706              | +51% YoY; Post-crisis expansion, Tegra mobile push. |

From ~400 in 2000 to over 5,700 in 2010, growth averaged 30-40% annually in boom years, with dips during downturns. This built a diverse team (e.g., ~58% male in 2005 reports), emphasizing engineering talent for innovations like PhysX integration (Ageia acquisition, 2008).
