### Top Hospital in Guangzhou

Based on recent 2025 rankings and evaluations from sources like Scimago Institutions Rankings, national hospital assessments, and specialized lists, the **First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (中山大学附属第一医院)** stands out as the top overall hospital in Guangzhou. Established in 1910, it's a Grade 3A facility (the highest level in China) and the largest comprehensive hospital in the city, with over 2,500 beds. It excels in general medicine, surgery, cardiology, oncology, and more, often ranking in the top 5-10 nationally (e.g., #6 in China per Fudan University Hospital Management rankings and around #29 in Scimago's 2025 health sector list). It's particularly renowned for its international medical department, advanced research, and treatment of complex cases.

#### Other Notable Top Hospitals in Guangzhou
For context, here are a few other highly ranked ones based on national and regional evaluations:
- **Nanfang Hospital (Southern Medical University)**: Ranked ~#35 nationally (Scimago 2025); strong in gastroenterology, orthopedics, and emergency care.
- **Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University**: A++ grade in China's 2023 national top 100 list; excels in hepatology, neurology, and infectious diseases.
- **Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center**: #2 nationally for oncology; a WHO Collaborating Center focused on cancer treatment and research.
- **Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital**: ~#42 nationally; top for cardiology and respiratory medicine.

Rankings can vary by specialty (e.g., Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center is #1 for eye care), so the "top" depends on needs. For expats, options like Guangzhou United Family Hospital offer English-speaking services.
