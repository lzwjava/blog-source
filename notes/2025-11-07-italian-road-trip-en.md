### Two-Week Road Trip Itinerary in Italy: Highlights and Planning Guide

Italy is a dream for road trips, with its mix of ancient ruins, Renaissance art, coastal cliffs, and rolling vineyards. This 14-day itinerary focuses on a classic loop starting and ending in major hubs (fly into Rome, out of Venice), covering iconic tourist spots like Rome's Colosseum, Florence's Uffizi Gallery, Venice's canals, the dramatic Amalfi Coast, hiking trails in Cinque Terre, and wine country in Tuscany. It's designed for 2-4 people, assuming a rental car for flexibility in scenic rural areas while using trains or short drives in congested cities to avoid stress.

Total driving: About 800-1,000 km (500-620 miles), spread out to prevent fatigue. Expect 4-6 hours of driving on transition days, with easy highways (autostrade) and winding coastal roads. Budget €1,500-2,500 per person (excluding flights), covering car rental (€400-600 one-way), fuel/tolls (€200-300), mid-range hotels (€100-150/night), meals (€50-80/day), and entry fees (€200-300 total).
