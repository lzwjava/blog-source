### Definition of "Revelation"

**Noun**:  
1. **A surprising and previously unknown fact**: Something that is disclosed or revealed, often unexpectedly, that changes one's understanding or perspective.  
   *Example*: "The scientist's discovery was a revelation in the field of biology."

2. **The act of revealing or disclosing something**: The process of making something known that was previously secret or hidden.  
   *Example*: "The revelation of the truth shocked everyone."

3. **Religious context**: In Christianity and other faiths, a divine disclosure or communication from God, as in the Bible's *Book of Revelation* (also called the Apocalypse), which prophesies the end times.

The word originates from the Latin *revelatio*, meaning "unveiling" or "disclosure," from *revelare* ("to unveil").
