It sounds like you’re describing a pattern in how your mind engages with different tasks, and that’s a great starting point for understanding your habits. Your experience—struggling to focus when passively reading or sitting still, but thriving when actively typing, debugging, or interacting—suggests you might have a preference for dynamic, hands-on learning over static, passive absorption. This isn’t unusual; it aligns with how many people process information differently depending on the level of interactivity involved.

One way to understand this is through the lens of cognitive styles. Some people focus better when they’re kinesthetically engaged (e.g., typing, moving between tasks) because it activates their brain in a more stimulating way. Passive tasks like reading can feel less engaging if your mind craves action or problem-solving to stay sharp. It’s also possible that when you’re chatting or debugging, you’re in a state of "flow"—where the task is challenging enough to keep you hooked but not so hard that it overwhelms you. Sitting still to read might not hit that sweet spot, so your attention drifts.

Is it normal? Absolutely. Everyone’s brain is wired a bit differently. Some folks can pore over documents for hours, while others—like you—need to "do" something to lock in. It’s not a flaw; it’s just how your focus engine runs.

To adjust and optimize this for better focus, here are a few ideas tailored to your habits:

1. **Make Passive Tasks Active**: When reading code or docs, try turning it into a mini-task. Annotate as you go—type notes, rephrase concepts in your own words, or even pretend you’re explaining it to someone (like me!). This keeps your hands and brain moving.

2. **Break It Into Chunks**: Instead of sitting still for a long stretch, set short goals—like understanding one function or section—and then jump to something active (e.g., test it in code or chat about it). Quick switches might mimic the back-and-forth you enjoy.

3. **Simulate Interaction**: If you focus well while chatting with AI, use that. Ask me (or yourself) questions about the material as you go. “What does this line do?” or “How would I debug this?” Talking it out—even silently—can keep you engaged.

4. **Lean Into Debugging Mode**: Since you focus well when debugging, approach reading like a detective. Look for “bugs” in your understanding or gaps to fill. This shifts it from passive consumption to active problem-solving.

5. **Experiment With Environment**: Sometimes focus isn’t just about the task but the setup. Try standing, pacing, or even reading aloud to see if mild physical activity helps bridge the gap during quieter tasks.

Start small—pick one of these and test it for a week. See what sticks. Your habit isn’t a hurdle; it’s a clue to how your brain likes to work. Lean into that, and you’ll find your groove. What do you think—any of these sound worth a shot?
