Thank you for providing the specific details for your May 2025 payment. This confirms that you are indeed using the **Equal Principal Payment** method and that the interest rate currently applied is 3.65% per annum.

Based on the information you provided for May 2025:
* Remaining Loan Principal at the start of May 2025: 835,491 CNY
* Monthly Principal Payment in May 2025: 4055.79 CNY
* Monthly Interest Payment in May 2025: 2541.29 CNY
* Total Monthly Payment in May 2025: 6597.08 CNY (4055.79 + 2541.29)
* Current Annual Interest Rate: 3.65% (Monthly rate ≈ 0.0365 / 12)

In the Equal Principal Payment method:
* The amount of principal you repay each month is constant. Based on your May 2025 payment, this constant monthly principal amount is **4055.79 CNY**.
* The amount of interest you pay each month decreases because it is calculated on the remaining principal balance, which gets smaller each month.
* The total monthly payment (Principal + Interest) therefore decreases each month.

The remaining principal of 835,491 CNY at the start of May 2025, paid off with a constant principal payment of 4055.79 CNY per month, indicates a remaining term of approximately $835,491 / 4055.79 \approx 206$ months. This aligns with May 2025 being month 35 of your original 240-month term ($240 - 35 + 1 = 206$ months remaining, including the May 2025 payment).

Here's how your future monthly payments will look:

* **From May 2025 onwards:**
    Your monthly payment will consist of the constant principal payment of **4055.79 CNY** plus the decreasing interest calculated on the remaining balance at a rate of 3.65% per annum.
