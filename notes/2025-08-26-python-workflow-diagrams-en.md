If you're looking for Python libraries that make it easy to draw workflows or flow graphs—think tools like **maniod** that simplify diagramming—here's a selection of excellent options worth exploring:

### Recommended Python Packages for Workflows & Flow Diagrams

#### **1. Graphviz (via Python)**

* A widely-used open-source tool for drawing graphs defined in DOT language.
* Offers multiple layout styles like layered (`dot`), circular (`circo`), radial (`twopi`), and force-directed (`neato`, `fdp`) ([Wikipedia][1]).
* In Python, you can use the `graphviz` or `pygraphviz` wrapper to define nodes and edges programmatically—DSL-style.

> “I’ve used GraphViz for things like this. The main reason I like it is because it’s more of a DSL than a GUI for making flow charts.” ([Reddit][2])

#### **2. NetworkX**

* A Python-native library for graph creation, analysis, and visualization via Matplotlib or Graphviz layouts ([Wikipedia][3]).
* Supports directed graphs, multi-edges, and various layout algorithms like spring-layout, multipartite (great for layered workflows), circular layouts, etc. ([Wikipedia][3]).
* Perfect for generating data-driven workflow diagrams where graph structure is dynamic.

#### **3. Pyvis (with VisJS)**

* Lets you build interactive workflow visualizations in notebooks or the web using Python.
* Built on VisJS; highly customizable interactivity, layout physics, tooltips—responsive and user-friendly for exploratory diagrams ([GitHub][4], [arXiv][5]).

#### **4. Graph-tool**

* A high-performance Python/C++ library for graph manipulation & visualization.
* Offers nice exports via Cairo or Graphviz and supports complex graph algorithms if you need analytic plus visual capabilities ([Wikipedia][6]).

#### **5. igraph**

* A fast, scalable graph library (C core with Python interface).
* Great for performance-heavy workloads and large-scale graphs with interactive plotting support ([arXiv][7]).

#### **6. pyflowsheet**

* Tailored for **process flow diagrams** in engineering contexts.
* Lets you generate flowsheets from code—minimal fuss, ideal for process engineers ([GitHub][4]).

#### **7. Plotly Sankey Diagram**

* For representing flows with quantitative quantities—Sankey diagrams show flow volume using arrow widths.
* Useful when you need to show not just structure but also magnitude of flows between steps ([Plotly][8]).

### Other Tools Mentioned

* **Schemdraw**: Tailored for circuit schematics but has a flowcharting module. Gorgeous diagrams, but layout must be manually specified ([Stack Overflow][9]).
* **VisTrails**: A UI-based scientific workflow tool (not actively maintained) for managing, visualizing, and exploring pipelines visually ([Wikipedia][10]).
* **PM4Py**: Focused on **process mining** rather than drawing arbitrary workflows. More about analyzing event logs ([arXiv][11]).

Here’s a quick breakdown to help you choose:

* **Want DSL-like, static flowcharts?** → **Graphviz**
* **Need dynamic/custom graph structures?** → **NetworkX** (+ Matplotlib or Graphviz)
* **Want interactivity in notebooks/web?** → **Pyvis**
* **Working with big, performance-sensitive graphs?** → **igraph** or **graph-tool**
* **Need engineering-style flowsheets from code?** → **pyflowsheet**
* **Representing quantitative flow between stages?** → **Plotly Sankey**

### Example Snippets

**Graphviz (Python)**

```python
from graphviz import Digraph

dot = Digraph()
dot.node('A', 'Start')
dot.node('B', 'Process')
dot.node('C', 'End')
dot.edge('A', 'B')
dot.edge('B', 'C')

dot.render('flowchart', view=True)
```

**NetworkX**

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

G = nx.DiGraph()
G.add_edge('A', 'B')
G.add_edge('B', 'C')

pos = nx.multipartite_layout(G, subset_key=lambda n: {'A':0,'B':1,'C':2}[n])
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, arrows=True)
plt.show()
```

**Plotly Sankey**

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(go.Sankey(
    node = dict(label=["Start","Process","End"], pad=15, thickness=20),
    link = dict(source=[0,1], target=[1,2], value=[1,1])
))
fig.show()
```

---

### TL;DR

* **Graphviz** for clean, DSL/ code-defined workflows.
* **NetworkX** for flexible, layout-driven diagrams via Python.
* **Pyvis** for interactive, rich visualizations in notebooks or web.
* **igraph** / **graph-tool** for performance-heavy graph tasks.
* **pyflowsheet** for process flowsheets.
* **Plotly Sankey** if you need flow magnitude visuals.
