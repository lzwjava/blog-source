The course **Computer Networks Technology** (likely coded as 02141 or similar in the Chinese Self-Study Exam system) is a technical subject commonly offered in computer science or related majors under the Higher Education Self-Study Examination (自考) in China, including Guangdong Province. While I don’t have direct access to the exact 2025 Guangdong syllabus for course code 02141, I can provide a general outline based on standard content for such a course in the self-study exam framework, informed by typical computer networking curricula and the structure of similar courses in China’s self-study system.

Below is an estimated outline for **Computer Networks Technology (02141)**, tailored to what is typically expected in Guangdong’s self-study exams for a computer-related major (e.g., 610201 or a similar program):

### Course Outline: Computer Networks Technology (02141)
#### Course Objective
This course aims to equip students with foundational knowledge and practical skills in computer networking, focusing on the principles, technologies, and applications of network systems. It prepares students for designing, implementing, and managing basic network infrastructures.

#### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of computer systems (e.g., Computer Organization and Architecture).
- Familiarity with fundamental mathematics (e.g., Linear Algebra may be helpful for network algorithms).

#### Course Content
1. **Introduction to Computer Networks**  
   - Definition and scope of computer networks.  
   - Network classifications (LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN).  
   - Network topologies (star, bus, ring, mesh).  
   - Overview of network applications and their importance.

2. **Network Architecture and Models**  
   - OSI Reference Model (7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application).  
   - TCP/IP Protocol Suite (4 layers: Link, Internet, Transport, Application).  
   - Comparison of OSI and TCP/IP models.  
   - Layered architecture functions and responsibilities.

3. **Physical Layer**  
   - Transmission media (wired: twisted pair, coaxial, fiber optic; wireless: radio, microwave).  
   - Signal encoding techniques (analog vs. digital).  
   - Data transmission basics (bandwidth, throughput, noise).  
   - Hardware components (hubs, repeaters, cables).

4. **Data Link Layer**  
   - Functions: framing, error detection/correction, flow control.  
   - Protocols: Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol).  
   - Medium Access Control (MAC) methods (CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA).  
   - Switching techniques (circuit, packet, message switching).  
   - Introduction to LAN technologies.

5. **Network Layer**  
   - Functions: logical addressing, routing, forwarding.  
   - IP addressing (IPv4 and IPv6 structure, subnetting).  
   - Routing algorithms (static vs. dynamic, distance vector, link state).  
   - Protocols: IP, ICMP, ARP.  
   - Network devices (routers, gateways).

6. **Transport Layer**  
   - Functions: end-to-end communication, reliability, congestion control.  
   - Protocols: TCP (connection-oriented), UDP (connectionless).  
   - Port numbers and multiplexing.  
   - Flow and error control mechanisms.

7. **Application Layer**  
   - Common protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SNMP.  
   - Client-server and peer-to-peer models.  
   - Network services (email, web browsing, file transfer).  
   - Introduction to network security basics (e.g., encryption, authentication).

8. **Network Performance and Management**  
   - Metrics: latency, bandwidth, jitter, packet loss.  
   - Network troubleshooting tools (ping, traceroute).  
   - Basics of network configuration and management.  
   - Quality of Service (QoS) concepts.

9. **Emerging Technologies (Optional/Advanced Topics)**  
   - Wireless networks (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks).  
   - Network virtualization and cloud computing basics.  
   - Introduction to Software-Defined Networking (SDN).  
   - IoT (Internet of Things) and its networking requirements.

#### Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
- Explain the fundamental concepts and architectures of computer networks.
- Describe the functions and protocols of each network layer.
- Configure basic network setups and troubleshoot common issues.
- Understand key networking hardware and software components.
- Apply networking principles to real-world scenarios.

#### Assessment (Typical for Self-Study Exam)
- **Format**: Written examination (closed-book, multiple-choice, and short-answer questions).  
- **Duration**: Approximately 2-3 hours.  
- **Weight**: Likely 100% of the course grade (self-study exams typically rely on a single final exam).  
- **Passing Score**: 60/100 (standard passing threshold in China’s self-study system).  
- **Content Distribution**: Questions may cover theoretical concepts (60-70%) and practical applications (30-40%).

#### Recommended Study Materials
- **Textbook**: A standard reference like *Computer Networks* by Tanenbaum or *Data Communications and Networking* by Forouzan (Chinese editions are widely used in self-study exams).  
- **Supplementary Resources**: Guangdong-specific self-study guides (e.g., published by Higher Education Press or local exam authorities), past exam papers, and online tutorials.  
- **Practice**: Hands-on exercises with network simulation tools (e.g., Packet Tracer) if available.

### Notes on Guangdong Context
- **Course Code 02141**: While I’ve assumed 02141 aligns with "Computer Networks Technology," the exact code might differ slightly in Guangdong’s 2025 catalog. Codes in the 02XXX series are common for foundational technology courses, but some regions use 04XXX (e.g., 04735) for networking. Verification is key.
- **Major 610201**: If tied to a program like "Computer Application Technology," this course would be a core subject, emphasizing practical skills alongside theory.
- **Guangdong Specificity**: Guangdong, as a tech hub (e.g., home to companies like Huawei), may emphasize modern networking trends (e.g., wireless, IoT), though self-study exams tend to focus on standardized national content.

### Recommendation
For the precise outline and confirmation of code 02141, consult the **Guangdong Education Examination Institute** (e.g., via their official website or hotline) or the self-study exam office for major 610201. They provide detailed syllabi and textbooks specific to each course. Would you like me to search further for Guangdong-specific resources?
