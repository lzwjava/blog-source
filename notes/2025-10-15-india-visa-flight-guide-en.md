### Visa Requirements
As a traveler from China (assuming based on your location in Guangzhou), you'll need a visa to enter India. Chinese citizens are eligible for an **e-Tourist Visa (e-TV)**, which is the easiest option for tourism. Key details:
- **Validity**: Up to 5 years with multiple entries (from October 2019 policy).
- **Duration per stay**: Up to 180 days.
- **Application**: Apply online via the official Government of India website (indianvisaonline.gov.in). Processing typically takes 2-4 days.
- **Requirements**: Passport valid for at least 6 months from arrival, two blank pages, recent photo, and proof of onward travel. Fee is around $25-80 USD depending on validity.
- **Alternative**: If e-visa isn't suitable, apply for a paper tourist visa (3 months single entry) through BLS International Services in China (centers in Beijing, etc.), but e-visa is recommended for speed.
Since you're in Guangzhou, check the Consulate General of India there for any local guidance.

Apply well in advance—aim for 1-2 weeks before travel.

### Flight Options
There are **no direct flights** from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (CAN) to Goa Dabolim Airport (GOI) or Manohar International Airport (MOPA). Expect 1-2 stops, with total travel time of 10-20 hours. Common routes go via Mumbai (BOM), Delhi (DEL), Bangkok (BKK), or Singapore (SIN).
