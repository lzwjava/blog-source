### Overview of Meshy.ai
Meshy.ai is a leading AI-powered platform for 3D content creation, specializing in generative tools that let users turn text prompts, images, or sketches into high-quality 3D models, textures, animations, and even videos in seconds. No prior 3D expertise is needed—it's designed for creators in gaming, film, product design, education, VR/AR, and 3D printing. Key features include text-to-3D generation, AI texturing with PBR maps, automatic rigging for characters, and integrations with tools like Unity, Blender, Unreal Engine, and more. It's multilingual, supports enterprise teams with SSO and compliance (e.g., GDPR, SOC2), and boasts a vibrant community where users share and remix models.

The platform has gained traction as one of the most intuitive free AI 3D generators, powering workflows for major players like Meta's Horizon, Supercell, Square Enix, Niantic, and Stanford University. Recent updates, like Meshy-4 (launched in September 2024), have pushed boundaries with faster generation (up to 8 models in 60 seconds), better rigging for bipeds/quadrupeds, and sci-fi-level detail in models.

### The $15 Million Announcement
You're spot on about the buzz from founder Ethan (Yuanming) Hu's recent LinkedIn post (from about 19 hours ago as of November 9, 2025). He announced that Meshy.ai has hit **$15 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**—a huge milestone, but it's revenue, not a new funding round. (For context, the company has raised a total of $52 million from top VCs like Sequoia and GGV Capital to date.) Hu highlighted this as a reflection of explosive user adoption and product-market fit in the 3D AI space.

### Recent Year Growth (2024–2025)
Meshy.ai has been on a tear, showing hyper-growth in a competitive AI landscape. Here's a quick breakdown based on public metrics:

- **Revenue Surge**: 18x growth over the past 12 months (ending November 2025), with ongoing 30% month-over-month (MoM) increases. Hitting $15M ARR puts it in elite company for AI startups focused on creative tools.
  
- **User and Asset Generation**: Over 3 million creators worldwide, who've generated more than 20 million 3D assets in 2024 alone. The community is active, with features like model sharing driving viral adoption.

- **Product Milestones**: 
  - Meshy-4 launch in September 2024, which VentureBeat called "sci-fi level" for its multimodal AI advancements.
  - New fellowship program in late 2024, distributing $60K in grants to 20+ researchers in 3D AI and graphics (winners get $10K prizes plus premium subscriptions).
  - Partnerships ramping up: Integrated with Gaxos.ai for game devs (July 2024) and featured as the *only* 3D AI tool in a16z's 2024 AI Tools Survey.

- **Market Context**: The broader generative AI market (including 3D) is projected to hit $1.3 trillion by 2030 at a 42% CAGR, and Meshy's focus on accessible 3D tools positions it well amid trends like AI in game dev (e.g., 2025 surveys show studios adopting it for faster prototyping).

Overall, Meshy.ai looks incredibly healthy—scaling fast, innovating aggressively, and building a moat in 3D GenAI. If you're a creator or dev, it's worth testing the free tier. Excited to see where they go next!
