### Understanding Your Query
It looks like you're asking about using CoinUnit.io (a Bitcoin ATM service) to "charge" or deposit BTC, selecting the appropriate network, and then sending (withdrawing) that BTC to your Binance account—specifically, whether to choose the standard "Bitcoin" network or "BTC SegWit" on Binance. I'll break this down step-by-step based on how these services work, to help you avoid any risks like lost funds.

### Step 1: "Charging" BTC on CoinUnit.io
- CoinUnit.io operates Bitcoin ATMs where you can **buy BTC by depositing cash** (this is what "charge" likely means in this context—topping up your wallet with BTC).
- The process is straightforward at their ATMs (locations mainly in Hong Kong, with some international spots):
  1. Locate an ATM via their site or app.
  2. Select "Buy Bitcoin."
  3. Scan your Bitcoin wallet QR code (use a mobile wallet like Electrum, Trust Wallet, or Binance's own wallet app).
  4. Insert cash (supports various denominations; fees are typically 5-10%, check on-site).
  5. The ATM sends the BTC directly to **your wallet's Bitcoin address**.
- **Important**: CoinUnit.io ATMs send BTC exclusively on the **native Bitcoin blockchain**. There's no "network choice" here like on exchanges—it's always the standard BTC network. Your wallet receives it as a standard Bitcoin transaction (compatible with all address types: Legacy starting with "1", P2SH-SegWit with "3", or Native SegWit with "bc1").
- No guides on their site for sending to Binance, but once you have the BTC in your wallet, you can transfer it out.

If you meant selling BTC for cash on their ATMs, that's the reverse ("Sell Bitcoin" option), but your query seems focused on acquiring and sending to Binance.

### Step 2: Sending BTC from Your Wallet to Binance
- After buying on CoinUnit.io, you'll have BTC in your personal wallet. To transfer it to Binance:
  1. Log into Binance > Wallet > Deposit > Select "BTC" (Bitcoin).
  2. Binance will generate a deposit address and ask you to **choose a network**. This is where your question comes in.
- **Key Warning**: The network you select on Binance **must match** the network your wallet uses to send the BTC. Mismatches can lead to permanent loss of funds (Binance can't recover them). Since CoinUnit.io uses the native Bitcoin network, stick to Bitcoin-based options on Binance.

### Step 3: Choose "Bitcoin" or "BTC SegWit" on Binance?
- Binance supports multiple networks for BTC deposits, but only **Bitcoin-native ones** are safe for transfers from a standard wallet like the one you'd use at a CoinUnit.io ATM. Here's a quick comparison:

| Network Option on Binance | Description | Address Starts With | Recommended? | Why? |
|---------------------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|------|
| **Bitcoin (BTC)** | Standard Bitcoin network (often Legacy or P2SH). | "1" or "3" | ✅ **Yes, safest default** | Matches exactly what CoinUnit.io sends. Lowest risk of errors; widely compatible. Fees are standard Bitcoin fees. |
| **BTC (SegWit)** | Native SegWit (bech32) on Bitcoin network. | "bc1" | ✅ Yes, if your wallet supports it | Also on the Bitcoin blockchain—fully compatible. Slightly lower fees and faster confirmations due to SegWit efficiency. Use if your wallet generates "bc1" addresses (e.g., modern wallets like Electrum). |
| **BEP20 (BSC)** | Binance Smart Chain (wrapped BTC). | Various (BEP20) | ❌ No | Wrong blockchain—your BTC would be lost. |
| **BEP2** | Binance Chain (wrapped BTC). | "bnb" | ❌ No | Wrong blockchain—lost funds. |
| **ERC20** | Ethereum network (wrapped BTC like WBTC). | "0x" | ❌ No | Wrong blockchain—lost funds. |

- **Recommendation**: Go with **Bitcoin (BTC)** unless your wallet specifically uses Native SegWit addresses (check by generating a receive address in your wallet app). Both are secure for this transfer, but "Bitcoin" is the most straightforward and forgiving for beginners.
  - Deposits on these networks confirm in 1-3 blocks (10-30 minutes typically), depending on network congestion.
  - Minimum deposit: Usually 0.0005 BTC (check Binance for current limits).
- Pro Tip: Always do a small test transaction first (e.g., 0.001 BTC) to confirm everything works before sending the full amount.

### Additional Tips
- **Fees**: CoinUnit.io charges ~5-8% for buys (varies by location). Bitcoin network fees for the transfer to Binance are ~$1-5 USD (paid from your wallet). Binance deposits are free.
- **Security**: Enable 2FA on Binance. Use a reputable wallet for the ATM scan. Avoid public Wi-Fi.
- **If Issues Arise**: Contact CoinUnit.io support (email/phone via their FAQ) for ATM help, or Binance support for deposit queries.
- For more details, check Binance's official deposit guide.

If this doesn't match what you meant (e.g., if "charge" refers to something else), provide more details for better help!
