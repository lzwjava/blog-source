Just to make sure I understand your context correctly: You're asking about the **HP ZBook Studio G10** and how its **camera shutter button** affects Zoom (or video conferencing apps) when pressed, especially with the **Fn + Shutter** key combination.  

Here’s how it works on the ZBook Studio G10:

- **Camera Shutter Button**:  
  The ZBook Studio G10 has a **physical camera shutter key** (it may be a key on the keyboard with a camera icon and a slash through it). Pressing this will **electronically disable or obstruct the camera**, which means apps like Zoom, Teams, or Google Meet immediately lose access to the video feed (your camera will show as "off").  

- **Fn + Shutter Combination**:  
  On HP laptops, some function-row keys serve dual purposes. If the **camera shutter key** is part of the top row (F8/F10/F12 depending on model), pressing it *alone* may toggle the shutter. If your function row defaults to multimedia actions, you may need to hold **Fn + Shutter** instead.  
  - Example: Pressing **Shutter** (or **Fn + Shutter**) toggles the webcam—Zoom will stop showing video if the shutter is engaged.  
  - When you press it again, the shutter reopens, and Zoom (or any app) can use your camera again.

- **Impact Inside Zoom**:  
  - If the shutter is closed: Zoom will just show a black screen or your profile picture, even if you have video enabled.  
  - If the shutter is open: Zoom will pick up your video normally.  
  - Toggling the shutter is essentially a **hardware privacy control**—it does not depend on Zoom, it overrides it.

🔹 Summary:  
On the ZBook Studio G10, clicking the **shutter button** (with or without the Fn modifier depending on your settings) **disables or enables the webcam at the hardware/firmware level**. In Zoom, you’ll see your video feed immediately cut off when shut, and it will be restored once reopened.

👉 Do you want me to also explain **how to change the function-key behavior** (so you don’t have to press Fn each time on the ZBook Studio G10)?
