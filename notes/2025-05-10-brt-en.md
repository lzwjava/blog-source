Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems are not inherently poorly designed, but certain implementations have faced criticism due to specific challenges that can undermine their effectiveness. When BRT systems fail to deliver on their promise of high-capacity, efficient, and reliable transit, it’s often due to a combination of planning, implementation, and operational issues rather than the concept itself. Below, I outline the key reasons why some BRT systems are perceived as poorly designed, drawing on available evidence and critical analysis:

1. **Overcrowding and Insufficient Capacity**  
   Many BRT systems, such as Bogotá’s TransMilenio, suffer from severe overcrowding, with reports of up to eight passengers per square meter during peak times. This stems from underestimating demand or failing to scale infrastructure (e.g., insufficient buses, stations, or lane capacity) to match population growth. Unlike rail systems, which can add more cars to a train, BRT capacity is limited by bus size and frequency, leading to packed buses and stations. For example, Jakarta’s Transjakarta has faced complaints about overcrowding and low route frequency, reducing reliability.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_rapid_transit)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_rapid_transit)

2. **Lack of Dedicated Infrastructure**  
   A true BRT system requires dedicated bus lanes, signal priority, and grade-separated corridors to avoid traffic congestion. However, some systems, like Dhaka’s BRT Line-3, have been implemented with minimal infrastructure, using existing buses and incomplete corridors, resulting in a system that resembles a standard bus service rather than a rapid transit solution. In Atlanta, the Q Express and Q Limited lines lack fully dedicated lanes, relying on queue-jumping and signal priority, which limits their speed and reliability compared to “gold standard” BRT systems like those in Ottawa or Cleveland. Without robust infrastructure, BRT loses its “rapid” advantage.[](https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/prime-example-poor-planning-3771921)[](https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/us-poor-communication-and-poor-choices-plague-bus-rapid-transit/17886/)

3. **Poor Integration with Urban Systems**  
   BRT systems often fail to integrate with other transit modes or urban planning. In Latin American cities like Bogotá and Santiago, routes are not always fully integrated with the broader public transport network, forcing passengers to make inconvenient transfers. Additionally, inadequate pedestrian infrastructure or lack of last-mile connectivity (e.g., bike-sharing or feeder buses) discourages ridership. Poor user education and public information further exacerbate this, as seen in cities where BRT was rapidly expanded without clear communication.[](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/data-and-policy/article/bus-rapid-transit-end-of-trend-in-latin-america/A9454E02DC26C5CFD5487E078A95043F)[](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/data-and-policy/article/bus-rapid-transit-end-of-trend-in-latin-america/A9454E02DC26C5CFD5487E078A95043F)

4. **Safety and Security Concerns**  
   Safety issues, particularly for women, have been a significant criticism. In Bogotá’s TransMilenio, a 2012 survey reported that 64% of women experienced sexual assault, earning it the reputation as the “most dangerous transport for women.” Jakarta’s system has also faced rampant sexual harassment and fire safety concerns, including a bus catching fire. These issues often arise from overcrowded conditions, poor station design, or inadequate security measures, which erode public trust.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_rapid_transit)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_rapid_transit)

5. **Institutional and Political Barriers**  
   Planning and implementing BRT systems face institutional complexities, including lack of technical capacity, misalignment among stakeholders, and opposition from existing bus operators. In Bangkok, despite a high-quality BRT line, the system failed to scale due to governance issues and lack of political will, serving only 15,000 passengers daily on a single 15-km line. In Dhaka, mismanagement led to the abandonment of the main corridor, leaving a fragmented system. These barriers often result in half-baked implementations that don’t meet BRT standards.[](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/retrec/v48y2014icp9-15.html)[](https://www.academia.edu/26360051/Obstacles_to_the_Creation_of_Successful_Bus_Rapid_Transit_Systems_The_Case_of_Bangkok)[](https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/prime-example-poor-planning-3771921)

6. **Perception as a “Lower-Quality” Mode**  
   BRT is sometimes seen as inferior to rail-based systems, which affects public and political support. This perception is reinforced when systems are poorly executed, as in South American cities where tri-articulated buses on minute headways still couldn’t meet demand, leading to calls for rail instead. The flexibility of BRT (e.g., routes can be changed) can also undermine its appeal for transit-oriented development, as seen in Maryland, where officials noted BRT’s movability reduces its economic impact compared to fixed rail.[](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/retrec/v48y2014icp9-15.html)[](https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/what-brt-and-what-it-isnt/1090345/)

7. **Traffic and Congestion Impacts**  
   Dedicating lanes to BRT can reduce space for general traffic, potentially worsening congestion, especially on narrow roads or bottlenecks like bridges. In some Indian cities, BRT lanes have been criticized for creating congestion by not expanding roads for other vehicles, with private cars encroaching on BRT routes to avoid traffic. Curbside bus lanes may also face interruptions from illegal parking or turning traffic, further slowing service.[](https://lyt.ai/blog/bus-rapid-transit-the-pros-and-cons-of-transit-only-lanes/)[](https://policy.tti.tamu.edu/strategy/bus-rapid-transit/)

8. **Underestimating Implementation Challenges**  
   BRT projects often underestimate the effort required for implementation, leading to delays, cost overruns, or incomplete systems. For example, Dhaka’s BRT was meant to connect Gazipur to Keraniganj but was scaled back to a Gazipur-airport route due to mismanagement. A 2014 review noted that local governments often lack the capacity to manage complex transit projects, focusing on road construction rather than operations.[](https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/prime-example-poor-planning-3771921)[](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0739885914000675)

### Counterpoint: BRT’s Potential When Done Right
Despite these issues, BRT can be highly effective when designed and implemented well. Systems like Curitiba’s (1974) and Bogotá’s TransMilenio (2000) initially set benchmarks for high-capacity, cost-effective transit, with features like dedicated lanes, off-board fare collection, and platform-level boarding. Cleveland’s Health Line and Ottawa’s Transitway demonstrate that BRT can rival light rail in speed and reliability when given proper infrastructure. The key is adhering to standards like those set by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), which emphasize exclusive lanes, frequent service, and high-quality stations.[](https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/putting-rapid-bus-transit-cities/125111/)[](https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/us-poor-communication-and-poor-choices-plague-bus-rapid-transit/17886/)[](https://itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard/)

### Conclusion
The perception of BRT as a “poor design” often stems from flawed implementations rather than the concept itself. Overcrowding, lack of dedicated infrastructure, poor integration, safety issues, and institutional barriers can turn promising BRT systems into disappointing ones. However, these problems are not universal—successful BRT systems exist where planning is robust, stakeholder alignment is achieved, and infrastructure is prioritized. To avoid poor outcomes, cities must invest in high-quality design, enforce BRT standards, and address local challenges like traffic and governance. Without these, BRT risks being a watered-down version of its potential, as seen in cases like Dhaka or Bangkok.[](https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/prime-example-poor-planning-3771921)[](https://www.academia.edu/26360051/Obstacles_to_the_Creation_of_Successful_Bus_Rapid_Transit_Systems_The_Case_of_Bangkok)

The perception that Guangzhou’s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in the Gangding and Tianhe areas is poorly designed, causing car congestion while bus lanes remain underutilized, reflects specific operational and contextual challenges. Based on available information and critical analysis, here’s a concise explanation of why this issue may arise, addressing the claim that the BRT contributes to crowded roads for cars while bus lanes appear empty:

1. **Impact of Dedicated Bus Lanes on Car Traffic**  
   Guangzhou’s BRT, launched in 2010 along Zhongshan Avenue, allocates the innermost lanes exclusively for BRT buses, reducing road space for general traffic. In busy areas like Gangding, a commercial hub with IT malls, offices, and hotels, this reallocation can exacerbate congestion, especially during peak hours. A 2012 report noted that prior to the BRT, buses struggled to navigate Gangding’s gridlock, but the dedicated lanes improved bus flow while slightly easing car traffic by streamlining overall road use. However, on narrow sections or bottlenecks, the loss of lanes for cars can still lead to perceived crowding, particularly if traffic demand exceeds road capacity. The BRT’s 22-24 meters of road width at major stations, including Gangding, prioritizes buses, which may frustrate drivers when car lanes are squeezed.[](http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201209/18/WS5a2f4359a3108bc8c67225cf.html)[](https://thecityfix.com/blog/guangzhous-brt-revolutionizing-perceptions-of-bus-travel-in-china/)

2. **Underutilized Bus Lanes**  
   The observation that bus lanes appear “often empty” could stem from the BRT’s high-frequency, direct-service model, where buses arrive every 10 seconds (350 per hour) during peak times, but gaps between buses may be more noticeable off-peak. With 42 routes operating in the corridor, including non-BRT buses using the lanes, utilization is generally high—handling 28,000 passengers per hour at peak and over 850,000 daily. However, if certain routes have lower ridership or scheduling inefficiencies, lanes may seem underused at specific times or locations like Gangding. Additionally, public perception of “empty” lanes may be skewed if buses are moving efficiently (not stuck in traffic), creating brief intervals without visible buses.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou_Bus_Rapid_Transit)[](https://www.itdp-china.org/guangzhouimpact/?lang=1)

3. **Public Perception and Resistance**  
   In Guangzhou, the BRT has faced criticism from car users, with locals jokingly calling it “Bu Rang Tong” (“not allowed to pass through”) due to the dedicated lanes reducing car access. This reflects a broader mindset in China, where private cars are often prioritized, and BRT’s right-of-way is contested. The high visibility of the BRT corridor, with its central lanes and large stations, may amplify the perception of “empty” bus lanes when contrasted with congested car lanes, even if the system is moving significant passenger volumes. For example, Gangding station alone sees over 70,000 daily boardings, indicating heavy use, but this may not be apparent to drivers stuck in traffic.[](https://thecityfix.com/blog/bus-rapid-transit-brt-china-transportation-briefing-series-guangzhou-beijing-heshuang-zeng/)[](https://itdp.org/2010/03/05/guangzhou-opens-asias-highest-capacity-brt-system/)

4. **Design and Integration Challenges**  
   While Guangzhou’s BRT is considered a “Gold Standard” system with features like prepaid boarding, metro connections, and bike-sharing integration, it’s not flawless. The system’s design prioritizes capacity and speed, but in dense areas like Tianhe, the lack of sufficient feeder routes or last-mile connectivity may limit ridership on some routes, contributing to perceptions of underuse. Additionally, the 45 cm gap between buses and station platforms at stops like Gangding can deter passengers, potentially reducing demand on certain routes. Traffic signal prioritization for BRT buses may also delay cars at intersections, worsening congestion perceptions.[](https://www.itdp-china.org/guangzhouimpact/?lang=1)[](https://gz.gov.cn/guangzhouinternational/visitors/howtogo/howtogetaround/content/post_2998244.html)

5. **Context-Specific Factors in Gangding/Tianhe**  
   Gangding’s role as a bustling commercial center means high car ownership and traffic volumes, amplifying the impact of lane reallocation. The BRT’s success in moving 1 million passengers daily (second only to Bogotá’s TransMilenio) shows it serves a critical need, but its benefits may be less visible to car users. Urban growth in Tianhe, with new developments since the BRT’s 2010 opening, may have outpaced road capacity, making car congestion more noticeable. If recent reports (post-2020) indicate persistent issues, they could reflect inadequate adjustments to rising traffic or suboptimal bus scheduling.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou_Bus_Rapid_Transit)

### Critical Perspective
Guangzhou’s BRT is a global leader, winning awards like the 2011 Sustainable Transport Award for reducing CO2 emissions by 50,000 tons in its first year and boosting public transport use from 520,000 to 830,000 daily passengers along Zhongshan Avenue. However, the system’s success in prioritizing buses can come at the expense of car users’ convenience in dense areas like Gangding, where road space is contested. The “empty lane” perception may be a misinterpretation of efficient bus flow or off-peak scheduling gaps rather than a fundamental design flaw. Still, local authorities could address these concerns by optimizing bus frequencies, improving traffic signal coordination to balance car and bus flow, or expanding road capacity where feasible. The lack of recent (2024-2025) reports on this specific issue limits definitive conclusions, but historical data suggests the BRT’s design is robust but not immune to localized challenges.[](https://apjjf.org/2018/14/liu)

### Conclusion
The Guangzhou BRT in Gangding and Tianhe isn’t inherently “very poor” in design—its high capacity, metro integration, and environmental benefits prove otherwise. However, dedicating central lanes to buses can worsen car congestion in busy areas, while efficient bus operations or scheduling gaps may make lanes appear underused. These issues reflect trade-offs in prioritizing public transit over private cars, compounded by public resistance and urban growth. To mitigate this, Guangzhou could explore better bus scheduling, enhanced traffic management, or public campaigns to highlight the BRT’s benefits. If you have specific recent reports or observations about the BRT’s performance in Gangding, I can analyze those further!
