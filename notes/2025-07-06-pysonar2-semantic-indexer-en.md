PySonar2 is a semantic indexer for Python, developed by yinwang0, that utilizes interprocedural type inference to analyze large Python codebases. It is designed for batch processing, making it suitable for creating indexes for code browsers and search engines rather than real-time Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Its primary focus is on accuracy through type inference, which aims to describe how code is actually used.

**Key Features and Characteristics:**

* **Semantic Indexing:** PySonar2's core function is to build a semantic index of Python code, enabling advanced code navigation and search capabilities.
* **Interprocedural Type Inference:** It employs sophisticated interprocedural type inference to understand the flow and usage of types across an entire codebase, contributing to its accuracy.
* **Batch Processing:** Optimized for processing large projects in a batch manner, contrasting with real-time analysis tools.
* **Library for Developer Tools:** PySonar2 is intended as a foundational library for other developer tools, not as a standalone end-user application.
* **Apache-2.0 License:** The project is open-source under the Apache-2.0 license, allowing for free use, modification, and distribution.

**Adoption and Usage:**

PySonar2 has seen significant adoption in the industry, notably serving as the indexing engine for:

* Google's internal Code Search
* sourcegraph.com
* insight.io

**Technical Details:**

* **Languages:** The repository is predominantly written in Java (94.4%), with Python (5.1%) used for the analysis target.
* **Build System:** It uses Maven for building. To build the project, run `mvn package -DskipTests`.
* **Demo:** A demo is available to build a simple code browser for the Python 2.7 standard library using a Java command.
* **System Requirements:** Requires Python 2.7.x or 3.x, Java 8+, and Maven. Correct configuration of `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variables is crucial.
* **Testing:** Unit tests can be executed with `mvn test`. New tests involve creating Python code in directories ending with ".test" within the `tests` directory.

**Repository Status:**

The repository has gained considerable attention, evidenced by:

* **1.4k stars**
* **506 forks**

Recent commits indicate ongoing maintenance, including updates to the README and version, and fixes for code smells.

**Contributions:**

Contributions are welcome, though significant changes are encouraged to be discussed with the maintainer due to the complex underlying theory of the project.
