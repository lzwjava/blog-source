### Basic Electronic Components

1. Resistor Types: Resistors limit current flow in a circuit. Types include fixed resistors, which have a fixed resistance value, and variable resistors like potentiometers, which allow adjustable resistance.

2. Capacitor Types: Capacitors store and release electrical energy. Types include ceramic capacitors, which are commonly used for high-frequency applications, and electrolytic capacitors, which have higher capacitance values but are polarized.

3. Inductors: Inductors store energy in a magnetic field and oppose changes in current. They are used in filtering and tuning applications.

4. Diodes: Diodes allow current to flow in one direction only. Zener diodes are used for voltage regulation, while LEDs emit light when forward biased.

5. Transistors: Transistors, such as BJTs, act as electronic switches or amplifiers, with NPN and PNP types controlling current flow in circuits.
