In the context of HTML meta tags like `<meta property="og:type" content="website">`, "og" stands for Open Graph. This refers to the Open Graph protocol, which is a standard originally developed by Facebook (now Meta) to allow web pages to provide structured metadata about their content. This metadata controls how the page appears when shared on social media platforms or messaging apps, such as displaying a title, description, image, and other details in a rich preview format (e.g., a card with an image and summary).

The protocol uses properties prefixed with "og:" to define elements like:
- `og:title`: The title of the content.
- `og:description`: A brief summary.
- `og:image`: A URL for a preview image.
- `og:type`: The type of content (e.g., website, article, video).

While it was created for Facebook, many other platforms and apps support Open Graph tags for link previews, including WeChat. When you share a link on WeChat, it often parses these tags to generate thumbnails, titles, and descriptions consistently. If the tags aren't present, platforms might fall back to other meta tags or scrape the page content, which can lead to inconsistent results.

Your guess of "open gx" seems close—it's actually "Open Graph," not "open gx" (possibly a typo or autocorrect for "graph"?).
