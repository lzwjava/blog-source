To install `xdotool` on your Linux system, you can use your distribution's package manager. Based on your hostname showing "XiaoXin", you're likely using Ubuntu or a Debian-based distribution. Here are the installation commands for common Linux distributions:

## Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xdotool
```

## CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:
```bash
# For newer versions (dnf)
sudo dnf install xdotool

# For older versions (yum)
sudo yum install xdotool
```

## Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S xdotool
```

## openSUSE:
```bash
sudo zypper install xdotool
```

After installation, you can verify it's working by running:
```bash
xdotool --version
```

Once installed, your Python script should be able to use `xdotool` to retrieve the browser title. The `xdotool` utility is commonly used for automating X11 desktop tasks, including getting window titles, which is what your script appears to be trying to do.

If you're still having issues after installation, make sure:
1. You're running the script in an X11 environment (not Wayland)
2. You have an active browser window open
3. The browser window has focus or is visible
