title: Top 100 Python Pip Packages by Downloads (2025 Approximation)
translated: false
---

As of 2025, a definitive list of the top 100 Python pip packages by download count is not directly available in a single reliable source, due to the dynamic nature of PyPI (Python Package Index) and the lack of real-time access to comprehensive download statistics in my data. However, I can provide an informed approximation based on recent trends, historical data from sources like the "Top PyPI Packages" repository, and insights from posts found on X and web analyses up to June 2025.[](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/)[](https://github.com/hugovk/top-pypi-packages)

The "Top PyPI Packages" project by hugovk on GitHub provides a monthly dump of the 15,000 most-downloaded packages from PyPI, which is a strong starting point. Additionally, analyses from 2024 and early 2025 highlight packages critical to data science, machine learning, web development, and DevOps, which consistently dominate download rankings. Below, I’ll list 100 packages that are likely among the most downloaded in 2025, grouped by category for clarity, with explanations for their prominence. Note that exact rankings may vary slightly due to monthly fluctuations and emerging tools.[](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/)[](https://github.com/hugovk/top-pypi-packages)

### Methodology
- **Source**: Extrapolated from the 15,000 most-downloaded packages in the hugovk dataset (last updated 2025-01), combined with insights from blogs, X posts, and developer discussions.[](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/)
- **Criteria**: Prioritized packages with historically high downloads (e.g., boto3, urllib3, requests), widespread use across industries, and mentions in 2024–2025 Python ecosystem reports.[](https://medium.com/top-python-libraries/top-15-python-packages-with-100-million-downloads-in-2024-75e4c3627b6d)[](https://medium.com/%40kasperjuunge/20-most-downloaded-python-packages-explained-f5cded2eb70d)
- **Limitations**: Without real-time PyPI stats, this list is an educated estimate. Some niche or newer packages may be underrepresented, and exact download counts are unavailable.
