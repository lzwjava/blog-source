Yes, Macau has several ports of entry that support 24-hour transit (customs clearance), primarily for cross-border travel with mainland China (such as Zhuhai) or Hong Kong. These ports typically use a "cooperative inspection, one-time clearance" model, with high efficiency and an average clearance time of about 30 seconds. Below is a brief overview of the main ports (based on the latest available data as of November 2025; always refer to official announcements for real-time details):
