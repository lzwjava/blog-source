#### **Ingredients:**  
- **6-8 frozen egg tart shells** (or homemade puff pastry)  
- **2 large eggs**  
- **100ml (½ cup) whole milk** (full-fat for best texture)  
- **100ml (½ cup) heavy cream** (or evaporated milk for richer flavor)  
- **40g (3 tbsp) granulated sugar** (adjust to taste)  
- **½ tsp vanilla extract** (optional)

### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**  

#### **1. Prepare the Custard Filling**  
- Whisk eggs, milk, heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla until smooth.  
- Strain the mixture through a sieve to remove bubbles for a silky texture.  

#### **2. Fill the Tart Shells**  
- Place **frozen tart shells** in the air fryer basket (no thawing needed).  
- Fill each shell **¾ full** (they expand while cooking).  

#### **3. Air Fry the Egg Tarts**  
- **Preheat** air fryer to **160°C (320°F)** for 3 minutes.  
- Cook at **160°C (320°F) for 10–12 minutes** until:  
  - Custard is **set but slightly jiggly**.  
  - Pastry is **golden and flaky**.  
- *Tip:* Cover loosely with foil if pastry browns too quickly.  

#### **4. Cool & Serve**  
- Let cool for 5 minutes before eating (custard firms as it cools).  
- Enjoy warm or chilled!

### **Ingredient Substitutions & Tips:**  
#### **Milk Options:**  
- **Best:** Whole milk (creamy) or evaporated milk (richer).  
- **Lighter:** Low-fat milk (add 1 extra yolk for richness).  
- **Dairy-free:** Oat milk + 1 tsp cornstarch (less creamy).  

#### **Sugar Options:**  
- Granulated sugar works best (dissolves evenly).  
- For caramel notes, use **brown sugar** (reduce by 1 tbsp).  
- Sugar-free? Substitute with **erythritol** (1:1 ratio).  

#### **Heavy Cream Alternatives:**  
- **Simpler:** Use 50% milk + 50% evaporated milk.  
- **Luxury:** Double cream (extra rich, less stable).  
- **Dairy-free:** Coconut cream (shaken, not stirred).  

#### **Pastry Shortcuts:**  
- **No shells?** Use puff pastry cut into circles.  
- **Extra flaky?** Brush shells with melted butter pre-baking.

### **Troubleshooting:**  
- **Custard bubbly?** Strain better or pour slower.  
- **Shells soggy?** Preheat air fryer longer.  
- **Overflowing?** Fill only ⅔ full next time.

### **Final Pro Tip:**  
For **Portuguese-style tarts**, sprinkle cinnamon or caramelize the tops with a kitchen torch!
