title: Meta AI Unit Layoffs Amid Reorganization
translated: false

### Overview of Meta's Recent Layoffs
Meta Platforms Inc. announced layoffs affecting approximately 600 employees in its Meta Superintelligence Labs, the company's core artificial intelligence (AI) division, as part of an ongoing reorganization effort.[1][2][3][1] These cuts were revealed in an internal memo from Meta's chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, and represent a small fraction (out of several thousand roles) of the AI unit's workforce, aimed at streamlining operations.[2][4][5] The layoffs occurred amid Meta's broader cost-management strategy, with the company previously projecting 2025 expenses around $116 billion.[6]

### Reasons and Internal Details
In the memo, Wang described the Superintelligence Labs as "bloated" and in need of efficiency improvements to accelerate progress toward advanced AI goals, such as superintelligence development.[4][4] He emphasized that the cuts would allow the team to "cement leadership" and focus on high-impact areas without specifying which roles were eliminated.[1][6] This follows Meta's aggressive hiring spree in AI, including poaching top talent, but highlights a shift toward leaner structures amid rising operational costs.[7][8] Employees affected were notified directly, though details on severance or support packages were not publicly disclosed in the reports.

### Additional Layoffs in Related Areas
Beyond the AI unit, Meta conducted separate cuts impacting more than 100 employees in its risk review organization, which monitors potential harms to users, such as privacy and safety risks.[9][9] Some of these roles were explicitly replaced by technological solutions, including AI tools, signaling a broader automation trend within the company.[10][10] This brings Meta's recent job reductions to over 700, though it's unclear if these were part of the same initiative.

### Broader Industry Context
Meta's moves align with a wave of tech layoffs in 2025, driven by AI integration, economic uncertainty, and cost-cutting.[11][12][13] Over 150,000 tech jobs were cut across 549 companies last year, with 2025 continuing the trend—examples include Intel, Rivian, and Paycom.[12][13] AI-specific layoffs have become "trendy" in big tech, as firms like Meta balance heavy investments (e.g., in data centers and chips) with workforce optimization.[8][8] Despite the cuts, Meta's AI ambitions remain robust, with Wang's leadership focusing on long-term innovation rather than immediate expansion.[14][14]
