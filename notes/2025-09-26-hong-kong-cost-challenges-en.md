Hong Kong is famous for its high cost of living—rent, dining, and even daily essentials can feel steep compared to many other cities. The fast pace, crowded spaces, and intense work culture can also add to the stress, so it’s not surprising that people sometimes vent their frustrations. The city’s mix of extreme wealth and high expenses can make life challenging, especially for those not in the top income brackets.

But there’s another side too: Hong Kong is vibrant, efficient, and full of opportunities. Many people love its energy, convenience, and the way it blends East and West. The complaints often come from the pressure of living in such a competitive environment, but the city also has a strong community spirit and unique charm.

Do you feel the cost of living is the biggest challenge, or are there other aspects that stand out to you? Or are you just observing from afar?
