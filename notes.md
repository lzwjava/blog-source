## Information Sensitivity

I mentioned friends in the essays to say some things. Most of the behaviors or speaking I mentioned are public messages on the Internet, from the blogs or public social media platforms of my friends. Some are private. But actually, I have observed that on the Internet too. So I have my right to say so publicly. And most of these messages are positive or neutral. And for the negative messages, actually, I want to point out the problem for making things better.

我在文章中提到了朋友，是为了表达一些事情。我提到的大多数行为或言论都是从我朋友的博客或公共社交媒体平台上获取的公开信息。其中一些是私人的。但实际上，我在互联网上也观察到了这些情况。所以我有权公开地说这些话。而且其中大部分信息都是积极或中立的。至于负面的信息，实际上我是希望指出问题，以便改进事物。
