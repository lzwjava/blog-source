    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "line": "Absolutely! Von Neumann uses a single bus for both data and instructions, which can cause bottlenecks. Harvard separates them, enabling parallel fetches—common in DSPs and microcontrollers. Which use case interests you more?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "line": "Embedded systems, actually. Harvard seems dominant there. But how do modern hybrids like modified Harvard architectures bridge the gap?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "line": "Great question! Hybrids use split caches (L1 for instructions/data) but a unified memory space. Take ARM Cortex-M: it’s Harvard-like for speed but simplifies programming. Trade-offs?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "line": "Potentially! RISC-V’s modular ISA lets designers add Harvard-like features per application. For IoT edge devices, that’s a game-changer. But ARM’s ecosystem is entrenched. What’s your take?"

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "line": "Crucial! Offloading data transfers (e.g., ADC to memory) saves CPU cycles. STM32’s DMA even handles peripheral-to-peripheral transfers. Ever worked with circular DMA buffers?"
    },

        "speaker": "A",
        "line": "Yes, for audio processing. But configuring burst modes was tricky. How does DMA prioritize requests when multiple peripherals compete?"

        "speaker": "B",

        "speaker": "B",
        "line": "RTOSes add layers: context saving, scheduler invocations post-ISR. FreeRTOS’s ‘FromISR’ APIs manage this safely. But bare-metal ISRs are leaner—trade-off between complexity and control."
