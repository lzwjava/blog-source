      /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/setuptools/command/build_py.py:204: _Warning: Package 'langdetect.profiles' is absent from the `packages` configuration.
      !!
      
              ********************************************************************************
              ############################
              # Package would be ignored #
              ############################
              Python recognizes 'langdetect.profiles' as an importable package[^1],
              but it is absent from setuptools' `packages` configuration.
      
              This leads to an ambiguous overall configuration. If you want to distribute this
              package, please make sure that 'langdetect.profiles' is explicitly added
              to the `packages` configuration field.
      
              Alternatively, you can also rely on setuptools' discovery methods
              (for example by using `find_namespace_packages(...)`/`find_namespace:`
              instead of `find_packages(...)`/`find:`).
      
              You can read more about "package discovery" on setuptools documentation page:
      
              - https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html
      
              If you don't want 'langdetect.profiles' to be distributed and are
              already explicitly excluding 'langdetect.profiles' via
              `find_namespace_packages(...)/find_namespace` or `find_packages(...)/find`,
              you can try to use `exclude_package_data`, or `include-package-data=False` in
              combination with a more fine grained `package-data` configuration.
      
              You can read more about "package data files" on setuptools documentation page:
      
              - https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html
      
      
              [^1]: For Python, any directory (with suitable naming) can be imported,
                    even if it does not contain any `.py` files.
                    On the other hand, currently there is no concept of package data
                    directory, all directories are treated like packages.
