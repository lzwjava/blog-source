title: The journy of reversing myopia naturally

Besides three papers about reversing myopia, I want to share more about this disvovery story.

## Patience

As revesring myopia naturally is kind of slow, just like the losing weight. In my 3 years experience(From 2022.2 to 2025.1), I got the achievement as below.

Time | Left Eye Myopia | Left Eye Astigmatism | Right Eye Myopia | Right Eye Astigmatism| Correct Vision
2022.03.05 | -3.50 | -2.25 | -5.75 | -1.75| 1.0
2022.11.13 | -3.25 | -2.00 | -5.50 | -1.75| 0.9
2023.04.20 | -3.00 | -1.25 | -5.00 | -1.25| 1.0
2024.01.07 | -3.00 | -1.00 | -4.75 | -1.25| 0.9
2024.11.28 | -2.50 | -1.00 | -4.25 | -1.25| 0.9

Let's use python to draw a paragraph about it.

So need to be patient about it. 

## Do the right thing, result will happen

But as long as you do the right thing, result will happen. Just like losing weight, eating very little and play sports often will lose weight. If every month is 1kg, then one year is 12kg. 

Just like learning too, if we learn 10 hours a day, then one year it is 3650 hours. 

The goods new for reversing myopia is that there are nothing hard in it that you cannot insist on. It just needs you to see mobile phone or computer barely clear. 

This is a better and comfortable way to do. Just like you have urine, and you go to toilet. Wearing the eye glases with full degree just likes to doctor tell you unless you have holding as most as possible your urine, then you can go to toilet. This is surely bullshit.

The cost of using correct way is that, I need to prepare another pair of eye glasses with full degrees in prescription to drive, see the views when traveling, see movies in theater. 

Those time in life actually is just a few part, like at most 2 hours in a day waking as 15 hours often. 

## Don't settle, continue to improve

In the first year, my primary activity involved computer work, during which I wore glasses with a 150-degree reduction. This setup allowed me to frequently experience the "just barely clear" state, where vision was sufficiently clear without being overly sharp. However, in the second year, as I shifted my focus to studying for my associate degree at home, I reduced my computer usage and primarily relied on my mobile phone for reading materials and exercises.

And after talking with a friend , I started to learn bifocols lenses and multifoculs progressive lenses. I even learned the words like Segment Height or Segment Position, Working Distance for Vision. 

It need a lot of trying. Grab the principle, and the solutions can be varied. 

Now, I wear a pair of
