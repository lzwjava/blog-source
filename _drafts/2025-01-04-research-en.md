Besides three papers about reversing myopia, I want to share more about this disvovery story.

## Patience

As revesring myopia naturally is kind of slow, just like the losing weight. In my 3 years experience(From 2022.2 to 2025.1), I got the achievement as below.

Time | Left Eye Myopia | Left Eye Astigmatism | Right Eye Myopia | Right Eye Astigmatism| Correct Vision
2022.03.05 | -3.50 | -2.25 | -5.75 | -1.75| 1.0
2022.11.13 | -3.25 | -2.00 | -5.50 | -1.75| 0.9
2023.04.20 | -3.00 | -1.25 | -5.00 | -1.25| 1.0
2024.01.07 | -3.00 | -1.00 | -4.75 | -1.25| 0.9
2024.11.28 | -2.50 | -1.00 | -4.25 | -1.25| 0.9

Let's use python to draw a paragraph about it.

So need to be patient about it. 

## Do the right thing, result will happen

But as long as you do the right thing, result will happen. Just like losing weight, eating very little and play sports often will lose weight. If every month is 1kg, then one year is 12kg. 

Just like learning too, if we learn 10 hours a day, then one year it is 3650 hours. 

The goods new for reversing myopia is that there are nothing hard in it that you cannot insist on. It just needs you to see mobile phone or computer barely clear. 

This is a better and comfortable way to do. Just like you have urine, and you go to toilet. Wearing the eye glases with full degree just likes to doctor tell you unless you have holding as most as possible your urine, then you can go to toilet. This is surely bullshit.

The cost of using correct way is that, I need to prepare another pair of eye glasses with full degrees in prescription to drive, see the views when traveling, see movies in theater. 

Those time in life actually is just a few part, like at most 2 hours in a day waking as 15 hours often. 

## Don't settle, continue to improve

In the first year, my primary activity involved computer work, during which I wore glasses with a 150-degree reduction. This setup allowed me to frequently experience the "just barely clear" state, where vision was sufficiently clear without being overly sharp. However, in the second year, as I shifted my focus to studying for my associate degree at home, I reduced my computer usage and primarily relied on my mobile phone for reading materials and exercises.

And after talking with a friend , I started to learn bifocols lenses and multifoculs progressive lenses. I even learned the words like Segment Height or Segment Position, Working Distance for Vision. 

It need a lot of trying. Grab the principle, and the solutions can be varied. From the plain +1.50D addition to the prescription, and then +2.00D addtion to the prescription, then using multifocal progressive lens to help. There are still ways to improve.

After ChatGPT comes out, there are still a lot of improvement. A lot of smart people try to think in that direction. And in real world, there are many use cases and have more real problems to solve.

For the reversing myopia, it is exactly same.

## Share to the urgently need

Though I shared my reversing myopia article in WeChat Subscription Platform at June 2023. At Decomeber 2024, I received the reply that someone who claimed his 12 yo'kid are frusted with his myopia degree with 500, that is -5.00. When I was 12, I thought I just began to wear myopia with degree like -2.00. 

As the truth or disvoery are less known to people, only the urgently need people want try to do this. This reversing myopia way, probably first introduced by Todd Becker in 2014, will be popular one day. 

There isn't negative effect about new adjustment way. And there will be more and more people have myopia and the myopia degrees become large and larege. 

## Does conspircy in myopia 

I think people wearing full degrees of eyeglases , that made their myopia deepen. The myopia isn't made by someone deliberately. It is just that human beings are not careful. It seems normal to wear the full degrees to get back normal eyesight as 5.0, the eyesight of a kid. 

However, what human beings don't know it is that they use it to look near things. The people who invented multifocal progreesive lenses or vision tester knew a lot about how eye or myopia works. 

So the improvement here is just that we categorize how we use our eyes. We observe that human beings nowadays are mostly using phone or computer. And it doesn't matter that we see the things far away vaguely in daily life. 


## How to do it again

Try to observe and learn more in the Internet. Be careful to those minor opinions. Try experiment by myself. 

There are a lot of improvment in life. After truth was found, it seems obvious.
