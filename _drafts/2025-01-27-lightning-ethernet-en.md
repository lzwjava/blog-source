title: Lightning to Ethernet Adapter
---

I recently tried a new product that I had never used before. It cost me about 44 CNY on JD.com. Similar products cost around 15 USD on Walmart.com.

It works perfectly. No extra settings are needed. An "Ethernet" menu item appears after plugging in the adapter.

I used the Speedtest iOS app to test the speed. The results are below.

| Network Type                     | Distance   | Download Speed (MBPS) | Upload Speed | Line             |
|----------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Modem -> TP-LINK Router -> Phone | around 30m | 2.90                  | 4.82         | Guangzhou -> Macao |
| Modem -> Cable -> Phone          | around 30m | 84.9                 | 59.7         | Guangzhou -> Macao |
