I am very excited to try this cloud platform recently.

A Helsinki server with a configuration of 2 VCPUs AMD, 2GB RAM, 40GB SSD, and 20TB Traffic costs $4.49 USD per month.

One IPv4 address is $0.60 USD per month, bringing the total to $5.09 USD per month.

They provide services in six locations:

- Nuremberg, Germany
- Falkenstein, Germany
- Helsinki, Finland
- Singapore, Singapore
- Hillsboro, OR, USA
- Ashburn, VA, USA

It is very interesting that they don't follow trends to select popular locations. Their locations are different from those of Vultr or Digital Ocean.

The firewall setting is easy. thought this is first time to use , I quickly set up correct conifugration for my proxy server.
