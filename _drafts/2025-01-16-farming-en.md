We cound't change the past but we surely could try to reflect more from the past to have more benefits from it to have a better future.

It seems old-fashioned to live in viliage and participate farming in moder life. But I believe that experience will help me in other aspects.

I was born at Meizhou, Guangdong in 1995. I lived there until I was 9 years old, 2004. My mother brought me to Guangzhou to live with my father. 

I participated the farming work in 3 years from 2001 to 2004, like sowing, rice harvesting, drying grain. 

One thing to learn is that this kind of activities are heavelity relied on atmosphere and whether. If it is going to rain, you have to collect the drying grain quickly to avoid getting wet. 

How many times do we plant and harvest rice?  By Mistral,

> In Meizhou, Guangdong, the typical rice cultivation pattern allows for two harvests per year. This is known as double-cropping. The two main seasons for rice cultivation are:

> 1. **Early Rice (早稻)** - Sown in the spring and harvested in the summer.
> 2. **Late Rice (晚稻)** - Sown in the summer and harvested in the fall.

> So, in Meizhou, farmers generally plant and harvest rice twice a year. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask!

But actually I couldn't be sure about it. What I remembered is that in summar, we will harvest rice. We at least plant and harvest rice for one time a year. 

When sowing, there are insects in the farmland. We threshed grain using a machine.
