- Pay around 30 CNY to buy second-hand radios, mobile phones, smart watches, routers, etc.

- Dismantle things to learn how they work.

- Knowledge is precious.

- When I did so, after getting some products like a wireless speaker or a Xiaomi Wi-Fi device, which were released almost 10 years ago, they still worked well. This disappoints me because I want them to stop working so I can dismantle them without feeling like I'm wasting things.

- Bought Wireless Smart USB Speaker E-91 / E-3557 - Black (similar to this: https://lcd-phone.com/en/speaker/26815-copy-of-sound-bar-luminous-and-speaker-wired-usb-e-1411-black-6938607789315.html).

- Bought Xiaomi Mi Router 4C (https://www.mi.com/global/product/mi-router-4c/).

- In 2025, I bought a second-hand iPod Touch 4. On its iOS system, the voice memo, camera, browser, and calculator still work well, but iTunes, Movies, Maps, and the App Store are unusable.
