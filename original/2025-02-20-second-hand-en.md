title: Buy Cheap Second-Hand Goods

- Pay around 30 CNY to buy second-hand radios, mobile phones, smart watches, routers, etc.

- Dismantle things to learn how they work.

- Knowledge is precious.

- When I did so, after getting some products like a wireless speaker or a Xiaomi Wi-Fi device, which were released almost 10 years ago, they still worked well. This disappoints me because I want them to stop working so I can dismantle them without feeling like I'm wasting things.

- Bought Wireless Smart USB Speaker E-91 / E-3557 - Black (similar to this: https://lcd-phone.com/en/speaker/26815-copy-of-sound-bar-luminous-and-speaker-wired-usb-e-1411-black-6938607789315.html).

- Bought Xiaomi Mi Router 4C.

- In 2025, I also acquired an iPod Touch 4th generation, which operates on iOS 6.1.6. On its iOS system, the voice memo, camera, browser, and calculator still work well, but iTunes, Movies, Maps, and the App Store are unusable.

- The apps that don't need a server, like Camera and Voice Memo, will be more stable after years.

- The projector lacked a power cable, so I bought one from JD.com. A similar power cord from Walmart is the "TV Power Cord 59inch for TCL: 2 Prong AC Wall Plug 2-Slot Two flat 8-suffix power cords with holes."

- I bought a Vivo Y51A running Android 5.1.1.
