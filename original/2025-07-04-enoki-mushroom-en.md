title: Enoki Mushrooms Are Easy to Deteriorate
translated: false
---

Enoki mushrooms are easy to deteriorate. I bought them from JD.com. It takes 3 or 4 days to deliver to my home. They use an ice pack to keep them cold, but the ice pack can easily melt within one or two days.

The smell is unpleasant when enoki mushrooms deteriorate.

I bought them twice. The first time, I remember that after the delivery package arrived at my home, I opened it after one or two days. I thought it was my problem for not opening it on time.

The second time, when it arrived at my home, I opened it on time but still found that it had a sour smell, which means it had deteriorated.

It is summer in Guangzhou, and the temperatures during the day range between 26 to 36 degrees.

I confirmed this with AI chatbots. It is quite challenging to keep them fresh outside, even with an ice pack.

Therefore, the transportation of fresh products may need improvement. They should be kept in a refrigerator during transit. The delivery company just wraps the enoki mushrooms in a foam box.
