These are some links and apps I check daily or every few days. Typically, I use apps for updates, and for desktop use, I often rely on AI tools. They greatly impact my thinking. I like to find the best way to do things.

On my home screen, I have apps for essential daily use, including the App Store, browser, news, to-do list, proxy app, AI chatbots, crypto trading, as well as banking and asset management apps. These are the tools I rely on for staying updated and organized.

Here are some of my most used apps on my main phone - an iOS device.

I can be selective about this, and few people will be offended. Most of these are famous or popular products, so they probably won't care whether I like them or not - I'm just one user among many. I also contribute to these platforms.

I include my personal blog website here. I check it frequently and update it sometimes. By doing so, I can better reflect on what I've done and share information I find useful with others.
