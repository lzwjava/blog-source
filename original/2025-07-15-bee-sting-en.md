title: A Bee Sting Incident and Recovery
translated: false
type: post
---

I was stung by a bee on July 1, 2025. After two weeks, around July 15, 2025, my finger had recovered significantly. The most painful moments were probably July 2 and July 3, the two days following the sting.

At the invitation of a friend, I went to the Baihua Resort Hotel to swim in Zengcheng. I saw something floating above the water. Since my swimming goggles are not prescription ones, I couldn't see clearly. So, I used my hand to figure out what it was and intended to throw it out of the pool.

However, the moment I touched it, I got stung. A sudden feeling of regret overwhelmed me. Everything happened so fast—just a few seconds—and an accident occurred. Moments before, I had been happy and peaceful; moments after, my finger started to ache.

The first moment a bee stings you, your finger will have an immediate reaction, and the stung area may exhibit some allergic response. I wanted to go to the hospital for a check-up. Later, I consulted an online doctor from JD.com. He told me that trying to drain the blood or liquid from the swelling area by myself was not advisable. Instead, I should visit a doctor to have it done in a clean, bacteria-free environment.

I didn't go and waited a few more days. Then, I noticed that the skin started to break a bit on its own, and liquid began to come out. I used a needle to help enlarge the opening.
