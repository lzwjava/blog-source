title: New Quora or TikTok Fully Powered by AI Translation
type: post
---

* A new TikTok or Quora fully powered by AI translation.

* Similar to X, Threads, Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, YouTube.

* These platforms, which already have international subdomains, are most in need of such features due to their large international user base.

* Every post or answer created by users can be saved in a single language. To simplify, it should use the platform’s default language. Before submission, the system translates content into that language, or users can edit the content at any time.

* Platforms will automatically translate content into 20 languages.

* AI tools will issue warnings for naming translations, as names are often difficult to translate correctly. In edge cases, it should warn users or allow for human correction.

* Users can view content in their preferred language.

* Text in images and audio in videos can also be translated. The `EzDubs` bot in X is a step toward this future.

* Zoom or Teams meetings should also support translation, with translation speed being crucial in these settings.
