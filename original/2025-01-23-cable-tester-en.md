title: Network Cable Tester
---

I recently purchased a network cable tester from JD.com. I have seen network consultants come to my home or my employer's office to test the network.

This device is very inexpensive, costing only about 10 CNY. A similar product at Walmart would cost around 10 USD.

For this post, I am using an image from Amazon.com.
