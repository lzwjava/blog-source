I know some basic electronics. The formula `V=IR` means that voltage equals current multiplied by resistance.

I recently learned about rectifiers. A rectifier converts Alternating Current (AC) to Direct Current (DC). Alternating Current is preferred for transportation to reduce electricity loss.

The formula Q = I * R^2 means that as current increases, Q will generate a lot of heat.

So, why do we have encoders and decoders? An encoder converts multiple inputs into a single output. A decoder converts a single input into multiple outputs.

There are analog circuits and digital circuits. I have read stories about them and how people invented them.

Analog circuits is about turning continuous singal. Digital curcuits are using the discrete singal to indicate. 

There is BJT , bipolar junction transistor. bipolor means N and P, Negative and Positive. Transistor works like a switch.
