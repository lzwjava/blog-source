## Left Swipe in iOS Lists

The left swipe gesture is a powerful feature that allows users to access hidden functionalities within apps. While right swiping is often the default action (e.g., WeChat doesn’t support left swipes in its conversation list), experimenting with left swipes in other apps can unlock valuable options. When navigating through lists, try swiping left to reveal additional features that can enhance your user experience.

## Apps Are Linked to the Apple Account

If I install apps using Apple Account A and later log in with Apple Account B, I will need to enter the password for Account A in order to update the apps associated with it. This is because apps are linked to the Apple ID used during installation, not the device itself.
