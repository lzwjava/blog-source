* Use he/she or one together

* Do not just use he or she, if we don't have specific person.

* Don't not let limitation of language limit your thoughts.

* He/she can help you imagine, but one is simple and abstract.

* For other languages, it is same too. Use 他/她 together or 一个人。

* I should learn more language to separte he/she.
