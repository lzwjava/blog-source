The 5.5-watt bulb is too bright for comfortable reading in my bedroom when positioned approximately 60 centimeters behind me on the left side.

I use an LED bulb in my car to create a lighter environment. One is for nighttime use, which makes the interior brightness similar to the outside light. This bulb is 15 watts.

The electric lamp I use for studying is 2 watts.
