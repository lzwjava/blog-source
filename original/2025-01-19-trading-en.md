- Use a dedicated bank account for P2P trading when buying cryptocurrency. It's easy to record videos or take screenshots to allow merchants to verify the transaction history.

- It's preferable to hold the native coin of a network; for example, SOL on Solana, or ETH on Ethereum.

- Personally, I use Binance, OKX, and Phantom.

- Consider what can be trusted and what cannot.

- Most things are assets and have values measured in money. Over time, the value of some assets will increase, while the value of others will decrease. Exchange less valuable assets for more valuable ones.

- The significance of anyone's thoughts or actions should be relative to their market capitalization. As I have few holdings, my thoughts are of little consequence.

- Analyze things objectively.

- Them: Congrats! You made a lot of money on Bitcoin, right? Changpeng Zhao: No, not exactly. I still have the same number of Bitcoins. It's just that everything else has become a little cheaper relative to Bitcoin.
