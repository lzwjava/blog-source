- People are born, grow, eat, relieve themselves, sleep, work, study, rest, travel, think, speak, hear, touch, write, read, walk, jump, play sports, use mobile phones, play games, fight, kill, recover, build, destroy and die.

- This is a society full of people—my 1-year-old, 5-year-old, 10-year-old, 15-year-old, 20-year-old, and 25-year-old selves—growing, studying, or working.  

- I am male. There are many females who have hobbies like mine, know the same things I do, get similar scores, or work in the same industry as me.  

- I am 30 years old. About half of the people around me are older than I am. Many of them know more than I do, earn more than I do, or have been to more places than I have.  

- When I was as young as 10 years old or 20 years old, the way I looked at older people is similar to how I now look at younger people.  

- Everyone lives their own life; some things we have in common, while other things are different.  

- People speak different languages, live in different places, work on different things, and interact with different people.
