I use a proxy server as my VPN to access the Internet. This traffic data indicates whether I am online or not. If you have my invitation or need to reach me, you can check here and then send me a direct message.

It is not exactly accurate. If the 5-minute average traffic is greater than 7KB per second, then I will mark it as online; otherwise, offline.
