title: AI Tools Tips

* Copy example code into Cursor, and use comments to provide context.

* In the Hong Kong region, it is acceptable to use DeepSeek or Mistral services, while it is not acceptable to use ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

* The API policy of a region is approximately the same as its app policy.

* Use Cursor instead of Visual Studio Code.

* There are still cases where you need to use Visual Studio Code, such as for git merge editor scenarios, where I still use `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`.

* Starting the day from Deepseek V3 release, we don't need to sunbscribe any AI tools.

* Use Gemini or Grok to generate festival celebration images with prompts like "Generate a happy Lunar Snake New Year image with text names included".

* In some cases, even when providing original text to AI models to create a table, a few places in the output may differ from the input. For example, when using the Deepseek V3 model in Cursor to generate a table of pip list, it may include versions like `1.极狐0`. Here, `极狐` refers to the Chinese GitLab platform.

* When using Deepseek or Mistral API to translate titles with prompts like `You are a professional translator. You are translating a markdown file for a Jekyll blog post from English to Chinese. {text}`, it can lead to incorrect translations. Besides the text you provide, the output often includes excessive translation.

* Though sometimes AI models in Cursor give partially correct text, we can accept them, as we can add follow-up instructions that will make the AI models regenerate the correct parts.

* Avoid providing excessive context to large language models if it's unlikely to be helpful. For example, when generating conversational dialog lines, avoid providing 100 points on a topic. Large language models already contain vast amounts of data.

* When providing ample context for tasks like translation or generating dialog lyrics, avoid using chain-of-thought features, as it can be slow and lead to verbose or unhelpful responses.

* One way to test whether a chatbot can follow a user's instructions is to ask it to explain something in English and then continue the input in Chinese, observing whether the chatbot maintains its output in English.

* Instead of providing context to LLMs, finetune a model based on a large dataset of text or code, and then use the finetuned model.
