* Copy example code into Cursor, and use comments to provide context.

* In the Hong Kong region, it is acceptable to use DeepSeek or Mistral services, while it is not acceptable to use ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

* The API policy of a region is approximately the same as its app policy.

* Use Cursor instead of Visual Studio Code, though for git merge editor cases, I still have to use `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`.

* Starting the day from Deepseek V3 release, we don't need to sunbscribe any AI tools.

* Use Gemini or Grok to generate festival celebration images with prompts like "Generate a happy Lunar Snake New Year image with text names included".
