title: Prefer to Have Background Sound
---

* Prefer to have background sound, regardless of what you're doing.

* Play a podcast, YouTube videos, or music.

* Alternate between left and right earbuds to give your ears a rest.

* Focus or distraction isn't determined solely by whether you have background sound. There are times when there's no sound, but you still find yourself distracted.

* Try having background sound consistently for a few months.

* For language learning, it can be especially helpful.

* It's like being in a classroom—while you focus on the board, there are background sounds from the teacher and other students. The effectiveness of your learning depends on your engagement.
