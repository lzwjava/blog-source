### Using a Car Vent to Dry Hair

When I was recently traveling, I forgot to dry my hair before leaving the hotel one day. It was a rainy day, and even after a few hours, my hair was still wet. I felt uncomfortable.  

I considered going to a nearby hotel, paying the staff a small fee, and asking to use a hairdryer. Alternatively, I could drive back to the hotel for half an hour just to dry my hair.  

Then, suddenly, I thought, "Why don’t I use the car’s air system to dry it?" I went to my car—a Neta electric car—turned on the heat, and set it to level 7. I lowered my head close to the vent. Soon, my hair was dry.

This became one of the happiest moments of my trip.  

### Washing Hands in a Washing Machine

When my mother is cleaning the toilet, I can’t use the sink. Instead, I use the washing machine to wash my hands by opening it, starting a program, washing my hands, and then closing it.

The washing machine’s top-loading water inlet makes it convenient for hand washing.
