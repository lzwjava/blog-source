## Runway

[https://runwayml.com](https://runwayml.com)

I uploaded a small video to Runway. The platform warns that videos be at least **620x620 pixels** in size.

I uploaded a video with a resolution of **1280x720 pixels**, featuring Apple's "Think Different" ads. Runway provided an option for a **768x1280** resolution output.

To get a **1280x768** output, the video needs to be taller.

**Prompt:** Make it more colorful

**Result:**  

<video width="384" height="640" controls>  
  <source src="{{ '/assets/videos/rrc/colorful.mp4' | relative_url }}" type="video/mp4">  
  Your browser does not support the video tag.  
</video>
