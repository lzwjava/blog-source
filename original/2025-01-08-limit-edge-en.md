title: Limits and Edge Cases
---

* Thinking about limits and edge cases is a good way to understand something.

* Knowing the limits and edge cases of a person helps you understand how to collaborate with them or live with them.

* Knowing the limits and edge cases of an API server helps you assess its security level and capabilities.

* Knowing the limits and edge cases of an input field helps you determine whether it is secure and free from bugs.

* Thinking about the limits and edge cases of an algorithm can improve efficiency and fix bugs.

* The limit is about efficiency, maximum capacity, and resources. Edge cases are about minor or niche conditions.

* The term "limit" is sometimes used to refer to edge cases, and edge cases are sometimes called limits.

* Think about limits in terms of space, size, length, number, weight, derivatives, time, lifespan, energy, frequency, physical units, computer units, requests, frequency, rate limits, resources, CPU, memory, and computation capacity.

* Consider edge cases in algorithms, code, hardware, math problems, large language models, APIs, systems, books, functionalities, or products.

* Limits often involve numerical values or constraints, while edge cases are specific, often unusual, conditions.

* Think about the limits of rendering lines of text in a browser. Is it feasible to handle one million lines? What are the constraints?

* It says the projector can work at least 1.5 meters away. What will happen if it is closer?
