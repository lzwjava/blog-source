Just like resolving computer crashes or phone lags, restarting can resolve most issues. Pure electric vehicles can be viewed as large electronic devices, with all electronic systems and the main power supply managed by a small battery in the engine compartment.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Restart Your Electric Vehicle

### 1. Disconnect the Small Battery

First, you need to use a wrench to disconnect the negative terminal of the small battery. This small battery is responsible for supplying power to all electronic systems and the main unit of your vehicle.

### 2. Wait for 5 Minutes

Keep the negative terminal disconnected for about 5 minutes. This allows the vehicle's onboard system to be completely powered off, ensuring a full reset.

### 3. Reconnect the Battery

After waiting, tighten the negative terminal of the small battery back in place. This restores the power supply to the vehicle's electronic systems.

### 4. Restart the Vehicle

With the battery reconnected, the vehicle's system can be considered "restarted." All settings and detections will be restored to their initial values. Now, try starting the vehicle again. In most cases, this should resolve any issues, and your vehicle should start up smoothly.

## Specific Case: Neta V Chao 400 Lite

For instance, the Neta V Chao 400 Lite might encounter a situation where it cannot charge when the battery is at 0%. In such cases, performing the steps mentioned above can help reset the system. This method ensures that all electronic systems are rebooted, potentially resolving the charging issue.

## Conclusion

By following these simple steps, you can effectively restart your electric vehicle, similar to rebooting a computer or smartphone. This method can resolve many system issues, ensuring that your vehicle runs smoothly. Always keep safety in mind and, if you're unsure, consult your vehicle's manual or seek professional help.

## Battling Charging Problems with My Electric Car

*2023.09.14*

I fully charged my car in Zogang, which has a range of 400km on a full charge. I began my drive to Markam, a distance of about 160km. At that point, the car displayed a remaining range of around 250km.

This seemed good, especially considering that Zogang is at a higher altitude than Markam. The car was descending the mountain, which usually helps conserve energy.

I remembered this because last week, when I drove from Markam to Zogang, my car stopped about 30km from Zogang. The display showed that I could still travel 280km, but in reality, I had only driven about 130km.

As we started climbing the mountain this time, I noticed the battery level dropping rapidly. I thought, "This isn’t good." However, I hoped we’d soon start descending, and I was right. But as night fell, the temperature dropped to around 5°C, and the battery drained even faster due to the cold.

It became clear that climbing uphill was the primary cause of rapid battery drain.

So, my car didn't make it to Zogang last week, and I had to call a tow truck for assistance.

When I drove back from Zogang to Markam, I kept that lesson in mind. Upon arriving in Markam, I headed straight to the Kewang charging station, which I had used many times during my journey to Tibet. However, the station was having issues at that moment, displaying a "data handshake timeout" error.

I asked the hotel clerk to restart the charging station, but the issue persisted.

I then drove to the Markam Yunqu Manor Hotel, which had only Xiaopeng charging stations, seemingly exclusive to Xiaopeng cars. Although Kewang claimed to have charging stations there, I couldn’t find any.

Frustrated, I continued my journey, but eventually, the battery ran out completely, and I was unable to charge it.

I tried all possible ways to resolve the issue, but nothing worked. I went to the hotel, and the next day, after consulting Neta customer support, we opened the front cover, manually disconnected the battery, and reconnected it to reset the system. Fortunately, this allowed the car to charge again.
