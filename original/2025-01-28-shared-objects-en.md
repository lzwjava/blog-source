## Lesson

The code exhibits an intermittent bug, manifesting inconsistently. Its sporadic nature makes it challenging to reproduce and debug effectively.

This intermittent behavior stems from the way the `translate_markdown_file` function, particularly the `translate_front_matter` function, handles shared data. These functions might be accessing and modifying shared data structures, such as dictionaries or lists, without proper synchronization.

When multiple threads access and modify the same data concurrently, it can lead to race conditions. Race conditions occur when the final state of the data depends on the unpredictable order in which threads execute. This can result in data corruption, unexpected program behavior, and the intermittent bugs you are observing.

To fix this, you should either avoid sharing mutable data between threads or use proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks, to protect shared data. In this case, the `front_matter_dict` is being modified in place, which is not thread-safe. The fix is to create a copy of the dictionary before modifying it. This is already done in the code, but it's important to understand why it's necessary.

## Context

```python
  with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=MAX_THREADS) as executor:
        futures = []
        for filename in changed_files:
            input_file = filename
            
            for lang in languages:
                
                print(f"Submitting translation job for {filename} to {lang}...")
                future = executor.submit(translate_markdown_file, input_file, os.path.join(f"_posts/{lang}", os.path.basename(filename).replace(".md", f"-{lang}.md")), lang, dry_run)
                futures.append(future)
            
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            try:
                future.result()
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"A thread failed: {e}")
```

## Before

```python
def translate_front_matter(front_matter, target_language, input_file):
    print(f"  Translating front matter for: {input_file}")
    if not front_matter:
        print(f"  No front matter found for: {input_file}")
        return ""
    try:
        front_matter_dict = {}
        if front_matter:
            front_matter_dict = yaml.safe_load(front_matter)
            print(f"  Front matter after safe_load: {front_matter_dict}")
        if 'title' in front_matter_dict:
            print(f"  Translating title: {front_matter_dict['title']}")
            if not (input_file == 'original/2025-01-11-resume-en.md' and target_language in ['zh', 'fr']):
                if isinstance(front_matter_dict['title'], str):
                    translated_title = translate_text(front_matter_dict['title'], target_language)
                    if translated_title:
                        translated_title = translated_title.strip()
                        if len(translated_title) > 300:
                            translated_title = translated_title.split('\n')[0]
                        front_matter_dict['title'] = translated_title
                        print(f"  Translated title to: {translated_title}")
                    else:
                        print(f"  Title translation failed for: {input_file}")
                else:
                    print(f"  Title is not a string, skipping translation for: {input_file}")
            else:
                print(f"  Skipping title translation for {input_file} to {target_language}")
        # Always set lang to target_language
        
        # Determine if the file is a translation
        original_lang = 'en' # Default to english
        if 'lang' in front_matter_dict:
            original_lang = front_matter_dict['lang']
        
        if target_language != original_lang:
            front_matter_dict['lang'] = target_language
            front_matter_dict['translated'] = True
            print(f"  Marked as translated to {target_language} for: {input_file}")
        else:
            front_matter_dict['translated'] = False
            print(f"  Not marked as translated for: {input_file}")
        
        
        result = "---\n" + yaml.dump(front_matter_dict, allow_unicode=True) + "---"
        print(f"  Front matter translation complete for: {input_file}")
        return result
    except yaml.YAMLError as e:
        print(f"  Error parsing front matter: {e}")
        return front_matter
