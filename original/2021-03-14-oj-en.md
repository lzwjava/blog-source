I use an online judging system for coding problems here. If you're good at English, you can use Codeforces and LeetCode. For Chinese, you can go to Bilibili and LeetCode. I use LeetCode here. I did 10 problems and optimized the program efficiency of the last problem from beating 10% of submissions to beating 99%.: Contest, Codeforces

leetcode: LeetCode (online judge for coding interviews)1. Running Sum of 1D Array

Given an array `nums`. The running sum of an array can be defined as `runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0] to nums[i])`.1. Compute the sum `s` of the list `nums` and append it to `running`.
2. Return the list `running`.

```python
class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        running = []
        s = 0
        for num in nums:
            s += num
            running.append(s)
        return running
```
