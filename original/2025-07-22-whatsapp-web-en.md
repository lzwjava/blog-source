I am happy to use WhatsApp Web today. It provided a completely new experience. I first registered for the WhatsApp app in 2019 when I needed to communicate with a software client from Glassdoor. I earned 450 euros for that project.

However, I didn’t use WhatsApp again until 2022, when I was working as a contractor at a Singaporean bank. I noticed my colleagues using the WhatsApp Business app, so I switched to it. Initially, registering an account was not easy. My phone number in China couldn’t receive the SMS verification code, but I managed to resolve the issue later.

I then used the WhatsApp Mac app for some time. However, for some reason, the login QR code wouldn’t display. As a result, I switched to using WhatsApp Web.

It’s an amazing experience. I think it’s much better than the WeChat Web experience. One reason is that I have fewer contacts on WhatsApp, which makes it faster.

I can imagine that a dedicated team has been working on it for years. I’m grateful for their efforts and can truly feel their passion for creating something valuable for the world.

To be honest, after a few days, I have to admit that it is not ideal in some cases. WhatsApp Web is slow to open, and I prefer using Telegram to share images from my iPhone to Mac.
