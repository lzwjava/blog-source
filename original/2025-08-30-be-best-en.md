- One doesn't need many words, just use simple words effectively.

- One doesn't need many prompts, just make one prompt perfect.

- One doesn't need many regional or duplicate code files, don't get impressed by large files.

- One doesn't need to try many customized agents, just make one agent perfect.

- Always start with one example, one row of data, one table, one sample, one person, one myopia case, one syndrome, one credit card, one journal, one scenario. Do it the best way first.

- If something doesn't work sometimes, fix it at the root cause, and check or test it every time. Then the problem won't continue.

- Just make one product that one loves first, then invite a small circle of friends and let them love it first. One doesn't need many users to make products good.

- One doesn't need many shallow connections. Start with one deep relationship first.

- If one makes something the best way with current technology, one is living in the future. Doing things the best way saves trouble in the long run.
