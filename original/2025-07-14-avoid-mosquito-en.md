title: Can We Prevent Mosquitoes from Entering the Car
translated: false
---

Sometimes, when I eat instant noodles in the car, there are smells inside the car. I have an electric lamp that shocks them, but that takes some time to lure them to be shocked by electricity.

Suddenly, I thought about how to avoid them next time. Could I find some places where there are not many mosquitoes and then go there? This is important because I have decided to live in my car more and sleep there more often, not just on road trips, but also on some days of the week. I need to go to the office 3 days a week according to the company's policy. If I figure out how to live in my Neta EV car, I can sleep nearby the office. So, I need to sleep two nights in the car to meet the requirement of going to the office 3 days a week and punch in on WeChat Enterprise.

Basically, mosquitoes enter my car through the windows when I open them to let the smell out. So, it is better to find some places where there are not many mosquitoes. Would it be more likely that when I drive a bit faster, it is less possible for mosquitoes to enter the car?

We can also use a net to cover the window to prevent mosquitoes from entering. Besides avoiding problems, we can think about how to fix them once they occur. Sometimes, killing mosquitoes is hard when they fly to the lower side of the car, like under the seat or around the legs, where it is hard to kill them. But if they are flying just under the big front window, it is easy to kill them. That's the open spot in the car.

It makes me think that it is easy to shoot somebody in the open ground, but it is hard to shoot somebody when there are a lot of buildings.

I tried an electric lamp. Even when I used a big power bank to power the electric lamp to surveil the mosquitoes in the car, I don't know whether I did it for a relatively short time. I could compare the effect to that in my house. In my house, the killing effect of mosquitoes by electric lamps is quite good. I have around 4 or 5 electric lamps on in my house.

We need to know the distribution of mosquitoes. In the city, there must be some places where mosquitoes are unlikely to be active.

Let me try more ways to kill them and supplement more details here later.
