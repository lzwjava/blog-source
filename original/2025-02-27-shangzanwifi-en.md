- http://shangzanwifi.com, Wi-Fi Portable Hotspot bought from JD.com for around 45 CNY.  

- I bought a one-month plan for 50 CNY to enjoy three networks: China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom.  

- Good integration with WeChat. In WeChat, you can buy a data plan. If you buy a year-long plan, it’s 29 CNY per month; if you buy a half-year plan, it’s 39 CNY per month; and if you buy a one-month plan, it’s 59 CNY per month. Each month includes 1500 GB of cellular data.  

- Requires KYC: You need to upload front and back photos of your national ID and complete face video detection. KYC is required for China Mobile and China Telecom. For the China Unicom network, it seems KYC is not required.

- It’s like a portable power bank. I haven’t tried using it to charge my phone.  

- I configured it to automatically switch networks. The network seems unstable when it’s switching between networks.  

- I’ve only used it for one day, so I need to gain more experience.  

- It helps a lot in my life and allows me to work anywhere. It’s cheaper than the cellular plan from China Telecom. I have a Google Pixel phone, which doesn’t have a SIM card, so this is really useful.

Update: After using it for some time, I decided to purchase a 1-year plan for around 360 CNY. However, I regret this decision given my circumstances. The device doesn't offer the convenience of using a mobile phone as a personal hotspot, likely due to the poor signal at my parents' house. Despite having options like China Telecom, China Mobile, and China Unicom, the signal remains inadequate. The key takeaway is to evaluate the cellular data signal in your primary usage area before making such a purchase. I tested it for about a month before committing to the plan.

Another factor is that I don't require this setup when I'm not working from my parents' house, especially with the flexibility of working from home two days a week. Both my mobile phone and the Hotspot Shangzanwifi experience poor signals there, which are similarly unreliable. Since I spend extended periods working there, I initially thought setting it up would be beneficial for times when I need to use my mobile phone.

Moreover, I frequently forget to bring it when I travel, which further limits its usefulness.

The one-year subscription makes each month cheaper. For example, if you pay 50 CNY for one month, with a 12-month subscription, you only pay 30 CNY per month. It seems like a smart deal. However, as a cost-conscious and disciplined consumer like me, I found myself using it less after two months. I still somewhat blame them for this unreasonable pricing and feel regret. I won't be buying it again next year.
