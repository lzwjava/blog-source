- http://shangzanwifi.com, Wi-Fi Portable Hotspot bought from JD.com for around 45 CNY.  

- I bought a one-month plan for 50 CNY to enjoy three networks: China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom.  

- Good integration with WeChat. In WeChat, you can buy a data plan. If you buy a year-long plan, it’s 29 CNY per month; if you buy a half-year plan, it’s 39 CNY per month; and if you buy a one-month plan, it’s 59 CNY per month. Each month includes 1500 GB of cellular data.  

- Requires KYC: You need to upload front and back photos of your national ID and complete face video detection. KYC is required for China Mobile and China Telecom. For the China Unicom network, it seems KYC is not required.

- It’s like a portable power bank. I haven’t tried using it to charge my phone.  

- I configured it to automatically switch networks. The network seems unstable when it’s switching between networks.  

- I’ve only used it for one day, so I need to gain more experience.  

- It helps a lot in my life and allows me to work anywhere. It’s cheaper than the cellular plan from China Telecom. I have a Google Pixel phone, which doesn’t have a SIM card, so this is really useful.
