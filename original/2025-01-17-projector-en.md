title: Projector Setup
---

In late August 2024, after moving back in with my parents, I found myself in a smaller room. Missing the entertainment my projector provided, I decided to relocate it from my previous residence.

I acquired a three-angle projection setup for my projector. I bought two main components separately: a three-angle stick with an integrated curtain, and a separate three-angle stand for the projector itself.

Setting up the projector was straightforward. I used the compass app on my iPhone to ensure the projector was perfectly level.

Initially, before using the projection stick with the curtain, I had placed the projector on the shelves above my bed, projecting directly onto the wall.

However, this setup required me to rotate my viewing position by approximately 90 degrees, which was inconvenient. To avoid this, I purchased the projection stick with the curtain, allowing me to project onto a more suitable surface without needing to reposition myself.
