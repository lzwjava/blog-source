- Ensure the orignal data is correct.

- Fix the root data instead of generated data.

- Use a lot of checking script to ensure data correctness.

- Check the correctness and consistency of data.

- Some data needs to be completely accurate, while other data can be approximately correct. For example, translations are acceptable even if they contain occasional typos.

- Use quantitative metrics to measure data quality.

- Wrong data will lead to more wrong data.

- Data includes numbers, strings, text, data structures, images, videos, code, files, and other information types.

- Keep original data in experiments for physics, science, and computer science.

- Data should be reproducible and repeatable.
