## Installing

I previously wrote about [How to Build a Computer](./computer-en). Let's try something different. Today, I'm installing Ubuntu 24.04 on a Lenovo Xiaoxing 14IAH8 laptop that came with Windows 10 pre-installed.

```bash
sudo dd if=ubuntu-24.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/rdisk6 bs=1m
```

It is necessary to go to settings and disable Device encryption, as the Ubuntu installer requires it.

If device encryption is enabled and secure boot is disabled in the BIOS, Windows will prompt for the BitLocker passphrase for recovery.

Therefore, it's necessary to first enable secure boot in the BIOS, log into Windows, and then go to settings to disable Device encryption. After that, secure boot can be disabled again to start the Ubuntu installer.

## Getting Stuck

When Ubuntu starts the `gdm.service` (GNOME Display Manager) and gets stuck, it typically indicates an issue with the graphical user interface (GUI) or the display manager itself. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:

1. **Access a Virtual Terminal:**
   - If your system is stuck at the GDM screen, you can try to access a terminal to diagnose the problem.
   - Press `Ctrl + Alt + F2` (or `F3`, `F4`, etc.) to switch to a virtual terminal.

2. **Log In:**
   - Log in with your username and password.

3. **Check System Logs:**
   - Use the following command to check the system logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate the cause of the issue:
     ```bash
     sudo journalctl -xe
     ```

4. **Restart the GDM Service:**
   - Attempt to restart the GDM service to see if it resolves the issue:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart gdm
     ```

5. **Reboot the System:**
   - After making changes, reboot your system to apply them:
     ```bash
     sudo reboot
     ```
