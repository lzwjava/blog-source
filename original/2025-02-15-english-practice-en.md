title: Affordable English Practice with Native Speakers
translated: false
---

Recently, I tried an English language conversation practice session with a native speaker from Pinduoduo.com.

The assistant will add your WeChat via your mobile phone number and help you arrange the course.

It's cheap, at only 18 CNY per course for about 25 minutes. The teachers are from the Phillipines. By the way, I just learned the word "Phillipinos" from this chat.

I discovered this course through a post on X and was drawn to its affordability. Despite achieving an IELTS score of 6 two years prior, my goal is to reach 7.5 this year, necessitating increased English practice, particularly in speaking and writing.

We talked about some IELTS speaking exercises. The English teacher asked me exam questions about topics like travel, photo-taking habits, and traffic jams.

Another famous platform, VIPKID, charged 150 CNY per course for 25 minutes years ago.

So, the price is really cheap here now.

I searched for Japanese conversation practice on Pinduoduo.com. Unfortunately, there are no merchants offering such a service at the moment.

I would like to take more English courses.

I bought 10 courses for 180 CNY and tried another merchant on Pinduoduo.com. I prefer to buy and compare products or services on Pinduoduo.
