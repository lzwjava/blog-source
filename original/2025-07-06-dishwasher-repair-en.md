title: Repairing Dishwasher

Recently, I moved my dishwasher from my parents' home to my home in the same city. The dishwasher is a Midea 13 Q7. I bought it in the summer of 2019 while working in Beijing. At the start of 2020, I used Deppon delivery to move it to Guangzhou.

I found a technician through AMap's home appliance repair service. I paid him 750 CNY to help repair and install it in my home. The story is a little long. We worked from 3 PM to 8 PM to finally get it working. In the middle, he went out to buy some materials.

There were two or three times when we thought it was okay. We would run a dishwashing program, but after some time, the floor would be covered in water. The first time, we found that the exhaust pipe of the dishwasher had a hole, which was quick to observe and fix. However, it still leaked water from the bottom. We used some stands to elevate the dishwasher so we could see where the water was leaking from. It was like checking a car.

We disassembled the dishwasher and checked it, finding that some inner pipes had holes. The technician used tape to patch them. Unfortunately, there was still another place with a hole, so we fixed it again.

Finally, around 8 PM, it was good. This procedure reminded me of software development. In retrospect, these issues are natural and reasonable. They were just out of our expectations but followed the principles of material and time.
