title: Multi-field EMF Meter

I recently heard rumors that 5G stations might cause harm to humans, which made me curious to investigate further. To do so, I purchased a Multi-field EMF Meter to measure electromagnetic fields. EMF stands for Electromagnetic Field.

I conducted a test to measure the EMF levels at various distances from my TP-LINK AX3000 WiFi router. Below are the results. [^1]

The EMF meter has three modes to test: magnetic field, electric field, and radio frequency. For the WiFi router testing, we used the radio frequency mode.

Moving a mobile phone upward or downward can generate a magnetic field, which an EMF (Electromagnetic Field) meter can detect.
