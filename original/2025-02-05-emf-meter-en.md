title: Multi-field EMF Meter

I recently heard rumors that 5G stations might cause harm to humans, which made me curious to investigate further. To do so, I purchased a Multi-field EMF Meter to measure electromagnetic fields. EMF stands for Electromagnetic Field.

I conducted a test to measure the EMF levels at various distances from my TP-LINK AX3000 WiFi router. Below are the results. [^1]

The EMF meter has three modes to test: magnetic field, electric field, and radio frequency. For the WiFi router testing, we used the radio frequency mode.

Moving a mobile phone upward or downward can generate a magnetic field, which an EMF (Electromagnetic Field) meter can detect. [^2]

My initial experiments suggest that the radio frequency levels in my immediate surroundings are quite low, indicating a safe environment. This is likely due to my living in an apartment complex nestled under a mountain, resulting in poor 4G and 5G signal reception. Further testing in various locations is needed to draw broader conclusions.

A low measurement of electromagnetic fields at one point in time does not guarantee consistently low levels. It's possible that the measurements could be higher on other days.
