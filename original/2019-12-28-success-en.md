title: 'Yin Wang: On So-Called Success'

Many people, unable to tolerate the online ridicule directed at me, have offered advice like this: *"First, take down those traditional internet companies whose founders are aging. Once you become a 'success,' even a casual post will earn you flattery. Many won’t listen to you now, but once you dominate, they’ll submit."*

These people fundamentally misunderstand my values and philosophy. They haven’t absorbed the essence of my words, so they fixate on the insults and urge me to play the "success" game by society’s rules.

The so-called "success" recognized by the Chinese public is a trap. If you chase it, you become their slave—controlled by their standards, their validation. Those who crave external approval and conform to mainstream "success" are nothing but slaves. I don’t care about their opinions.

Why do so many Chinese obsess over "success" and comparison? Because they’re conditioned to be graded. From childhood—by parents, teachers, exams, rankings—they’ve never learned to evaluate the world from their own perspective or question the authority of those who judge them. Who gave these judges the right?

After school, the grading continues—by bosses, colleagues, public opinion, partners, even in-laws. Chinese "success" is just another scorecard. The graded are always inferior to the graders. Those desperate for others to call them "successful" are, in truth, servile.

I’ve long despised anyone who tries to grade me. I never saw competition organizers as worthy of evaluating me, so I stopped participating in contests (ACM, IOI, etc.) in college. Now, when I see such events, I laugh at the caliber of their hosts, judges, and problem-setters. Of course, I care even less about whether others deem me "successful."

**I define my own success.**

Would I be satisfied if people flattered or submitted to me just because I had money or status? No. I care about genuine respect—whether someone admires me from the heart, not just performs for my approval. When the wealthy or powerful spout nonsense and attract sycophants or media praise, it doesn’t fulfill me. I despise flatterers; they disgust me.

I don’t need "success" to force submission. I have my own standards. I do what fulfills me and attract those who share my values. I ignore mainstream tastes—they often signal mediocrity.

If I chased conventional "success" just to demand flattery, I’d be no different from the very "successful" people I criticize. It’s like saying, *"Get rich, become a billionaire, and women will fawn over you."* That’s not what I want. I seek kindred spirits who truly respect me, not opportunistic leeches.

Are those publicly celebrated "successful" people truly successful? Many famous internet companies—do they even turn a profit? They just churn out garbage information. I urge people to study their balance sheets, their business models, their *real* societal value. Most are bubbles—toxins that, when burst, poison the economy and harm everyone.

If I sold my integrity, I’d be "successful" by now. But my definition differs. I don’t care about mainstream "success" because those people can’t articulate a single insightful idea. Many are societal tumors. I refuse to become one.

Even a decade ago, when I left Tsinghua, I had "fame." Some valued my blog highly based on "attention economy" metrics. But I never leveraged that fame for money or status. I used it to spread ideas I believe in. I can’t be bought or exploited.

In every job, I earned my keep through skill. Every line of code I wrote, every word I spoke, created real value. Of course, office politics wasted some energy, but much of it honed my ability to read people.

During periods when my bank account was empty and I lived off credit cards, I never considered selling out. Multiple times, people waved money at me: *"Join us, lend your name to our site, and we’ll all get rich!"* I took one look at their faces and refused. When I learned they were engaged in unethical schemes, I cut them off.

Sadly, I’ve seen many "successful" people—executives, senior engineers, even Ivy League professors—succumb to money, endorsing vulgar, manipulative figures. Some were once respectable in my eyes, but their choices destroyed that image. To the uncritical, they’re "successful." To me, they’re trash.

I’ve said it before: **My words carry their own weight.** I don’t need "success" or money to persuade others. Some tell me, *"Do something big, and they’ll shut up."* But no—even the most "successful" face endless criticism. Online, many mock and insult me. But look at who they are, their caliber, the nonsense they spout. It’s all noise. I don’t care.

People will *never* shut up, no matter how "successful" you are. A billionaire taking a walk can still encounter a thug hurling insults. Do you waste time trying to convince them? No. You ignore them.

A philosopher once said: *"Wisdom can never defeat stupidity; you can only wait for the stupid to die."* Exactly. The ignorant will never recognize your "success." Even if you meet their standards, they’ll still claim you’ve failed, still spread rumors.

I write for those who *want* to read me—for the honest and kind. I don’t try to convince my detractors. My audience is high-quality people. The rest? Treat them like street thugs. Ignore them.

The worst mistake is chasing mainstream "success." Otherwise, you’re controlled by the foolish. Many don’t realize how many people *do* support me; they only see the loud, low-quality naysayers.

I advise my followers: Read my blog and social media. Avoid forums—they’re cesspools of low-quality discourse. If someone spends all day on forums, imagine how empty their real life must be—no real friends to meet for tea or conversation?

Many young engineers, researchers, even professors grew up reading my work. I don’t need "success" or money to inspire them. My words resonate directly with their hearts. These people will grow stronger and more principled than those who ignore or mock me. Then you’ll see where *true* value lies.
