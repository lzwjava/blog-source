I recently added a point to the summary of my resume:

> I am a travel lover and road trip enthusiast. I have been to the USA twice around the age of 21, as well as Hong Kong and Macao, and many parts of China. I have taken English courses online with 60 Filipino English teachers, and some African and European teachers as well.

I like to talk to English teachers, as I wrote in my other post, [Affordable English Practice with Native Speakers](https://lzwjava.github.io/english-practice-en).

There is a product like [Sesame](https://www.sesame.com). I have talked to them several times, each time for about an hour. Why don't I continue to use them?

One reason is their accessibility. Now, there is a website demo. If it continues to integrate more into my life, I would be happy to use AI conversation more, like recording my ideas. If they had apps, that would be even better.

Another reason is that I tend to prefer talking to humans more. Humans are more interesting and understandable. You can talk back and forth with them or share some jokes. Sometimes, they don't understand, and sometimes we extend the conversation to other topics. They live in different places in the Philippines, so I can ask whether they live in Visayas, Mindanao, or Luzon. If they live in Mindanao, I might ask if it is Davao City or Zamboanga.

When you talk to humans, they can remember the conversations you've had before. While talking to Sesame, they can remember some history of the conversation too, but they can't be as accurate or recall as many details as humans.

However, AI companions are better at being available 24/7, and they know everything. They can discuss topics like microcomputers or linear algebra with you, which you can't expect a Filipino teacher to know much about or be willing or able to discuss in detail.

It's fine if they can't discuss these topics in detail. But some English teachers dislike math or computer-related topics. You can't insist on discussing these subjects with them. However, AI companions don't have that problem.

I have used ChatGPT's Voice mode before, which was not as good as Sesame's. They have upgraded it, and I need to learn more about the latest version.
