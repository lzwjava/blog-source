* Around January 2025, my 3.5-year-old daughter used the iPad one day and said she had taken photos of me. This was her first time using the Camera App.

* Around January 2025, she used a microscope to look at me and said that she saw two of me.

* She gets excited when doing things for the first time.

* Watch youtube kids a lot.

* My daughter could sing "Baby Shark" and "Happy Birthday" at 2.5 years old.
