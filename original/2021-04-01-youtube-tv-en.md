title: How to Watch YouTube on TV
type: post

This guide assumes you already have a way to bypass geo-restrictions. Here’s how to watch YouTube on your TV without flashing custom firmware on your router—just use an app.

## **SmartYouTubeTV**

1. **Download and Install**:
  Download the app and sideload it onto your TV using a USB drive.

2. **Configure Proxy**:
  - On your proxy client (e.g., Clash), enable **"Allow connections from LAN"** to permit local network devices to route traffic through your machine.
  - In **SmartYouTubeTV**, navigate to settings and enter your proxy details (e.g., `192.168.1.3:7890`).
    *Note*: Use **SOCKS5** (HTTP proxies failed in testing). Replace `192.168.1.3` with your machine’s local IP.

3. **Test and Confirm**:
  Click **"Test"** in the app to verify connectivity. If successful, save the settings and start streaming.

## **gfreezy/seeker (Transparent Proxy)**
A GitHub project that turns your computer into a proxy gateway using **TUN** (similar to Surge’s enhanced/gateway modes). Below are key notes and a working config:

### **Configuration (`config.yml`)**
```yml
verbose: true
dns_start_ip: 10.0.0.10
dns_servers:
  - 223.5.5.5:53
  - 114.114.114.114:53
dns_timeout: 1s
tun_name: utun4
tun_ip: 10.0.0.1
tun_cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
dns_listen: 0.0.0.0:53
gateway_mode: true
ping_timeout: 2s
probe_timeout: 30ms
connect_timeout: 1s
read_timeout: 30s
write_timeout: 5s
max_connect_errors: 2

servers:
  - name: http proxy server
   addr: 0.0.0.0:7890
   protocol: Http
  - name: https proxy server
   addr: 0.0.0.0:7890
   protocol: Https

rules:
  - 'MATCH,PROXY'
```

### **Why Not SOCKS5?**
Initially, I tried SOCKS5:
```yml
servers:
  - name: socks5 proxy server
   addr: 0.0.0.0:7891
   protocol: Socks5
```
But it caused **connection loops** (per the [docs](https://github.com/gfreezy/seeker)), requiring explicit direct-connection rules for domains. **HTTP/HTTPS proxies** were more stable.

### **Trade-offs**
- **Seeker**: Requires a dedicated machine acting as a router.
- **Proxy Mode (SmartYouTubeTV)**: Flexible—works with phones/tablets sharing a proxy port.

## **TV Screenshots (Xiaomi TV)**
To capture screenshots:
1. **Double-press the `Home` button** on the remote to open the app manager.
2. Select the **screenshot button** and share via WeChat (or other apps).
3. Use this menu to **force-close frozen apps**.

Enjoy the big-screen experience!

## **Update (September 2025)**

Apple TV now supports VPN software natively. You can install **Shadowrocket** to connect to your proxy server and stream YouTube TV directly.
