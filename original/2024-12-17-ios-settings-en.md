## Per-App Settings

While using Reddit more frequently, I found the font size too small for comfortable reading. The app suggested adjusting the font size through Per-App Settings. After increasing it slightly, Reddit became much easier to use. Below are the screenshots showing the settings adjustments:

## Switch Control and AssistiveTouch

In 2019, I began using my iPhone more actively, especially for watching TikTok videos. However, when my phone was mounted in a lazy bracket, it became difficult to reach the screen and swipe between videos. To solve this, I bought a Bluetooth remote control handle that works with both iOS and Android devices.

In 2022, I purchased another remote control handle specifically for controlling my iPhone while driving. With one hand on the steering wheel, I can effortlessly use the other hand to navigate apps, adjust settings, or control media playback with the handle’s up and down buttons.

This remote control handle is not only great for managing TikTok but also versatile enough for taking selfies and controlling other iPhone functions, adding both convenience and safety to my driving experience.

## Slide to Update

The update method used by OKX is fascinating. Users need to slide to initiate an update.
