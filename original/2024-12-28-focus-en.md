title: Silence Can Make You Sleepy
---

I recently tried to focus on reading learning materials on my computer while using earplugs to block out the noise of other family members talking. However, I soon found myself feeling sleepy. Confused, I turned to DeepSeek for an explanation. Here’s what it said:

> Using earplugs to block out noise, maintaining a silent environment, and engaging in calm activities like watching a still computer screen or reading a book can make it easier to fall asleep. These activities help reduce external distractions and promote relaxation, which can prepare your mind and body for sleep. However, it’s important to avoid overly stimulating content (e.g., intense movies or bright screens) before bed, as this can have the opposite effect. Instead, opt for calming or monotonous activities to encourage drowsiness.

So, no wonder! The very same techniques that create a peaceful environment for sleep can also make it harder to stay alert while studying.  

### What Can You Do Instead?  
If you’re trying to focus but find yourself getting drowsy, here are a few tips:  
1. Take Short Breaks: Stand up, stretch, or move around to re-energize.  
2. Adjust Your Environment: Let in some natural light or use a brighter lamp to stay alert.  
3. Engage Actively: Try summarizing what you’re reading or taking notes to keep your mind active.  
4. Limit Earplug Use: If silence makes you sleepy, consider soft background music or white noise instead.  

Finding the right balance between focus and relaxation can take some experimentation, but with these adjustments, you can stay productive without nodding off!  

### Why Some Activities Keep You Focused  
This also explains why I find it easier to focus when writing my blog or coding on my laptop. These activities require typing, which involves actively interacting with the computer. This engagement keeps my mind alert and prevents drowsiness, unlike passive activities like reading or watching a still screen.  

### Why I Keep Repeating This Mistake  
Despite having experienced this issue before, I still find myself falling into the same trap. The reason? I haven’t formed a new habit. When the surroundings get noisy, my first impulse is to reach for earplugs. Previously, I thought the problem was my ability to focus—that it was somehow my fault. I wasn’t aware that this is a common experience for many people.  

Now that I understand the science behind it, I’m working on breaking this cycle by experimenting with alternative strategies, like using background music or taking more active breaks. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the solution isn’t about forcing yourself to focus harder but about creating the right conditions for your brain to thrive.
