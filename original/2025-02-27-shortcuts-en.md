### Shortcuts Tips

- Use the Shortcuts app to create a shortcut that triggers when you arrive at the office. This shortcut will automatically open the WeCom app, enabling you to punch in.

- When using a Macao SIM card as a cellular network, you don’t need a VPN to access global networks. However, it becomes inconvenient to switch to a VPN when connecting to Wi-Fi. Shortcuts can help with this.

- You can use shortcuts to notify you to play basketball or do other activities.

- Shortcuts are great for notifications that are helpful to have but not essential if they’re missing.

- Use shortcuts to remind you to pay your mortgage, monthly credit bills, or register for exams.

### Wallpaper Changer Shortcut for iOS

[https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f972a5bc6f9c43109f7461465b4be2ee](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f972a5bc6f9c43109f7461465b4be2ee)

This shortcut changes the wallpaper on iOS. I have been using it for months, and it works wonderfully. On specific days of the week, at 3:14 PM, this shortcut automatically runs on my iPhone. It is simple and effective. It downloads an image from Unsplash and sets it as the wallpaper. Note that you need to install the Unsplash app first.

Using a similar method is often better than buying or purchasing a wallpaper application to do so.

I learned about setting a reminder for 3:14 PM from Andrej Karpathy, who used this time to capture a photo at that moment.
