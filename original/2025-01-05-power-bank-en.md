## Forgetfulness about Charging Power Banks

The problem of often forgetting to charge power banks has been frustrating me.

I have two small electric lamps that I've been using recently. I had two power banks a week ago and I have three mobile phones. I was frustrated to find that both of my power banks were out of electricity, so I bought a third one.

I was initially happy to have three power banks, but the happiness didn't last long. Today, I found that all three of my power banks were out of electricity, and I needed one to charge my iPhone 14 Pro Max.

Why did this happen?

The reason is that I often forget to charge them after using them. Regardless of how many power banks I buy, if I don't charge one after using it, I will eventually deplete all of them.

The first power bank is a Ugreen MagSafe wireless power bank with a 10,000 mAh capacity. The second and third ones are power banks with built-in cables, both also with 10,000 mAh capacities.

When they are all fully charged, I have 30,000 mAh of portable electricity. If I use some of them, I need to recharge them to maintain a considerable amount of power.

But why do I forget to charge them? It's similar to being lazy about washing dishes after a meal, even though it just means putting the dishes in the dishwasher.

Charging the power bank is very easy. I just need to stand up from my reclining pillow and walk one meter away to plug it in.

It's not about the effort or energy. In many cases, I just don't want anything to interrupt my activities like writing blogs, chatting with AI chatbots, or writing code.

Recently, I bought a power strip to help charge my Mac laptop as I work in bed, since there are no sockets nearby.

So, my solution is to use that power strip to charge my three phones as well. This way, I can use the power banks less frequently if I don't want to charge them. A power strip has sockets in it, so it's like having sockets near the bed.

Another solution is to use the Shortcuts app in iOS to set a notification to remind me to check or charge the power banks at a certain time each day.

By the way, I thought of a new kind of charging method: a [Smart Universal Charger Box](./charger-box-en). I introduced it in another article. Actually, this is a different problem. It is about how to charge, not about solving the issue of forgetting to charge power banks.

People can invent a charger box. This box is like ultrasonic cleaner. When I used up a power bank, I just put it in the charger box. Then after few hours, the power bank is fully charged.

This is really interesting. May be the electric portable products in home can all implement some protocal to let them charge wirelessly. And they are all connected to cloud's server. And there is a charger box. You just need to put bluetooth speakers, mobile phones, electric lamps, laptop to the box, smart watches to the big charger box. Then they can be charged up. It is like smart cashier machine in big supermarkets.

Just like wireless power bank can passed the energy to the iPhones, the charger box can pass energy from it to the electric products inside it. It is like Magsafe charger.
