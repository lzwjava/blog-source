Which one is better? Apparently, the first one is better because it implies that not just I, or he, or she, but everyone needs to rename the file in this situation.

It also suggests that human labor may not be necessary—this task can potentially be handled by code or machines.

The second version is more direct, stating things plainly. However, we should aim to express things from an objective perspective rather than from our own point of view. Adjusting our expressions in every situation can be challenging.

Regarding the above, I used "we" here. However, it's not just "we"—the code or machine can handle this task as well. Therefore, it is better written as: "Our expression should be adjusted from our point of view to the objective view."

Do not focus on human beings. Just observe how things should work objectively.

When referring to people, it's often better to mention a specific individual rather than a group, community, or nationality. Avoid labeling people; instead, describe their actions or behaviors.

In professional contexts, use titles instead of names to emphasize roles and responsibilities. The actions and mindset should reflect the position, not the individual.
