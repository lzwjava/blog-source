## PyTorch

Let's install it. This supports Python version `3.9`.

```shell
$ pip install torch torchvision

```

Let's verify it.

```python
import torch
x = torch.rand(5, 3)
print(x)
```

An error occurred.

```shell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "torch.py", line 1, in <module>
    import torch
  File "torch.py", line 2, in <module>
    x = torch.rand(5, 3)
AttributeError: partially initialized module 'torch' has no attribute 'rand' (most likely due to a circular import)
```

After googling this error message, it turns out our file was also named `torch`, causing a naming conflict. After renaming it, it works correctly.

```shell
tensor([[0.5520, 0.9446, 0.5543],
        [0.6192, 0.0908, 0.8726],
        [0.0223, 0.7685, 0.9814],
        [0.4019, 0.5406, 0.3861],
        [0.5485, 0.6040, 0.2387]])
```

Let's find an example.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import torch
import math
dtype = torch.float
device = torch.device("cpu")
# device = torch.device("cuda:0") # Uncomment this to run on GPU

# Create random input and output data
x = torch.linspace(-math.pi, math.pi, 2000, device=device, dtype=dtype)
y = torch.sin(x)

# Randomly initialize weights
a = torch.randn((), device=device, dtype=dtype)
b = torch.randn((), device=device, dtype=dtype)
c = torch.randn((), device=device, dtype=dtype)
d = torch.randn((), device=device, dtype=dtype)

learning_rate = 1e-6
for t in range(2000):
    # Forward pass: compute predicted y
    y_pred = a + b * x + c * x ** 2 + d * x ** 3

    # Compute and print loss
    loss = (y_pred - y).pow(2).sum().item()
    if t % 100 == 99:
        print(t, loss)

    # Backprop to compute gradients of a, b, c, d with respect to loss
    grad_y_pred = 2.0 * (y_pred - y)
    grad_a = grad_y_pred.sum()
    grad_b = (grad_y_pred * x).sum()
    grad_c = (grad_y_pred * x ** 2).sum()
    grad_d = (grad_y_pred * x ** 3).sum()

    # Update weights using gradient descent
    a -= learning_rate * grad_a
    b -= learning_rate * grad_b
    c -= learning_rate * grad_c
    d -= learning_rate * grad_d
print(f'Result: y = {a.item()} + {b.item()} x + {c.item()} x^2 + {d.item()} x^3')
```

Let's run it.

```shell

```

Let's look at code using only the `numpy` library.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import numpy as np
import math

# Create random input and output data
x = np.linspace(-math.pi, math.pi, 2000)
y = np.sin(x)

# Randomly initialize weights
a = np.random.randn()
b = np.random.randn()
c = np.random.randn()
d = np.random.randn()

learning_rate = 1e-6
for t in range(2000):
    # Forward pass: compute predicted y
    # y = a + b x + c x^2 + d x^3
    y_pred = a + b * x + c * x ** 2 + d * x ** 3

    # Compute and print loss
    loss = np.square(y_pred - y).sum()
    if t % 100 == 99:
        print(t, loss)

    # Backprop to compute gradients of a, b, c, d with respect to loss
    grad_y_pred = 2.0 * (y_pred - y)
    grad_a = grad_y_pred.sum()
    grad_b = (grad_y_pred * x).sum()
    grad_c = (grad_y_pred * x ** 2).sum()
    grad_d = (grad_y_pred * x ** 3).sum()

    # Update weights
    a -= learning_rate * grad_a
    b -= learning_rate * grad_b
    c -= learning_rate * grad_c
    d -= learning_rate * grad_d

print(f'Result: y = {a} + {b} x + {c} x^2 + {d} x^3')
```

Notice that these are two different ways to perform calculations.

In these examples, a set of x and y values is first generated. Then, it's assumed to be a cubic equation. Next, some methods are used to iteratively calculate the coefficients. What are these algorithms? Notice that it loops `2000` times, becoming more precise with each iteration. We won't delve into the details here.

## Finally

Currently, we don't understand how machine learning calculations work behind the scenes. However, that's not important for now. With the knowledge above, we can already do many things. Machine learning can also be used to process text, audio, and more. After exploring dozens of examples, it won't be too late to learn the theory.
