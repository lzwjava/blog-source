* Focus at work doesn't always happen as you might expect. Surprisingly, noisy or interrupted environments, like when babysitting children, can sometimes boost productivity. Your mood and mental state significantly influence your ability to concentrate, much like how they affect sleep quality.

* The main dilemma of the world is that knowledge and invention are increasing, however, our focus and study are becoming harder. Most days, it's challenging to sit down and read books or watch courses. You can't force yourself to focus, just like you can't force yourself to fall asleep.

* To address this, I like to walk and drive a lot while listening to lectures or watching videos. Covering 10,000 kilometers and walking 5,000 steps every day has helped me become fluent in English and pass the IELTS exam. Now, I hope it can also help me learn math and AI. The key is to avoid mobile phone distractions and remain calm. I encourage others to try this method and provide me with feedback.

* Have fun and work on your own projects often.

* Experiment with different approaches to find what comes naturally to you. Pay attention to what actually works in practice rather than wishful thinking. Trust your instincts and physical responses as reliable indicators.

* The ways people read, write, or code vary significantly. Personally, I often prefer printing papers to read them.

* Less is more. Smaller, focused teams in companies often outperform larger teams, even when the larger teams have 10x or 100x more people, due to better communication and coordination.

* I read parts of "The Mythical Man-Month" by Fred Brooks. Its principles about software project management remain relevant in the long term.

* No productivity method works automatically - you need to experiment and adapt techniques to find what works best for your specific needs.

* Use urges to do things. Don't force yourself. Always do what you want at the moment. This is fulfilling.

* Use code or other tools to automate tasks, allowing you to focus on the most interesting aspects.
