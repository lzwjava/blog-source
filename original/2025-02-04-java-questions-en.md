### Java Core

1. What are the four main principles of OOP in Java? Answer: The four main principles are Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object, Inheritance allows class inheritance, Polymorphism enables method overriding and overloading, and Abstraction provides a way to represent essential features without including background details.

2. Explain the purpose of generics in Java and provide an example. Answer: Generics allow types to be parameterized, enabling code reusability and type safety. For example, `ArrayList<T>` uses a type parameter `T` to store elements of any type.

3. How do you create a thread in Java, and what is its lifecycle? Answer: You can create a thread by extending `Thread` or implementing `Runnable`. The lifecycle includes New, Runnable, Running, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting, and Terminated states.

4. Describe the different memory areas managed by the JVM. Answer: The JVM manages the Heap, Stack, Method Area, Native Method Stack, and Program Counter Register. The Heap stores objects, while each thread has its own Stack for local variables and method calls.

5. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java? Answer: Checked exceptions must be declared or caught, while unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile time. Examples include `IOException` for checked and `NullPointerException` for unchecked.

6. How do you implement serialization in Java, and why is it important? Answer: Serialization is implemented by implementing the `Serializable` interface. It's important for saving and restoring the state of an object, useful in networking and persistence.

7. Compare ArrayList and LinkedList in Java Collections Framework. Answer: `ArrayList` is suitable for fast access and traversal, while `LinkedList` is better for insertions and deletions. `ArrayList` uses contiguous memory, whereas `LinkedList` uses nodes with pointers.

8. What are lambda expressions in Java, and how do they relate to functional interfaces? Answer: Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent one method interface (functional interfaces). They are used for implementing functional interfaces like `Runnable` or `Comparator`.

9. Explain the key operations available in Java Stream API. Answer: Stream API includes intermediate operations (e.g., `map`, `filter`) and terminal operations (e.g., `forEach`, `collect`). They allow for functional-style operations on collections.

10. How do you use reflection in Java to inspect classes at runtime? Answer: Reflection allows inspection of classes, methods, and fields using `Class.forName()`, `getMethods()`, and `getField()`. It's used for dynamic behavior and frameworks.
