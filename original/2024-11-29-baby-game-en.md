This is a simple game I play with my baby to interact and amuse them.

### How to Play

1. Lie down next to your baby so they can see your face
2. Move your hand slowly near their face
3. Move your head following your hand movement
4. Smile and make eye contact when they look at you
5. Repeat in different directions

### Tips

- Keep movements gentle and slow
- Use soft voices and smiles
- Play when baby is happy and alert
- A few minutes is enough

The illustrations above show how to play - simply move your head following your hand while maintaining eye contact and smiling at your baby.

This easy activity is perfect for playtime or during daily care routines.

## Predict Next Body States

*2024.11.28*

If we accumulate data about body state, such as the degree of myopia, weight, and all parameters of a normal physical examination, and then train an AI model on this data, we can predict future body states, similar to predicting the next token in a sequence.

We can also record information about the air we breathe, the food we eat, and how our bodies interact with the physical world to understand the causal relationships between these factors and health outcomes. For example, excessive sugar consumption can lead to diabetes.

This approach can help people live longer, healthier lives by enabling them to make informed decisions and take preventive measures.

During a recent basketball practice session, I discovered an innovative variation of the traditional bounce pass that introduces an unexpected element of misdirection to the game. This technique involves striking the ball forcefully against the court at a precise angle, causing it to ricochet high into the air and soar over the defender's head before descending to your teammate.

The unconventional nature of this pass can momentarily catch defenders off guard, creating opportunities for your team. The ball's unexpected trajectory forces defenders to adjust their positioning, potentially opening up new passing lanes and scoring opportunities.

However, like any basketball move, this technique comes with its trade-offs. The extended path the ball must travel makes it slower than a conventional direct pass. The additional bounce also increases the risk of interception, as alert defenders can potentially disrupt the ball's path or take advantage of its predictable trajectory.

While this creative passing technique shouldn't replace traditional passes in your arsenal, it can be an effective surprise element when used strategically. I've found that mixing it into regular gameplay occasionally not only adds an element of fun but can also create genuine tactical advantages when defenders least expect it.

Through experimenting with moves like this, I've learned that basketball constantly evolves through innovation. While not every creative attempt becomes a game-changing technique, the process of exploring new possibilities keeps the sport exciting and unpredictable.

Remember: The key to successfully incorporating any unconventional move is knowing when to deploy it. Use this bounce pass variation selectively, and always prioritize making the smart play over the flashy one.
