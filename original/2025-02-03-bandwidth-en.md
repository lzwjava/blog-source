I'm using an Aliyun server in Hong Kong with a post-paid, Pay-By-Traffic elastic IP. However, I'm experiencing speeds below what I expect. My current bandwidth is:

* Download: 93.82 Mbps
* Upload: 56.98 Mbps

The consistently low bandwidth, below 100 Mbps, indicates a bottleneck. This could stem from a physical cable limitation or a software-imposed restriction. I will investigate further to identify the cause and achieve higher bandwidth.

For comparison, using 5G cellular data with China Telecom, I observed:

* Download: 231 Mbps
* Upload: 62.6 Mbps

This suggests the bottleneck is likely related to the cable or home broadband connection.
