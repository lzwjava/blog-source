title: Investigating 200M Bandwidth Limit
translated: false
---

I'm using an Aliyun server in Hong Kong with a post-paid, Pay-By-Traffic elastic IP. However, I'm experiencing speeds below what I expect. My current bandwidth is:

- Download: 93.82 Mbps
- Upload: 56.98 Mbps

The fact that the bandwidth is consistently below 100 Mbps suggests a bottleneck somewhere, possibly a physical cable limitation or a software-imposed limit. I will be investigating this further to find a solution to achieve higher bandwidth.
