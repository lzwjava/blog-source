title: Set Up Your Proxy Server
type: post
---

* To set up a server, use Outline Manager: [https://getoutline.org](https://getoutline.org).  

* Recommended hosting providers include DigitalOcean, Google Cloud, Amazon Lightsail, Azure, Vultr, and Linode. For optimal performance, choose server locations in Singapore or Tokyo. While Hong Kong is also a viable option, be aware that certain AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude are restricted in that region.

* You can still use tools like Deepseek, Mistral, Grok, and the Gemini API (through Cursor) with Hong Kong servers. Using reverse thinking, since others may avoid Hong Kong servers, they tend to be less congested.

* Consider server location and distance. For those in Guangzhou, Hong Kong is a good option for hosting a proxy server. Use Speedtest to measure network speed.

* For optimal speed, I recommend using an Aliyun Hong Kong server with a BGP (premium) elastic IP. The elastic IP feature allows quick replacement if the current IP gets blocked. Aliyun Cloud's optimized BGP (premium) connection ensures fast performance. The service costs 3CNY per 1GB of traffic.

* Protocols such as Shadowsocks, VMess, and Trojan can easily get banned.  

* Linode's IP Transfer feature allows you to quickly migrate your server to a new location, thus obtaining a new IP address.

* You may need a script to automatically renew your server every day.  

* If the proxy server gets banned by the GFW or encounters other issues, you can use a China Telecom Macau SIM card to share cellular data with your laptop. This allows you to set up a new server.  

* For cloud services like Google Cloud Platform, configuring a new server requires an existing proxy server. However, providers like DigitalOcean or Vultr can be set up directly without needing a proxy server.

* Use [Auto SS Config](https://github.com/lzwjava/lzwjava.github.io/blob/main/scripts/auto-ss-config/upload_configs.py) to generate and upload Shadowsocks or Clash subscription URLs.

* Use the snapshot functionality in Digital Ocean. If the IP of the server is banned, create a new droplet from the snapshot of the server and run `install.sh` again.

* Use the reserved IP functionality in Digital Ocean. If the server's IP is banned, assign a new reserved IP.

* We use Outline Manager to set up our own servers because it is fast and allows us to enjoy the server by ourselves. VPN provider's nodes can often be unreliable. Our servers may also experience issues, but we have much more detailed knowledge of the situation. We can also choose different cloud providers. Additionally, we know whether we are using China Telecom or China Mobile, and whether we are using home Wi-Fi or cellular data.

* It is probably not useful to install OpenWrt on a router to set up a proxy. The main issue is that the GFW can easily ban your proxy server's IP address. It's better to use a subscription method, like with Clash, to easily change settings on your router.
