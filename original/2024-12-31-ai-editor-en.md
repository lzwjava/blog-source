I have tried several AI code editing tools, including GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Cursor. Here are my observations:

- **Windsurf**: Windsurf's chat panel allows you to run commands directly, modify code or text, and then prompt you to accept or reject the changes.
- **Cursor**: Cursor integrates with the command palette (using Command + L), enabling you to write prompts directly in the code panel and confirm changes.
- **Devin**: Devin requires a subscription of $500 USD per month to try.

These tools offer different features and integration methods, catering to various coding preferences and workflows. However, while they handle the code editing part well, they lack integration with cloud platforms and deployment processes.

Additionally, the experience of software development still matters. AI code editors can assist with code generation and modifications, but they cannot ensure that the main code is correct and functional before moving on to the testing phase. Human expertise and oversight remain crucial in the development process.
