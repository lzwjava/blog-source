- I lived 2km from Jinfeng subway station. The office was in Tianhe district.

- From home, I would go to Jinfeng terminal, take Line 6 to Tianhe Coach terminal, then take Line 3 to Shipaiqiao terminal, and then walk 500m to the office.

- I once went from Jinfeng Terminal, took Line 6 to Tianhe Coach Terminal, transferred to Line 3 to Tiyu Xilu Road Terminal, and then continued on Line 3 to Shipaiqiao Terminal—all because I missed my stop at one of the terminals.

- A Didi car cost around 60 CNY per trip. A Gaode car cost around 40 CNY per trip.

- The Night 68 Bus goes directly between home and the office, without needing to transfer to other lines.

- Parking costs around 16 CNY per hour in that area.

- Save energy during your commute to work on something that matters more. Or use your commute as a distraction to focus on something that is less painful.

- Use the Shortcuts app to set a shortcut for when you arrive at the office. The Shortcuts app will open the WeCom app to punch your card.
