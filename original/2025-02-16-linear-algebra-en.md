- Singular Value Decomposition can be used for image compression.

- The determinant of a matrix indicates how much the area would change if the matrix were applied to a shape.

- The eigenvalues are defined by the equation \[ \det(\lambda I - A) = 0 \].

- NumPy's `linalg` package can be used to study and solve problems in linear algebra.  

- Use linear algebra transforms in n-dimensional **space** to understand matrices.  

- A matrix is a group of numbers arranged in rows and columns.  

- The equation \[ Ax = B \] has a solution when \[ \text{rank}(A) = \text{rank}(B) \].  

- The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns) in its **echelon form**.
