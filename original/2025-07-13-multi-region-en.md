For international companies, there are often projects that serve multiple regions' people, like Singapore, Hong Kong, UK, USA, and China.

I have worked on some projects that serve multiple regions' users. Doing it right in backend projects is not easy.

For Standard Chartered Bank, there are apps like SC Mobile India and SC Mobile Hong Kong. For McDonald's, there are versions like McDonald's China and McDonald's USA. For Starbucks, there are Starbucks USA and Starbucks China. Essentially, they provide different countries with their own apps. Often, the login methods differ for users in China and international users. Besides using mobile phones, Chinese users often have the option to log in with WeChat, while international users can log in with Facebook, Google, or Apple. 

These apps likely use different backend servers and have some differing features, but they maintain the same design language. This is probably wrong to do that. In the first years, it seems simple or doable. But after a decade, they will know it is very painful. The maintenance cost or synchronization cost, the testing cost—there are tons of duplicate efforts.

However, for Facebook, Google, or Apple Pay, it is kind of simple. Someone may say they are not financial apps; they have some compliance rules that need to be followed. It is not true. The compliance often means the database server, or the database, or some data that government departments want to check or for audit companies to do audits. However, other efforts are the same. The software is very flexible. We should let code be in the same repository, we should use data source configuration to host different regions' data, and we should share the same code, same design, same workflow, and same testing as much as possible.

Apple Pay is a good example of this. The App Store is also a good example of this. They serve every country too.

There are probably some projects in big tech companies that use continents to separate, like Asia and Pacific area, North America. For these too.

The first thing when doing multi-region development is to know what's different, what's the compliance that we must follow, and how to reduce duplicate efforts as much as possible.

For text-to-speech, Google Cloud needs to train different languages. They provide different models and different languages for it. For languages, the differences between languages are their sounds and their character appearance. The former means when using Google Cloud to do text-to-speech, we need to use different models. For their character appearance, that means when doing PDF generation, we need to be careful about its font selection.

For multi-region projects, in Spring Boot projects, we can use its aliases and different object initialization to do so. We can use properties or YAML configuration smartly. We can put all different logic based on region into some specific modules or classes.

And for code hosting, different branches for different countries seem easy at first, but after some years, you will know how painful it is. You need to git cherry-pick for other regions. And you need to test again in another branch. Whenever doing every small change, you need to synchronize to branches. And as time goes by, if we don't put our effort into minimizing the code or logic differences, the differences in the code between multiple regions or countries become large enough to be impossible to fix.

The good news is that now AI can help us to refactor or write better code, or fix the multi-region code design issues. No matter how big the mistake is, when we fix it, it is a small mistake.

Not only for coding, deployment, and release maintenance, but also for extensibility. Consider how to add a new country or region. How much effort will that require? If it is minimal or just involves some configuration, then our design is great. If it takes a few months, that's acceptable too. If it takes several years, will we still proceed with it?

In Yin Wang's essay, [On Linux，Windows And Mac](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2013/03/07/linux-windows-mac), he mentioned that an Adobe designer told him they spent two years migrating Photoshop from Windows to macOS.

Will supporting a new region require two years of adaptation? For some projects, it might. This is a critical design consideration.

The world is becoming more connected. No matter which country or region we initially target, we must also consider other regions. It's better to get it right from the start. For established international companies, it's advisable to develop software products for at least two countries or regions from the outset. Maintain this multi-region mindset from the beginning. If we have more engineering resources, we can support more countries or regions.
