title: Tips for Finding the Cofounder
---

- If I were to start my startup again, how would I find my cofounder?
- It should be like this: If Yin Wang were starting a startup, he/she should find me. I am one of his most active 20 followers. I have followed him for ten years and agree with most of what he/she says. I’ve learned a lot from him.
- Just like Daniel P. Friedman found his cofounder, he/she should have found Yin Wang.
- You don’t need to find a cofounder who is equally skilled or similar to you. What matters is that they are eager to learn and share a passion for pursuing the truth. Since you both value truth, you will likely agree with each other and sometimes challenge each other's mistakes.
- Because they are eager to learn, I can trust them to share the new knowledge I find.
- One good cofounder is better than ten mediocre collaborators.
- Trust and being like-minded are the most important qualities.
- It’s like finding a spouse, but in some ways, it’s even more important than that.
- One cofounder is fine. Three is okay too, as long as everyone gets along.
- Make sure your cofounders can stick with you through the toughest times.
- Ensure that your cofounder is someone who can grow with you, so that after 10 years, you can hand over a successful startup or a public company to them.
- Think long-term and focus on the essence of this matter.
- Like large companies, it may take a lot of time to find the right cofounder. It could take 2 years to find the right one. You will meet a lot of people or reconnect with old buddies, and eventually, you will find the right person.
- We prefer not to use money to find a cofounder, as it requires considerable effort. Instead, you need to rely primarily on your patience and judgment, as recruiters won’t be helpful in this process. It’s best to trust your own firsthand impressions and decisions.
- The partner we have is likely the most suitable one, though there will be disagreements. Think about the bigger picture. If our startup project isn’t too challenging, we might find a partner more easily.
- Think about everyone you meet and every collaborator you have. Reflect on why some of you couldn’t last long or go far together, or why some friendships have lasted.
- Create a small team. It works best with fewer than 10 people in the current AI era.
- Startup or life can be long. So, from the perspective of startup or life, think about what matters. And find the counter who shares the same thoughts in their deep heart.
- People speak, write, think, code, or conduct research. Judge them based on the quality of these actions, but not too quickly; true understanding comes only after months or years of getting to know each other or sharing many experiences together.
