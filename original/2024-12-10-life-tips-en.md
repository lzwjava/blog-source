## Life Tips

* Explore the world early, go to different countries, and talk to different people.

* Read many books, especially non-fiction ones.

* Always think of better ways to do things.

* Think like a genius, suspect everything, especially authorities.

* Treat people equally. Be kind. Don't look down on people who are no better than you in terms of grades or salary. They didn't lie to you, trick you, or steal your money.

* Be careful of the powerful people behind the government. Some may hurt you from behind.

* If something happens, usually someone wants it to happen. Think hard about things that happen coincidentally or intentionally.

* Think hard about what is good or bad, and how everything gets invented or developed.

* Think about how to live in this world in the best ways.

* Get a lot of things that are free, such as free apps, books, and information. Enjoy air, sun, scenes, and water.

* Think hard about the rules. Figure out the original intention behind them. Ask yourself if the rules could be better or more detailed. Sometimes, we have to follow the rules. But do not let them limit your thinking.

* Treat everything as a learning experience. If it is good, it is nice. If it is bad, avoid it next time.

* Pursue truth. But be careful with science. Not all science is really true.

* Be safe. Health is the most important thing. Our body is really amazing.

* Eat natural or fresh things as much as possible. Eat fruits instead of snacks. Modern society invents too many foods. Prefer natural or less processed ones. Live long and explore more.

* Don't pursue miracles. Life itself is a miracle.

* Don't live for recognition or fame. We don't need recognition when we are born. We need security. Parents punish us when they don't approve of our behaviors. So gradually, we need recognition to get security. But those two are different things.

* It's okay to do anything as long as it doesn't involve or hurt anyone else.

* It's better to learn the truth first. So we don't need to change later.

* English is the world language now. Be good at it and use it like a native language.

* You don't need to change anyone. If you discover something or create something that people want, they will come.

* Don't get desperate. The majority of the world is helping. They are making products or providing services for cheap or free.

* When it comes to money, think about how the richest or smartest people do it.

* Normally, you can't force anyone to do anything, and others can't force you to do anything either.

* Follow your true passion. You can't force yourself to do things you don't like for a long time.

* You are upset that something doesn't work as expected. Just accept the facts or change your worldview to adapt to it. Learn from it.

* The good welfare of you depends yourself, your family, your company, your country. Comparing them wisely in the world. If they are all good, you will have good life. 

* Almost everything can be changed. Think about your nationality. Think about where you were born. Remove every limit and start thinking about how to have the best life in the world. Start to notice the big gap and work towards closing it.

* Humans are born to learn. If every piece of knowledge is taught correctly or you explore and reflect on it often, you will be happy to gain it.

* Think often about what Yin Wang or Daniel P. Friedman says. They are probably the smartest and kindest people in the world.

* The world will have more freedom. The world will become better as knowledge and technology evolve.

* Focus on learning Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). These fields are generally based on reproducible and verifiable facts, unlike some other areas of knowledge. Prioritize learning correct information initially to avoid needing to correct your understanding or habits later.

* Learning AI/STEM is better than learning additional natural languages, as they are a more essential way to understand and interact with the world.

* Your perception of your salary matters more than the amount itself. If you compare it to others, it will likely never feel sufficient. Also, how you spend your salary matters; if you buy what you need daily at a low cost, you might feel it is adequate. For example, using it to buy food or a mobile phone might feel more justifiable, but using your salary to buy a house might not seem as worthwhile.

* Try a lot of products or services. Try a lot of options, sizes, brands, and varieties. People work hard to manufacture or provide them. There are so many free or cheap valuable things.

* When dealing with car insurance, ensure repairs are done as inexpensively as possible to keep next year's fees from increasing significantly. Although the insurance company currently covers the cost, it will ultimately affect your premiums. Once, my headlight was slightly damaged, but they replaced it with a new one. Next time, avoid doing this.

## Productivity Tips

* Focus at work doesn't always happen as you might expect. Surprisingly, noisy or interrupted environments, like when babysitting children, can sometimes boost productivity. Your mood and mental state significantly influence your ability to concentrate, much like how they affect sleep quality.

* The main dilemma of the world is that knowledge and invention are increasing, however, our focus and study are becoming harder. Most days, it's challenging to sit down and read books or watch courses. You can't force yourself to focus, just like you can't force yourself to fall asleep.

* To address this, I like to walk and drive a lot while listening to lectures or watching videos. Covering 10,000 kilometers and walking 5,000 steps every day has helped me become fluent in English and pass the IELTS exam. Now, I hope it can also help me learn math and AI. The key is to avoid mobile phone distractions and remain calm. I encourage others to try this method and provide me with feedback.

* Have fun and work on your own projects often.

* Experiment with different approaches to find what comes naturally to you. Pay attention to what actually works in practice rather than wishful thinking. Trust your instincts and physical responses as reliable indicators.

* The ways people read, write, or code vary significantly. Personally, I often prefer printing papers to read them.

* Less is more. Smaller, focused teams in companies often outperform larger teams, even when the larger teams have 10x or 100x more people, due to better communication and coordination.

* I read parts of "The Mythical Man-Month" by Fred Brooks. Its principles about software project management remain relevant in the long term.

* No productivity method works automatically - you need to experiment and adapt techniques to find what works best for your specific needs.

* Use urges to do things. Don't force yourself. Always do what you want at the moment. This is fulfilling.

* Use code or other tools to automate tasks, allowing you to focus on the most interesting aspects.

* When you truly enjoy working or learning, you don't worry about progress, and you don't have a goal to rush towards. You simply want to do or learn things for their own sake. You don't worry about how much time has passed or the difficulty of the materials. You enter a flow state.

* Sometimes, it's hard to focus—even just reading a tutorial on the screen can be difficult. However, when you're writing code and get stuck on a bug, you may find yourself fully focused. Try to find ways to write and run code as part of your learning process.

* There are several ways to learn something. Get hands-on and use AI to help you learn or conduct experiments. You could also work through a book or a series of course videos in a fixed order, or learn by taking exams or answering questions. Basically, you can learn with a plan or learn by following your mood. Learning can be curiosity-driven or success-driven. Always choose to learn by mood.

## Learning Tips

* Treat learning as a hobby by approaching with playfulness and genuine interest.

* Learn through practice and repetition until mastery comes through hands-on experience.

* Use daily immersion by engaging with the subject regularly in natural contexts.

* Follow your genuine interests because passion leads to better learning outcomes.

* Draw from multiple sources whenever you need simpler explanations.

* Persist through difficulties by taking breaks and seeking inspiration from peers.

* Maintain consistent engagement instead of relying on cramming sessions.

* Create opportunities to actively apply what you're learning.

* Make learning practical by connecting it to real-life applications.

* Remember that learning comes naturally through play and exploration.

* Learn with AI tools, ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini.

* Use multiple languages to ask AI tools questions.

* Use YouTube, YouTube shorts or TikTok to search for video explanations.

* Download YouTube courses to listen to while driving, try to recall or imagine what you listen to.

* Emotions come and go - when you can't focus, try using other ways to learn, or do something else, then come back.

* It is ok to not fully understand a question or paragraph in one go - just skip it and try to understand it next time, or the time after that.

* In school, I learned by listening to teachers and doing exercises. After leaving school, I learned by doing work, projects and pursuing hobbies. Reflect on how you learned things in the past. Use those methods to learn current matters.

* Action produces information. Just move forward to learn new things.

* Take exams, interviews, certificates, finish tasks to achieve excellence.

* Do not just watch videos of the subjects pretending to understand.

* Most of the time you think you have already prepared well, but actually haven't. Aim high to achieve middle results. Aim for middle to achieve low results.

* Sleep well. Take naps if tired.

* Attitude or motivation is hard to lie to yourself about. Follow your true passion.

* Environment is important. You don't need to learn English hard if you grow up in English-speaking countries.

* Your brain is powerful. Think things through by yourself. Think again and again, time after time.

* Grab the essence or principle of things to learn. For example, machine learning is about calculus, and startups are about making something people want.

* You don't need to learn something to prove yourself to others. New discoveries take time to become popular. Your abilities take time to become truly good. Others will then notice.

* Learning is mainly about trying new things or thinking in new ways. Keep exploring.

* To learn is to better enjoy life. For example, learning a new language is like opening a new world. 

* When learning a subject, directly approaching the core concepts or doing the final exam exercises is okay. You can learn backward to the fundamental things. A hard start leads to an easy end. Quickly overcome the fear or discomfort associated with new knowledge. 

* Teach or share what you learn to others, one piece at a time. No matter how technical or sophisticated it is, share it with your companion, friends, or even street buddies. 

* Write blogs, make videos, or create other content to share. People are narcissistic. By reviewing what you create, you will notice imperfections. That will give you the urge to improve.

* Learn the history of things, like some specific math, electricity, or programming. It shows how things develop and the strong reasons for the order in which they appear. These parts are what textbooks miss.

* Often, if you learn a topic and encounter some difficulty, just repeat watching a video, listening to it, or reading materials about it around 20 times—it can have a magical effect. As June Huh said, repetition has some beauty.

## Money Spending Tips

* Find free solutions first - open source software, free ebooks, papers, information etc.

* Prefer affordable items. Many things under 100 CNY are quite good quality. You're less likely to suffer a loss or be cheated.

* I bought an iPhone with 512GB storage, but 256GB would have been enough. Photos and videos take up half my space. There are solutions like syncing to computer or using iCloud. Usually, a moderate solution works fine.

* Instead of buying things just to use, buy things to learn from. Regularly buy new affordable items that you can learn from.

* Carefully observe what people are using. Be less influenced by media.

* I bought some mechanical tools, phone repair tools, and maintenance tools. They're quite useful - I can learn from them and use them occasionally.

* Protect your belongings. Use covers to protect your computer or iPhone.

* If something is inexpensive, buy several units, like charging adapters or electrical cables.

* You learn what's good or bad by using things, especially over long periods. Keep an eye on your items - for example, you might need to change a MacBook battery after 5-8 years.

* Don't buy things just to show off, like houses or cars. The price of vanity keeps getting higher.

* For learning, the key is to focus your mind on the subject rather than expensive materials or courses. Most things can be learned for free.

* Analyze why you don't use expensive items you've bought. Often it's due to lack of time, actual need, or genuine interest.

* Focus on essence rather than appearance. Drinks in pouches are often cheaper than boxed drinks. Compare prices per 100ml for the same type of juice - pouch drinks are usually more economical.

* Learn more details to make better purchases.

* The first purchase is important, especially for expensive items requiring bank loans. Start with cheaper options to try - like with housing.

* Consider different solutions: when playing basketball with glasses, you could buy sports goggles, use a strap to secure regular glasses, or keep spare pairs. Think about long-term costs and effectiveness. Apply this thinking to other purchasing decisions.

* Purchase components like batteries or other parts from an online store and visit a local repair shop for installation, such as replacing the battery in a mobile phone or laptop.

## Innovation Tips

- Innovation means trying new things.

- The value of innovation is amazing. It doesn't matter if there are a million or a billion people. Sometimes, nobody can think of something new.

- In a group of 10 or 20 engineers, some individuals are able to think in new ways, using new tools or different approaches to help the project. I admire them.

- In the current world, this AI era, the power of innovation is becoming more and more important.

- AI is innovation. The "Attention Is All You Need" paper is innovation. A different way to query a database is innovation. The ways that surrounding peers seldom do or think about that actually help are innovations. Innovation is everywhere.

- Sometimes, new ways of doing things are innovations for me, for a group of people, for a small startup, for big companies, for a large country, or for human beings.

- People don't inherently hate innovation, but rather hate innovation that will hurt their interests. Some of Nokia's employees hated Apple's innovation. In the 1600s, influential figures within the Catholic Church hated Galileo's heliocentric innovation.

- Before innovators try new things, they have already tried a lot of old things, and someday, somehow, they come up with new ideas.

- While the majority might notice a few innovations from some people, those individuals have usually already made a lot of innovations.

- Trying new things doesn't always guarantee success. They sometimes show a decline instead of progress. Be critical and observant.
