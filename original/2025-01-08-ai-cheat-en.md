title: Emphasize Judgment Over Worrying About AI Cheating
---

- AI cheating is pervasive and, likely, impossible to fully eliminate.
- Rather than focusing on AI cheating, we should prioritize raising our own judgment.
- Concepts like multi-head latent attention, or systems like ChatGPT-o1 and DeepSeek V3, are still challenging to achieve, even with AI cheating.
- We should place a higher value on repeatability and reproducibility in work.
- Whether the work is done by AI or humans, as long as it benefits others, it holds value. However, proper credit should always be given.
- Original thinkers and teams deserve more respect than ever before.
- Instead of worrying about AI cheating, we should become more ambitious about the future and focus on building it—without being overly concerned with credits.
- Cheating ultimately boils down to honest and moral judgment.
- In interviews and offline exams, it's still difficult to cheat.
