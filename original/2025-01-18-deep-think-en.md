title: Use DeepThink or ChatGPT o1 A Lot
---

OpenAI's o1 was released on December 5, 2024. DeepSeek-V3 was released on December 26, 2024.

In a previous article, I wrote [What ChatGPT o1 Can Do That 4o-mini Cannot](/o1-en).

They are underestimated. However, some information, like the working code for Google Speech-To-Text, is found within the dialogue of the product demo. This kind of information is hidden there, and it's also quite new.

So, in this case, o1 or DeepThink may not be effective.

They have search functionality, but they are only able to search surface-level content. They are not able to find information that requires user login and enabled APIs.

They excel at considering every scenario, questioning and challenging themselves extensively to arrive at potentially correct answers.

It's truly interesting to directly tackle a problem, and if DeepThink or ChatGPT o1 are unable to solve it, it certainly indicates something significant.

One use case is for companies, providing registered users with full demo capabilities. This acts like an internet robot, gathering public data to enhance LLMs or search engines.

Another use case is for hardware manufacturers. We will use robots to interact with them, generating as much relevant information as possible.
