Is it still useful to write blogs now that we have large language models (LLMs)? If LLMs contain the information you want to share and people use LLMs more, do we still need to provide our own information?

From this perspective, the information LLMs couldn't provide holds much more value. New discoveries or lesser-known truths will be usable in the future.

Even before LLMs, we used search engines frequently. Search engines redirect users to your website, providing both credit and traffic to your site. In the mobile era, a lot of information is produced within apps, such as the WeChat subscription platform or X (formerly Twitter).

From an information usefulness standpoint, you certainly don't need to write anything that is already easily searchable, such as how to perform calculations, how to download apps from the App Store, or how to use a phone. But this information is still useful for children or elderly people.

LLMs contain the majority of the Internet's information and now have search functionality to access real-time data.

However, LLMs don't contain a lot of private information. They don't have my private details like passwords, bank numbers, addresses, private chat history, or medical reports. I don't know whether my photos are leaked, as many apps can access them, and some of my photos are stored on cloud servers like Google Photos.

If something is digital, it can easily be leaked, even if it's stored on cloud servers, despite companies claiming to protect your privacy.

Therefore, many of my private documents or information that aren't digitized are not found in search engines or LLMs.

Basically, we aren't interested in the private information of others unless we like them or need it. People care about themselves a lot.

Turning back to how to provide useful information and succeed in this world, AI research engineers and scientists are in high demand. There are numerous hot AI startups and products, as well as popular blockchain startups and coins.

Useful assets for humans can be found at [Companies Market Cap](https://companiesmarketcap.com). They include public companies, precious metals, cryptocurrencies, and ETFs.

Information is just one aspect of life. There are energy, oil, electricity, cars, medicines, drugs, services, and clothing. We not only need information but also the products or services that information actually helps us create. Additionally, we need time.

Do we actually need money? We need security, and we use money to buy what we want. If we have valuable skills, we can earn money by creating value.

We try to predict the future. If we want to succeed and live well, we need to consider how we are positioned in that future world.

For me, the best way to create value is to research the latest AI technologies, such as ChatGPT o1, DeepSeek, and NVIDIA GPUs.

Writing blogs is a way to learn. Just like top AI talents today, writing blogs to share new ideas and techniques is a habit for them. With AI tools helping, it is easier to refine and enhance content.

The best way for me to use the latest AI is to learn about it, share information about it, and create more advanced AI.

Regarding the blockchain part, my best approach is to use what I earn to regularly invest in Bitcoin, as I don't have much more energy to put into the blockchain world. I heard about Solana recently. It is cool.

I thought out a solution for what I do, but what about where I live and who I live with? I want to live in a top AI area; currently, it is San Francisco. However, the internet has no barriers—DeepSeek in China and Mistral in France are also doing a good job. Additionally, I am a college dropout now, getting my associate degree. This has caused some trouble for me in working outside of China. It is important to choose where to live.

So, the latest version of the best way for me to live is to use the latest AI to reside in an AI-friendly city, to learn, share, and create the next more advanced AI. I will use my salary to invest in a few top AI stocks or Bitcoin.
