## Beyond Expectations

*2025.07.30*

While it is good to keep your promise, it is better to go beyond expectations.

In corporate life, or in personal life, doing things beyond expectations gives people pleasant surprises.

In corporate life, going beyond expectations means you deliver faster or better than what your colleagues expect. It means not only does your work meet the requirements set by the company, but the quality of your work exceeds what is supposed to be.

In personal life, going beyond expectations means that you can help others in unexpected ways. Think of 7 billion people—how many people can help you? While they do their best work, you buying their services or products is the way they help you a lot.

Also, my teacher Yin Wang is exceptionally good at this. He always teaches me beyond my expectations. I can never reach that level of intelligence. I often reread his essays; however, no matter how many times I read them, I still find something very useful.

For corporate life, you do what you are assigned to do. That is probably a basic requirement, and it should be. But how can you do something beyond the requirement?

The answer is to use AI tools effectively. Companies may provide AI chatbots for people to use. However, in my view, it is not just intelligent chatbots, but AI agents, prompt engineering, and context engineering.

Their usefulness just sits there waiting for you to discover. Because AI models are trained on billions of tokens—most of human existing knowledge—AI chatbots are just a way to compress and decompress this knowledge.

Let's return to our topic. When we want to work better and get good feedback, we need to hold some secrets. We don't show all the work or all the ideas we have. Instead, we hide some to let employers or team leads be surprised.

One popular idea on social media is that you shouldn't share too much or be too needy. That's good advice.

It is not just for working as an employee, but for users too. Airbnb is good at doing things beyond expectations.

There are already a lot of workers, products, and services. But things that are beyond expectations are always few.

ChatGPT is beyond expectation. DeepSeek is beyond expectation.

Having results that are beyond expectation means that they are good, and somehow exceptionally good.

## Avoid Seeking Validation

*2025.07.12*

Seeking validation is probably common for most people. You need validation from parents, teachers, bosses, and others to survive or thrive in society.

If one is very rich, does one need validation? One may become very selective. One often gives validation to others instead of seeking it. One just doesn't care about the opinions of others.

Has my teacher Yin Wang ever sought validation? It seems not. He dropped out of Tsinghua, Cornell, and Indiana Bloomington. He quit Microsoft, Intel, Google, etc.

As a person who seeks a lot of validation, I am learning from Yin Wang and starting to avoid seeking validation.

One forms this habit from very early on. One needs validation from parents to avoid being punished by them.

But what parents agree on may not be correct. Does playing on a mobile phone a lot to watch animations hurt their eyes? By wearing farsighted glasses, when they look at a mobile phone, it's just like watching a TV 5 meters away. Their eyes won't be deformed.

Is it probably hard to make kids wear farsighted glasses when watching animations on a mobile phone? I don't think so. If kids can choose between watching animations on a mobile phone while wearing eyeglasses or not watching them at all, I think most kids will choose the former.

So actually, a lot of thoughts or ideas from parents or average adults are not correct, or not absolutely correct. In this world, there are just so many ways to do things.

In my recent job, what's changed inside me is that I seek much less validation. I worked as a contractor for the same bank that I worked for two years ago, though this time, I am coming from another vendor.

Last time, I remember, when I had just worked for a month, I got my salary and then shared my thankfulness with my manager. I told him that even after logging off, I listened to a lot of backend engineering videos to learn. As I sent messages a little more, he then told me something like "good, keep up the work," and some other things like expressing that he doesn't need to hear those details and telling me to just focus on the job and do it fine—though he wasn't so direct, I could feel it.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao also says that he finds it unbearable to work with those who constantly seek validation. He likes to work with those who are confident. Managers are probably busy and don't have time to listen to things unrelated to the work.

My need to seek validation has also caused other trouble for me. It's like I want to prove myself too much. It has led to some conflicts with others. One thing is that it gets me involved in something I'm not responsible for. However, what I'm thinking is that I should speak out to make it better. Though I have a good heart and want things to become better, the way to do so is not by telling others how to do it. Correcting others is painful. I don't want to be corrected either.

In my recent job, I seldom seek validation and just do the job. Then it's fine, and I got some good feedback.

Another change in me is that I stopped posting in WeChat Moments almost two years ago. Before, I thought WeChat Moments was the world. Now, I think that WeChat Moments is to the world just like Line Status is to Japanese people. It doesn't matter as much as you think.

The world is very large. I lived in Guangzhou for a total of 15 years in two non-consecutive residences—half of my life as of now. If you take Guangzhou as the granted world, then it's probably wrong. One day, maybe I'll work in another city in another country, and develop code for billions of people to use.

Seeking validation is insecure behavior. That's a deep-rooted problem. It's hard to fix that. You need to find out what leads to it and start to fix the reason. You need to face fear directly.

The biggest fear for humans is probably death. If you start to embrace it, you have no regrets about living in this world at this moment. You think you have lived a good life. You think you do what you want to do. The more you think about it, the more you will feel secure.

I read some books by Morita Shoma. There are a lot of stories about fighting with self-contradictory mindsets. Pain is unavoidable. We accept it and continue to do what we should do instead of avoiding it. Things will start to get better.

Avoiding seeking validation saves your time and others' time too. It helps you find the trueness of yourself and the world. Humans are just a small part of the world. Their validation isn't that important, so why seek it?

Yin Wang's Weibo name became "the Yin who doesn't care about human beings anymore." I didn't understand it initially. After mulling over it time and time again in recent years, I start to appreciate it.

Newton didn't care about his fellows, so he found the principles of nature. Yin Wang doesn't care about his fellows, so he found the principles of computer programs and beyond. They don't seek validation and sometimes even hide what they discover to avoid arguments with people who are seeking validation.

## Avoid Being Proud After Achieving Some Success

*2025.07.12*

This is one of the easy mistakes I have made again and again. I often do well when I am the underdog. However, if I think I am kind of successful, then I will fall into a hole.

In my adult life, most of the time, I liked posting in WeChat Moments. That made me seek too much validation and care about the opinions of others too much.

And in investing, I have done this so many times: become too happy when an investment finally works, and then break my regular investing practice and start to suddenly invest more. So it raises my average price and quickly leads to losses if the market turns upside down.

After getting users for my product and receiving an investment, I started hiring employees and tried to delegate, wanting to switch from founder mode to manager mode. This decision cost my company half a million CNY—a significant loss for a 22-year-old in China.

And after securing a job working as a contractor for a big bank, and learning English well, I thought that I was going to thrive in international companies in China to avoid its declining domestic market, and that I should be able to carry 1.2 million in debt. I was wrong too.

These lessons hit very hard. The first time, about losing half a million in one year, I spent two years hiring 20 part-time engineers to do 50 software projects to cover it up. The second time, which I am still recovering from, it will probably take me 10 years to fix that due to the hard economy and my own inability to achieve the next level of excellence.

Avoid being proud after achieving some success. Keep a peaceful mind. The accidents in my life due to myself (body or mental) or external factors could probably happen at any moment.
