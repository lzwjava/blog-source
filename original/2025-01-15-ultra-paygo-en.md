title: Ultra Paygo USA SIM Card
---

I recently purchased an Ultra Paygo SIM card. My goal was to buy an Apple gift card through Walmart's app, which requires a US phone number for verification. This led me to purchase the Ultra Paygo SIM.

The service is provided by [Ultra Mobile](https://www.ultramobile.com).

My experience with Ultra Paygo is similar to that of Giffgaff. However, unlike Giffgaff, I was unable to get 4G data service. Although my phone displayed an LTE signal, I couldn't access the internet.

Therefore, the SIM card effectively only provides a US phone number and SMS functionality. Unfortunately, the Walmart app requires a Visa card issued by a US bank, which I do not have. Consequently, I was unable to purchase the Apple gift card through Walmart.

I remember that in 2016 and 2017, when I visited the USA for about 20 days each year, I used a T-Mobile SIM card.

Their relationship is as follows:

> Ultra Mobile is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) that uses T-Mobile's cellular network.

It costs $3 USD per month. I'm unsure if I will continue using it long-term.
